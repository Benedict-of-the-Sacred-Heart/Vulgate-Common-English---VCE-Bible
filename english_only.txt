Genesis 1:1 In the beginning, God created the universe and the earth.
Genesis 1:2 The earth wasn't finished yet.
The matter of the earth was present but not yet formed or inhabited, and it was dark,
and God's Spirit was there, hovering over the unformed earth.
Genesis 1:3 God then created light by saying "Let there be light!"
Genesis 1:4 God saw that the light was good
and caused the light to travel through the darkness of space.
Genesis 1:5 He called the time when it is bright "day",
and the time when it is dark "night". The first ever evening and morning passed—the first day of all of history.
Genesis 1:6 And God said: "Let there be an atmosphere to separate Earth from the rest of creation."
Genesis 1:7 So God made the atmosphere
between the unformed Earth
and the rest of the universe that was still being formed,
and the Earth was separated from the rest of the universe.
Genesis 1:8 He called the atmosphere "the sky".
Evening and morning then came, the second day.
Genesis 1:9 God said "Let the oceans and land of the earth appear and take their proper places."
And it was immediately so.
Genesis 1:10 And God called the oceans "the sea"
and the dry ground "land",
and God saw that it was good.
Genesis 1:11 And God said, “Let the earth sprout every sort of plant.
Let there be all types of grasses, herbs, and trees, including those that produce fruit.
Let the plants produce seeds that grow into the same species of plant.”
After God said this, the earth was filled with plant life.
Genesis 1:12 The earth then produced lush plant life. It brought forth all types of grasses and herbs, each with seeds that would reproduce its own kind. It also brought forth trees that produced fruit, each with its own seeds that would reproduce its own kind. God saw that this was good.
Genesis 1:13 Evening and morning passed; it was the third day.
Genesis 1:14 God then said, "Let there be sources of light in the sky to separate day from night. Let them serve as indicators for marking holy days, seasons, days, and years.
Genesis 1:15 Let them shine in the sky to illuminate the earth." And so it was.
Genesis 1:16 God created two great sources of light: the sun, the greater light, to govern the day, and the moon, the lesser light, to govern the night. He also created the stars.
Genesis 1:17 God placed these sources of light in the sky to shine upon the earth,
Genesis 1:18 and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw that this was good.
Genesis 1:19 Evening and morning passed; it was the fourth day.
Genesis 1:20 God also said, "Let the waters teem with every type of living creature, and let birds fly above the earth, across the sky."
Genesis 1:21 So God created the great sea monsters and every other living creature that moves, with which the waters teem, each according to its species. He also created every winged bird according to its species. God saw that this was good.
Genesis 1:22 God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas. And let the birds multiply on the earth."
Genesis 1:23 Evening and morning passed; it was the fifth day.
Genesis 1:24 God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its species." And so it was.
Genesis 1:25 God made the wild animals of the earth according to their species, the cattle according to their species, and all creatures that move along the ground according to their species. God saw that this was good.
Genesis 1:26 Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, over the cattle, over all the earth, and over every creature that moves along the ground."
Genesis 1:27 So God created man in His own image; in the image of God, He created him. He created them male and female.
Genesis 1:28 God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living creature that moves on the earth."
Genesis 1:29 Then God said, "Look, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the entire earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. These will be your food.
Genesis 1:30 And to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the sky, and to every creature that moves along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food." And so it was.
Genesis 1:31 God looked at everything He had made, and indeed, it was very good. Evening and morning passed; it was the sixth day.
Genesis 2:1 So, the universe and the earth, and all that fills them, were finished.
Genesis 2:2 By the seventh day, God had finished all the work of creation He had been doing. He ceased His work on the seventh day, resting from everything He had made.
Genesis 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on that day He had finished all His work of creation.
Genesis 2:4 This is the historical account of the universe and the earth at their creation, at the time when the Lord God made the universe and the earth.
Genesis 2:5 There was no plant yet growing in the field, nor had any herb of the region sprouted. For the Lord God had not yet caused rain to fall upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the land.
Genesis 2:6 Instead, a spring of water would rise up from the earth, watering the entire surface of the ground.
Genesis 2:7 So the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and He breathed into his face the breath of life, and thus man became a living soul.
Genesis 2:8 Then the Lord God had planted a garden of delight from the beginning in the East, and there He placed the man whom He had formed.
Genesis 2:9 And the Lord God caused to grow from the ground every tree that was pleasing to the eye and good for food. He also placed the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis 2:10 A river flowed out of the place of delight to water the garden, and from there it divided into four branches.
Genesis 2:11 The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the entire land of Havilah, where gold is found.
Genesis 2:12 The gold of that land is of excellent quality. Bdellium (a fragrant resin) and the onyx stone are also found there.
Genesis 2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the entire land of Cush (Ethiopia).
Genesis 2:14 The name of the third river is Tigris; it flows eastward toward Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis 2:15 Therefore, the Lord God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Delight to cultivate and keep it.
Genesis 2:16 And the Lord God gave the man this command, saying: "From every tree of the garden you may freely eat.
Genesis 2:17 But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat; for on the day that you eat from it, you will surely die."
Genesis 2:18 Then the Lord God said: "It is not good for man to be alone. I will make him a helper suitable for him."
Genesis 2:19 So, the Lord God, having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the sky, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.
Genesis 2:20 Adam gave names to all the livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to all the beasts of the field. But for Adam himself, no suitable helper was found.
Genesis 2:21 So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam. And while he was sleeping, God took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh in its place.
Genesis 2:22 And the Lord God formed the rib, which He had taken from Adam, into a woman, and He brought her to Adam.
Genesis 2:23 Then Adam said: "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh! She shall be called 'Woman' because she was taken out of Man."
Genesis 2:24 Therefore, a man will leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
Genesis 2:25 And the man and his wife were both naked, but they felt no shame.
Genesis 3:1 Now, the serpent was the most cunning creature among all the animals the Lord God had made on the earth. It came to the woman and said, 'Why did God give you a command that you should not eat from *any* tree in this entire garden?' —the serpent twisted God's actual prohibition, making it sound like they were forbidden from everything.
Genesis 3:2 The woman answered the serpent, 'We may eat the fruit from the trees throughout this garden;'
Genesis 3:3 but from the fruit of the tree that stands in the very center of the garden, God has strictly commanded us not to eat, nor even to touch it—an addition the woman made to God's original command—lest we die.'
Genesis 3:4 But the serpent said to the woman, 'No, you will not die at all!'
Genesis 3:5 For God knows that on the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will become like gods, knowing both good and evil, just as He does.'
Genesis 3:6 Therefore, the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was beautiful to the eyes, and that it was delightful to look at. She then took some of its fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate it.
Genesis 3:7 And the eyes of both of them were indeed opened, not to wisdom but to shame; and when they realized they were naked, they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves to hide their nakedness.
Genesis 3:8 And when they heard the voice of the Lord God, Who was walking about in the garden during the cool afternoon breeze, Adam and his wife immediately hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God, concealing themselves among the trees of the garden.
Genesis 3:9 And the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, 'Where are you?'
Genesis 3:10 He answered, 'I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid myself.'
Genesis 3:11 And God said to him, 'Who told you that you were naked, unless it was because you had eaten from the very tree about which I commanded you not to eat?'
Genesis 3:12 And Adam said, 'The woman You gave to be my companion—she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.'
Genesis 3:13 And the Lord God said to the woman, 'What is this that you have done?' And she replied, 'The serpent cleverly deceived me, and so I ate.'
Genesis 3:14 And the Lord God said to the serpent, 'Because you have done this, you are cursed above all living creatures and all beasts of the earth. You shall crawl on your belly, and you shall metaphorically eat the dust of the earth—meaning, you shall always be humbled and defeated—all the days of your life.'
Genesis 3:15 I will put enmities, a spiritual warfare, between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. She, the Woman, shall crush your head—a prophecy of Mary and her Son, Jesus Christ, triumphing over you—and you, in turn, shall lie in wait for her heel, attempting to wound Him.
Genesis 3:16 To the woman He also said, 'I will greatly multiply your sorrows and your painful conceptions. In great pain you shall give birth to children; and you shall be subject to your husband's authority, and he shall rule over you.'
Genesis 3:17 And to Adam He said, 'Because you listened to the voice of your wife, and ate from the tree concerning which I specifically commanded you, "You shall not eat from it," therefore, the very ground is now cursed because of your deed. You shall eat from it only through hard labor and toil all the days of your life.'
Genesis 3:18 Thorns and thistles shall the earth bring forth for you, and you shall eat the wild plants of the field to survive.
Genesis 3:19 By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the very ground from which you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return in death.
Genesis 3:20 And Adam called the name of his wife 'Eve'—meaning 'life-giver'—because she would be the mother of all who live.
Genesis 3:21 And the Lord God also made garments of animal skins for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them with these, providing a more lasting covering than their fig leaves and foreshadowing future atonement.
Genesis 3:22 And the Lord God said, 'Behold, Adam has now become like one of Us—meaning, like the divine beings in heaven—by knowing good and evil in a fallen way. Now, therefore, lest he reach out his hand and also take from the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever in this fallen state—'
Genesis 3:23 Therefore, the Lord God sent Adam out from the Garden of Eden—the Garden of Pleasure—so that he might work the very ground from which he was taken, as a consequence of his sin.
Genesis 3:24 And so He drove Adam out; and at the eastern side of the Garden of Pleasure, He stationed Cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way, to guard the path to the Tree of Life and prevent humanity from reaching it in their fallen state.
Genesis 4:1 Adam knew his wife, Eve. She conceived and gave birth to Cain, saying, "I have gotten a man through God."
Genesis 4:2 Again, she gave birth to his brother, Abel. Abel became a shepherd of sheep, while Cain was a tiller of the ground.
Genesis 4:3 After a period of many days, Cain brought an offering to the Lord from the produce of the earth.
Genesis 4:4 Abel also offered from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat portions. The Lord looked with favor upon Abel and his offering.
Genesis 4:5 But upon Cain and his offering, He did not look with favor. Cain became extremely angry, and his face fell.
Genesis 4:6 Then the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has your face fallen?"
Genesis 4:7 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is waiting at the door, and its desire is for you, but you must master it.
Genesis 4:8 Cain then spoke to his brother Abel, saying, "Let us go out to the field." When they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and murdered him.
Genesis 4:9 Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" He answered, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?"
Genesis 4:10 And He said to him, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the earth!"
Genesis 4:11 Now, therefore, you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
Genesis 4:12 When you cultivate the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you. You shall be a restless wanderer on the earth.
Genesis 4:13 And Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is too great for me to bear."
Genesis 4:14 Behold, today you are driving me from the face of the earth, and from your presence I shall be hidden. I shall be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
Genesis 4:15 Then the Lord said to him, "Not so! If anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." And the Lord put a protective mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would kill him.
Genesis 4:16 So Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and lived as an exile in the land of Nod, to the east of Eden.
Genesis 4:17 Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Cain then built a city and named it Enoch, after his son.
Genesis 4:18 To Enoch was born Irad. Irad begot Maviael. Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech.
Genesis 4:19 Lamech took two wives. The name of the first was Ada, and the name of the second was Sella.
Genesis 4:20 Ada gave birth to Jabal. He became the father of those who dwell in tents and keep livestock.
Genesis 4:21 His brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all who play the lyre and the pipe.
Genesis 4:22 Sella also gave birth to Tubalcain, who was an instructor and smith in every kind of bronze and iron work. The sister of Tubalcain was Noema.
Genesis 4:23 Then Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Sella: "Hear my voice, wives of Lamech; listen to my speech. For I have killed a man who wounded me, and a young man who bruised me."
Genesis 4:24 If vengeance for Cain was sevenfold, then for Lamech it will be seventy-sevenfold.
Genesis 4:25 Adam knew his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has appointed for me another child in place of Abel, whom Cain murdered."
Genesis 4:26 To Seth also a son was born, whom he named Enos. It was then that people began to invoke the name of the Lord.
Genesis 5:1 This is the record of Adam's lineage. At the time when God created mankind, He made him in God's own likeness.
Genesis 5:2 He created them as male and female. He blessed them, and He called their collective name 'Mankind' (Adam), at the time they were created.
Genesis 5:3 Adam lived for one hundred and thirty years, and then he begot a son in his own image and likeness, whom he named Seth.
Genesis 5:4 After he begot Seth, Adam lived for eight hundred more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.
Genesis 5:5 Adam lived for a total of nine hundred and thirty years, and then he died.
Genesis 5:6 Seth also lived for one hundred and five years, and then he begot Enos.
Genesis 5:7 After he begot Enos, Seth lived for eight hundred and seven more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.
Genesis 5:8 Seth lived for a total of nine hundred and twelve years, and then he died.
Genesis 5:9 Enos lived for ninety years, and then he begot Cainan.
Genesis 5:10 After he begot Cainan, Enos lived for eight hundred and fifteen more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.
Genesis 5:11 Enos lived for a total of nine hundred and five years, and then he died.
Genesis 5:12 Cainan lived for seventy years, and then he begot Malaleel.
Genesis 5:13 After he begot Malaleel, Cainan lived for eight hundred and forty more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.
Genesis 5:14 Cainan lived for a total of nine hundred and ten years, and then he died.
Genesis 5:15 Malaleel lived for sixty-five years, and then he begot Jared.
Genesis 5:16 After he begot Jared, Malaleel lived for eight hundred and thirty more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.
Genesis 5:17 Malaleel lived for a total of eight hundred and ninety-five years, and then he died.
Genesis 5:18 Jared also lived for one hundred and sixty-two years, and then he begot Enoch.
Genesis 5:19 After he begot Enoch, Jared lived for eight hundred more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.
Genesis 5:20 Jared lived for a total of nine hundred and sixty-two years, and then he died.
Genesis 5:21 Enoch lived for sixty-five years, and then he begot Methuselah.
Genesis 5:22 And Enoch walked closely with God. After he begot Methuselah, Enoch lived for three hundred more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.
Genesis 5:23 Enoch lived for a total of three hundred and sixty-five years.
Genesis 5:24 Enoch continued to walk closely with God, and then he was no longer seen, because God took him from the earth.
Genesis 5:25 Methuselah also lived for one hundred and eighty-seven years, and then he begot Lamech.
Genesis 5:26 After he begot Lamech, Methuselah lived for seven hundred and eighty-two more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.
Genesis 5:27 Methuselah lived for a total of nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and then he died.
Genesis 5:28 Lamech lived for one hundred and eighty-two years, and then he begot a son.
Genesis 5:29 He named the boy Noah, saying, 'This son will bring us comfort from our toil and from the hard labor of our hands, which comes from the earth that the Lord God has cursed.'
Genesis 5:30 After he begot Noah, Lamech lived for five hundred and ninety-five more years, during which time he also begot other sons and daughters.
Genesis 5:31 Lamech lived for a total of seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and then he died.
Genesis 5:32 When Noah was five hundred years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Genesis 6:1 And when human beings began to multiply on the earth, and they had given birth to daughters,
Genesis 6:2 the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they chose wives for themselves from all of them whom they desired.
Genesis 6:3 And God said, "My Spirit will not always strive within man, because man is merely flesh. Therefore, his days will be limited to one hundred and twenty years."
Genesis 6:4 Now, giants were on the earth in those days—and even after—when the sons of God had relations with the daughters of men, and they bore children. These were the mighty ones of ancient times, men of renown and fame.
Genesis 6:5 But God saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and without ceasing.
Genesis 6:6 And God regretted that He had made man on the earth. He was grieved in His heart by man's evil.
Genesis 6:7 God said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the earth—from man to beast, from creeping thing to the birds of the sky—for I regret that I have made them."
Genesis 6:8 But Noah found grace and favor in the sight of the Lord.
Genesis 6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man, blameless and upright in his generations; Noah walked with God.
Genesis 6:10 And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Genesis 6:11 The earth, however, was corrupt before God; the earth was filled with iniquity and violence.
Genesis 6:12 When God saw that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth—their moral path was depraved),
Genesis 6:13 God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me; for the earth is filled with iniquity and violence because of them. And behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
Genesis 6:14 Make yourself an ark of smooth, polished gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ark, and you shall pitch it with asphalt inside and out to make it watertight.
Genesis 6:15 And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. (A cubit is approximately 18 inches, so about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, 45 feet high).
Genesis 6:16 You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit above; and the door of the ark you shall set in its side. You shall make lower, second, and third decks in it.
Genesis 6:17 For behold, I, myself, am bringing a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the spirit of life from under the sky. Everything that is on the earth shall die.
Genesis 6:18 But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
Genesis 6:19 And from every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
Genesis 6:20 Of birds after their kind, and of livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come to you, so they may live.
Genesis 6:21 And you shall take for yourself every sort of food that is eaten, and you shall gather it into the ark. And it shall be food for you and for them.
Genesis 6:22 Thus Noah did; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.
Genesis 7:1 The Lord then spoke to Noah, saying, "Go into the ark, you and your whole household. I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation."
Genesis 7:2 "From all of the clean animals, take seven pairs—a male and a female of each. But from the unclean animals, take only two—one male and one female of each."
Genesis 7:3 "And from the birds of the sky, take seven pairs of each, a male and a female. This is so that their offspring may be preserved on the face of the entire earth after the flood."
Genesis 7:4 "For in exactly seven days, I will send rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will then wipe out every living thing that I have made from the face of the earth."
Genesis 7:5 So Noah did everything that the Lord had commanded him to do.
Genesis 7:6 Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters began to swell over the earth.
Genesis 7:7 Noah entered the ark because of the floodwaters. His sons, his wife, and his sons' wives also entered with him.
Genesis 7:8 All the animals, both clean and unclean, and all the birds, and all the creeping creatures that move upon the earth—
Genesis 7:9 —they entered the ark with Noah, two by two, a male and a female of each, just as the Lord had commanded Noah.
Genesis 7:10 After the seven days had passed, the floodwaters began to swell over the earth.
Genesis 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month of that year, all the subterranean fountains of the great deep burst forth. At the same time, the floodgates of the sky were opened wide.
Genesis 7:12 And heavy rain fell upon the earth for forty days and forty nights without stopping.
Genesis 7:13 On that same day, Noah, and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, along with Noah's wife and his three daughters-in-law, all entered the ark.
Genesis 7:14 With them went every kind of wild animal, every kind of domestic animal, every kind of creeping creature that moves on the earth, and every kind of bird and winged creature—all of them according to their own species.
Genesis 7:15 They entered the ark with Noah, two by two, from every living creature that had the breath of life in it.
Genesis 7:16 Those that entered were male and female from every kind of living creature, just as the Lord had commanded Noah. Then the Lord himself shut the door securely behind Noah.
Genesis 7:17 The flood continued for forty days upon the earth. The waters swelled, lifting the ark high, so it was raised up from the ground.
Genesis 7:18 The waters became exceedingly mighty and covered everything on the surface of the earth. But the ark floated securely on the surface of the waters.
Genesis 7:19 The waters prevailed with extreme might over the earth. All the high mountains that were under the entire sky were completely covered by the flood.
Genesis 7:20 The water rose fifteen cubits (about twenty-two feet) above the highest mountains, completely submerging them.
Genesis 7:21 Every living creature that moved on the earth perished: all birds, all wild animals, all domestic beasts, all creeping creatures that crawled on the earth, and all mankind.
Genesis 7:22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
Genesis 7:23 God wiped out every living thing that was on the surface of the earth, from man to domestic animal, and all creeping creatures, and all birds of the sky. They were all utterly destroyed from the earth. Only Noah remained alive, along with those who were with him in the ark.
Genesis 7:24 The waters covered the earth and remained at their height for one hundred and fifty days.
Genesis 8:1 But the Lord took Noah and all the living creatures and all the cattle that were with him in the ark to heart. He sent a powerful wind across the earth, and the floodwaters began to recede.
Genesis 8:2 And the underground springs that supplied the floodwaters were closed, and the floodgates of the sky were shut. The rain from the sky was stopped.
Genesis 8:3 The waters continued to recede from the earth, constantly flowing back and forth. After one hundred and fifty days, they began to significantly diminish.
Genesis 8:4 And in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat (which are in Armenia).
Genesis 8:5 However, the waters continued to recede and diminish until the tenth month. On the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains became visible.
Genesis 8:6 And it happened that after forty days had passed, Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made, and he released a raven.
Genesis 8:7 The raven flew out and did not return to the ark, as it waited for the waters upon the earth to dry completely.
Genesis 8:8 Then Noah also sent out a dove after the raven, to see if the waters had subsided from the surface of the earth.
Genesis 8:9 But the dove could not find any place to rest its foot, because the waters still covered the entire surface of the earth. So it returned to Noah in the ark. Noah reached out his hand, took the dove, and brought it back inside the ark.
Genesis 8:10 Noah waited for seven more days, and again he released the dove from the ark.
Genesis 8:11 And the dove came back to him in the evening, carrying a fresh olive branch with green leaves in its beak. So Noah understood that the waters had finally receded from the earth.
Genesis 8:12 Noah waited for seven more days, and then he released the dove again. This time, it did not return to him.
Genesis 8:13 Therefore, in the six hundred and first year of Noah's life, in the first month, on the first day of that month, the waters had receded from the earth. Noah opened the covering of the ark, looked out, and saw that the surface of the land was dry.
Genesis 8:14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the entire earth was dry.
Genesis 8:15 Then God spoke to Noah, saying:
Genesis 8:16  'Come out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
Genesis 8:17  'Bring out with you all the living creatures that are with you, from every kind of flesh: the birds, the cattle, and all the creeping things that crawl upon the earth. Go forth onto the earth, and grow in number, and multiply upon it.' 
Genesis 8:18 So Noah went out, and his wife, and his sons, and his sons' wives with him.
Genesis 8:19 And all the living creatures, all the creeping things, and all the birds, everything that moves upon the earth, came out of the ark according to their kinds.
Genesis 8:20 Then Noah built an altar to the Lord. And taking from every clean animal and every clean bird, he offered burnt offerings on the altar.
Genesis 8:21 And the Lord smelled the pleasing aroma of the sacrifice, and He said in His heart: 'Never again will I curse the earth because of humans, for the intention and the inclination of the human heart are prone to evil from its youth. Therefore, I will never again strike down every living thing as I have done.
Genesis 8:22  'For all the days the earth endures, planting and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall never cease.' 
Genesis 9:1 God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the entire earth."
Genesis 9:2 And your powerful presence and authority shall be upon all the animals of the land, and upon all the birds of the sky, with all the creatures that move upon the earth; all the fish of the sea are now given into your control.
Genesis 9:3 Every moving, living thing will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants before the flood, I have now given you all these things to eat.
Genesis 9:4 But you shall not eat the flesh of an animal with its blood still in it, because its life is in its blood.
Genesis 9:5 For I will certainly demand an account for the blood that holds your life; I will demand it from every wild beast, and from the hand of man. Indeed, from the hand of every man and his brother, I will demand an account for the life of a human being.
Genesis 9:6 Whoever sheds human blood, his blood shall also be shed in return; for indeed, God made man in His own divine image and likeness.
Genesis 9:7 But as for you, be fruitful and multiply; spread out over the earth and fill it.
Genesis 9:8 Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons who were with him, saying:
Genesis 9:9 "Behold, I am now establishing my solemn covenant with you and with your descendants who will come after you."
Genesis 9:10 "And with every living creature that is with you—the birds, the livestock, and every wild beast of the earth that is with you—all that came out of the ark, and indeed, all the living creatures of the earth."
Genesis 9:11 "I establish my covenant with you: never again shall all living creatures be cut off by the waters of a flood; nor shall there ever again be a flood to destroy the entire earth."
Genesis 9:12 And God said, "This is the sign of my solemn covenant, which I now give between me and you, and between me and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:"
Genesis 9:13 "I will place my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant between me and the entire earth."
Genesis 9:14 "And whenever I bring clouds over the sky, my rainbow will appear in those clouds."
Genesis 9:15 "And I will remember my covenant that is between me and you, and with every living creature that possesses life; never again shall the waters of a flood destroy all living creatures."
Genesis 9:16 "So the rainbow will be in the clouds, and I will look at it and remember the everlasting covenant, which was established between God and every living creature of all flesh upon the earth."
Genesis 9:17 And God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all living creatures upon the entire earth."
Genesis 9:18 The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the one who became the father of Canaan.
Genesis 9:19 These three are the sons of Noah, and from these three, the entire earth was populated.
Genesis 9:20 Noah, a farmer, was the first to cultivate the land and he planted a vineyard.
Genesis 9:21 He drank some wine and became drunk, and was lying uncovered inside his tent.
Genesis 9:22 And when Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness, he went out and told his two brothers.
Genesis 9:23 But Shem and Japheth took a cloak, laid it on both their shoulders, and walking backward, they covered their father's nakedness. Their faces were turned away so they did not see their father's nakedness.
Genesis 9:24 When Noah awoke from his wine and learned what his younger son—Ham—had done to him,
Genesis 9:25 He said, "Cursed be Canaan! He shall be the lowest of servants to his brothers."
Genesis 9:26 Then he said, "Blessed be the Lord God of Shem! And Canaan shall be his servant."
Genesis 9:27 "May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall also be his servant."
Genesis 9:28 Noah lived for three hundred and fifty years after the great flood.
Genesis 9:29 And all the days of Noah's life were nine hundred and fifty years; then he died.
Genesis 10:1 These are the descendants of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Children were born to them after the great flood that reset humanity.
Genesis 10:2 The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Mosoch, and Thiras.
Genesis 10:3 The sons of Gomer were Aschenez, Riphath, and Thogorma.
Genesis 10:4 The sons of Javan were Elisa, Tharsis, Cetthim, and Dodanim.
Genesis 10:5 From these descendants, the peoples of the nations spread out to their own lands, each according to their language, their families, and their nations.
Genesis 10:6 The sons of Ham were Chus, Mesraim, Phuth, and Chanaan.
Genesis 10:7 The sons of Chus were Saba, Hevila, Sabatha, Regma, and Sabatacha. The sons of Regma were Saba and Dadan.
Genesis 10:8 Furthermore, Chus was the father of Nemrod. This Nemrod began to be a mighty leader on the earth.
Genesis 10:9 He was a powerful hunter, a great man in the sight of the Lord. For this reason, it became a saying: 'Like Nemrod, a powerful hunter in the sight of the Lord.'
Genesis 10:10 The beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne, in the land of Sennaar.
Genesis 10:11 From that land, Assur went forth, and he built Ninive, and its city squares, and Calach.
Genesis 10:12 He also built Resen, which is between Ninive and Calach. This is a great city.
Genesis 10:13 Indeed, Mesraim was the father of Ludim, Anamim, Laabim, and Nephthuim.
Genesis 10:14 And also Phetrusim and Casluim, from whom the Philisthiim and Caphtorim descended.
Genesis 10:15 And Chanaan was the father of Sidon, his firstborn son, and also Hethæum.
Genesis 10:16 And also the Jebusæum, Amorrhæum, and Gergesæum.
Genesis 10:17 Also the Hevæum, Aracæum, and Sinæum.
Genesis 10:18 And the Aradium, Samaræum, and Hamathæum. After this, the peoples of the Chananæans spread out.
Genesis 10:19 The territory of Chanaan extended from Sidon, going towards Gerara as far as Gaza, and then to Sodom, Gomorrham, Adama, and Seboim, reaching as far as Lesa.
Genesis 10:20 These are the descendants of Ham, organized by their family groups, languages, regions, and nations.
Genesis 10:21 And children were also born to Shem, who was the father of all the descendants of Heber, and the elder brother of Japheth.
Genesis 10:22 The sons of Shem were Ælam, Assur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
Genesis 10:23 The sons of Aram were Us, Hul, Gether, and Mes.
Genesis 10:24 Indeed, Arphaxad was the father of Sala, and from Sala, Heber was born.
Genesis 10:25 To Heber, two sons were born. The name of one was Phaleg, because in his days the peoples of the earth were divided and spread out. And his brother's name was Jectan.
Genesis 10:26 This Jectan was the father of Elmodad, Salaph, Asarmoth, and Jare.
Genesis 10:27 And Aduram, Uzal, and Decla.
Genesis 10:28 And Ebal, Abimaël, and Saba.
Genesis 10:29 And Ophir, Hevila, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Jectan.
Genesis 10:30 Their dwelling place extended from Messa, as one travels towards Sephar, a mountain in the east.
Genesis 10:31 These are the descendants of Shem, according to their family groups, languages, regions, and nations.
Genesis 10:32 These are the family groups descended from Noah, according to their peoples and nations. From these, the nations of the earth spread out and divided after the great flood.
Genesis 11:1 At that time, everyone on the whole earth spoke the same language, using the same words and expressions.
Genesis 11:2 As people migrated from the east, they discovered a vast plain in the land called Shinar and chose to settle there.
Genesis 11:3 Then people said to each other, 'Let us make bricks and burn them very thoroughly to make them strong.' They used these bricks instead of stones, and they used bitumen, a natural asphalt, as their mortar.
Genesis 11:4 They also said, 'Come, let us build a great city for ourselves, and a tower that reaches so high it seems to touch the sky. This will establish our name and legacy, preventing us from being scattered across the face of the whole world.'
Genesis 11:5 But then the Lord came down from His sublime dwelling —not because He needed to, but to observe the city and the tower that the children of Adam were building.
Genesis 11:6 And the Lord said, 'See, they are one people, and they all speak a single language. This is only the beginning of what they plan to do; they will not stop pursuing their intentions until they have achieved them through their actions.'
Genesis 11:7 Then He said, 'Come, let Us —the Holy Trinity— descend and there confuse their language, so that no one will be able to understand what his neighbor is saying.'
Genesis 11:8 And in this way, the Lord scattered them from that place across the face of the whole earth. Because of this, they stopped building the city.
Genesis 11:9 That is why the place was called Babel —meaning 'confusion'— because there the Lord confused the language of the entire world. From that place, the Lord scattered them across the face of all the regions of the earth.
Genesis 11:10 These are the descendants of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old when his son Arphaxad was born, two years after the great flood.
Genesis 11:11 After Arphaxad was born, Shem lived for another five hundred years, and during this time, he fathered other sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:12 Arphaxad lived for thirty-five years, and then he became the father of Sala.
Genesis 11:13 After Sala was born, Arphaxad lived for another three hundred and three years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:14 Sala lived for thirty years, and then he became the father of Heber.
Genesis 11:15 After Heber was born, Sala lived for another four hundred and three years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:16 Heber lived for thirty-four years, and then he became the father of Peleg.
Genesis 11:17 After Peleg was born, Heber lived for another four hundred and thirty years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:18 Peleg lived for thirty years, and then he became the father of Reu.
Genesis 11:19 After Reu was born, Peleg lived for another two hundred and nine years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:20 Reu lived for thirty-two years, and then he became the father of Serug.
Genesis 11:21 After Serug was born, Reu lived for another two hundred and seven years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:22 Serug lived for thirty years, and then he became the father of Nahor.
Genesis 11:23 After Nahor was born, Serug lived for another two hundred years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:24 Nahor lived for twenty-nine years, and then he became the father of Terah.
Genesis 11:25 After Terah was born, Nahor lived for another one hundred and nineteen years, and he fathered other sons and daughters.
Genesis 11:26 Terah lived for seventy years, and then he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Genesis 11:27 Now, these are the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.
Genesis 11:28 However, Haran died in the land where he was born, in Ur of the Chaldeans, while his father Terah was still alive.
Genesis 11:29 Abram and Nahor both took wives. Abram’s wife was named Sarai. Nahor’s wife was named Milcah, who was the daughter of Haran —meaning Milcah was also Haran's daughter, and the sister of Iscah.
Genesis 11:30 However, Sarai was infertile and unable to have children.
Genesis 11:31 So Terah gathered his son Abram, and his grandson Lot —who was Haran's son— and his daughter-in-law Sarai, who was Abram's wife. He led them out of Ur of the Chaldeans, intending to travel to the land of Canaan. But when they reached a place called Haran, they settled there instead.
Genesis 11:32 Terah lived for a total of two hundred and five years, and he died in Haran.
Genesis 12:1 The Lord said to Abram, "Go out from your country, and away from your relatives, and away from your father's household. Come instead into the land that I will show you."
Genesis 12:2 "I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing for others."
Genesis 12:3 "I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those who curse you. Through you, all the families of the earth will receive blessings."
Genesis 12:4 So Abram immediately went out just as the Lord had commanded him; Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he went out from Haran, ready to begin his journey of faith.
Genesis 12:5 Abram also took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions which they had acquired, and all the people they had gained while in Haran. They set out to go into the land of Canaan. And when they came into the land of Canaan,
Genesis 12:6 Abram passed through the land as far as the place called Shechem, to the prominent valley. At that time, the Canaanites were living in that land, presenting an initial challenge for Abram.
Genesis 12:7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, "I will give this very land to your descendants." So Abram, in an act of worship and thanksgiving, built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him.
Genesis 12:8 From there, he moved on to the mountain which was to the east of Bethel. He pitched his tent there, having the city of Bethel on his west and the city of Ai on his east. He also built another altar there to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord, continuing his journey of faith and worship.
Genesis 12:9 And Abram journeyed further, continuing to move toward the southern regions of the land.
Genesis 12:10 However, a severe famine occurred in the land where Abram was. So Abram went down into Egypt to reside there as a foreigner, for the famine in the land had become extremely severe.
Genesis 12:11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, "I know that you are a very beautiful woman."
Genesis 12:12 "When the Egyptians see you, they will surely say, 'She is his wife.' Then they will kill me to take you, but they will spare your life."
Genesis 12:13 "Please say that you are my sister, so that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared on account of your beauty."
Genesis 12:14 So when Abram had entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was exceedingly beautiful, just as Abram had feared.
Genesis 12:15 And the princes of Pharaoh saw her and praised her to Pharaoh. Then the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house, an act which would later bring divine judgment.
Genesis 12:16 And because of Sarai, Pharaoh treated Abram well. Abram received sheep, oxen, male donkeys, menservants, maidservants, and camels, enriching him greatly.
Genesis 12:17 But the Lord, in His divine intervention, struck Pharaoh and his entire household with severe plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife, revealing her true relationship to Abram.
Genesis 12:18 So Pharaoh called Abram and, angered by the deception, said, "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?"
Genesis 12:19 "Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' leading me to take her as my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take her and go, leave my land!"
Genesis 12:20 And Pharaoh gave orders to his men concerning Abram, and they escorted him out, along with his wife and all that he had acquired while in Egypt.
Genesis 13:1 So Abram went up from Egypt, with his wife and all their possessions. Lot also went with him to the southern region.
Genesis 13:2 Now Abram was very rich with gold, silver, and many livestock.
Genesis 13:3 He returned by the same route he had taken from the south, all the way to Bethel, to the place where he had first pitched his tent between Bethel and Ai.
Genesis 13:4 It was where he had built an altar earlier, and there Abram worshipped the Lord, invoking His name.
Genesis 13:5 However, Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had his own flocks, tents, and herds.
Genesis 13:6 The land could not sustain them living together, because their possessions were so many that they could not dwell in the same area.
Genesis 13:7 This led to a quarrel between Abram’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen. At that time, the Canaanites and the Perizzites also inhabited the land.
Genesis 13:8 So Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no quarreling between you and me, nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.”
Genesis 13:9 “Is not the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you choose the left, I will go to the right. If you choose the right, I will go to the left.”
Genesis 13:10 So Lot, raising his eyes, saw the entire region of the Jordan Plain, which was completely irrigated—this was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. It was like the Garden of the Lord, and like Egypt as you go toward Zoar.
Genesis 13:11 Therefore, Lot chose for himself the entire Jordan Plain, and he moved eastward, and they were separated from one another.
Genesis 13:12 Abram remained in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities near the Jordan and pitched his tents as far as Sodom.
Genesis 13:13 Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked, and they were great sinners against the Lord.
Genesis 13:14 And after Lot had separated from him, the Lord said to Abram, “Lift your eyes and look from the place where you now are, to the north, to the south, to the east, and to the west.”
Genesis 13:15 “For all the land that you see, I will give to you and to your descendants forever.”
Genesis 13:16 “And I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth. If anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your descendants will also be numbered.”
Genesis 13:17 “Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth, for I am about to give it to you.”
Genesis 13:18 So Abram moved his tent and came to dwell by the Oak of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.
Genesis 14:1 Now, it happened during the time of Amraphel, who was king of Sennaar; and Arioch, who was king of Pontus; and Chedorlaomer, who was king of the Elamites; and Tidal, who was king of nations—
Genesis 14:2 —all these kings gathered together in the Forest Valley, which is now known as the Salt Sea.
Genesis 14:3 All of these rulers came together in the Forest Valley, which is the Salt Sea.
Genesis 14:4 For twelve years, these kings from the Forest Valley had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year, they rebelled against him.
Genesis 14:5 So, in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer came with the kings who were allied with him. They attacked the Rephaim people in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim people were with them, and also the Emim people in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
Genesis 14:6 and they also attacked the Horite people in the mountains of Seir, extending all the way to the plains of Paran, which is in the wilderness.
Genesis 14:7 Then, turning back, they arrived at the spring of Misphat, which is also called Kadesh. There, they struck down all the territory of the Amalekite people, and also the Amorite people who were living in Hazazonthamar.
Genesis 14:8 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela—which is also called Zoar—marched out. They arranged their battle lines against Chedorlaomer and his allies in the Forest Valley,
Genesis 14:9 —they were facing Chedorlaomer, king of the Elamites, Tidal, king of nations, Amraphel, king of Sennaar, and Arioch, king of Pontus. It was four kings against five.
Genesis 14:10 The Forest Valley had many tar pits. So, the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and their soldiers fell into the pits. Those who remained alive ran away into the mountains.
Genesis 14:11 The victorious kings took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions of food, and then they left.
Genesis 14:12 They also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, and all his possessions from Sodom, and then they left.
Genesis 14:13 Then, one of the people who had escaped from the battle came and reported all this to Abram the Hebrew. Abram was living in the valley of Mamre the Amorite, who was a brother of Eshcol and a brother of Aner. These men, Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner, were allied with Abram.
Genesis 14:14 When Abram heard that his brother's son, Lot, had been captured, he immediately assembled his three hundred and eighteen trained servants, who had been born in his household. He then pursued the kings' army all the way to Dan.
Genesis 14:15 He divided his men into groups and attacked the enemy by night. He struck them down and pursued them all the way to Hobah, which is located to the north of Damascus.
Genesis 14:16 Abram recovered all the captured possessions. He also brought back Lot, his nephew, along with Lot's possessions, and all the women and the people who had been taken captive.
Genesis 14:17 After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the valley of Shaveh, which was known as the King's Valley.
Genesis 14:18 But then, Melchizedek, who was king of Salem, and also a priest of God Most High, came out. He brought bread and wine for Abram.
Genesis 14:19 He blessed Abram, saying, 'May Abram be blessed by God Most High, who created the universe and the earth!'
Genesis 14:20 And blessed be God Most High, who protected you and delivered your enemies into your power!' And then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the spoils he had recovered.
Genesis 14:21 Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, 'Give me the people who were rescued, but you may keep all the remaining possessions for yourself.'
Genesis 14:22 Abram replied to the king of Sodom, 'I raise my hand in an oath to the Lord God Most High, the One who possesses the universe and the earth—'
Genesis 14:23 —I will not take anything that belongs to you, not even a single thread or a sandal strap. I do this so that you cannot say, 'I am the one who made Abram rich.'
Genesis 14:24 However, I will not take anything for myself, except for the food my young men have already eaten. But as for Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, the men who came with me, they will certainly take their rightful share of the spoils.

Genesis 15:1 After these things, the Lord God spoke to Abram, appearing to him in a vision. He said: 'Do not be afraid, Abram, for I am your protector, and your reward will be exceedingly great.'
Genesis 15:2 Abram responded: 'Lord God, what can You give me? I am going on without an heir, and the one who manages my household, Eliezer of Damascus, is the only one who could inherit from me.'
Genesis 15:3 And Abram added: 'You have given me no children, and behold, a servant born in my house is now my heir.'
Genesis 15:4 Immediately, the Lord's word came to him, saying: 'This man will not be your heir. Instead, one who comes forth from your own body — he will be your heir.'
Genesis 15:5 Then God led Abram outside and said to him: 'Look up at the sky and count the stars, if you can.' And He said to him: 'So numerous will your descendants be.'
Genesis 15:6 Abram believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
Genesis 15:7 Then God said to him: 'I am the Lord, Who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land so that you may possess it.'
Genesis 15:8 But Abram said: 'Lord God, how can I know that I will possess it?'
Genesis 15:9 And the Lord responded, saying: 'Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, also a turtledove, and a young pigeon.'
Genesis 15:10 So Abram brought all these to God. He cut the animals in half down the middle and laid each half opposite the other half. But he did not cut the birds in half.
Genesis 15:11 Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
Genesis 15:12 As the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great, dreadful darkness enveloped him.
Genesis 15:13 And it was said to him: 'Know for certain that your descendants will be foreigners in a land not their own. They will be enslaved and afflicted for four hundred years.'
Genesis 15:14 'Nevertheless, I will judge the nation whom they will serve. And after this, they will come out with great possessions.'
Genesis 15:15 'But you yourself will go to your ancestors in peace, buried in a good old age.'
Genesis 15:16 'And in the fourth generation, they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete enough for them to be dispossessed.'
Genesis 15:17 So when the sun had set, and it was very dark, behold, a smoking brazier and a flaming torch appeared, passing between the halves of the divided animals.
Genesis 15:18 On that very day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying: 'To your descendants I will give this land, from the river of Egypt all the way to the great river Euphrates—'
Genesis 15:19 '—including the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,'
Genesis 15:20 '—and the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Rephaim,'
Genesis 15:21 '—and the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.'
Genesis 16:1 Sarai, Abram's wife, had not borne him any children. Now, she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.
Genesis 17:1 It came to pass that when Abraham was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said to him: “I am God Almighty. Walk and live your life in My presence, and strive for perfection.”
Genesis 17:2 I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply your descendants beyond measure.
Genesis 17:3 Abram fell down, prostrate on his face, and God continued to speak to him, saying:
Genesis 17:4 “I am He, and this is My covenant with you: you will be the father of many nations.”
Genesis 17:5 “Your name will no longer be called Abram. Instead, your name will be Abraham, because I have made you the father of many nations.”
Genesis 17:6 “I will make you incredibly fruitful, and I will make you into many nations, and kings will come forth from you.”
Genesis 17:7 “And I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and your descendants after you, throughout their generations, as an everlasting covenant: that I may be your God, and the God of your descendants after you, forever.”
Genesis 17:8 “And I will give to you and your descendants the land where you now live as an alien—all the land of Canaan—as an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.”
Genesis 17:9 God also said to Abraham: “You, therefore, shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.”
Genesis 17:10 “This is My covenant, which you shall observe, between Me and you, and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised.”
Genesis 17:11 “You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it will be a visible sign of the covenant between Me and you.”
Genesis 17:12 “Every male among you, in your generations, shall be circumcised when he is eight days old, including those born in your household and those bought with money, who are not of your direct lineage.”
Genesis 17:13 “Both those born in your household and those bought with money must be circumcised. My covenant will be visibly marked in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.”
Genesis 17:14 “Any uncircumcised male, whose foreskin has not been circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people, because he has broken My covenant and rendered it null and void.”
Genesis 17:15 God also said to Abraham: “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her Sarai; rather, her name shall be Sarah.”
Genesis 17:16 “I will bless her, and indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will become the mother of nations, and kings of peoples will be born from her.”
Genesis 17:17 Abraham fell on his face and laughed within his heart, saying to himself: “Will a son indeed be born to a man who is a hundred years old? And will Sarah, who is ninety years old, actually give birth?”
Genesis 17:18 And Abraham said to God: “Oh, that Ishmael might live and thrive in Your presence!”
Genesis 17:19 Then God said: “No, truly, Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac. I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant, and with his descendants after him.”
Genesis 17:20 “And concerning Ishmael, I have also heard your prayer. Behold, I will bless him, and I will make him fruitful, and I will multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation.”
Genesis 17:21 “But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this appointed time, in the coming year.”
Genesis 17:22 When God had finished speaking with Abraham, He then ascended from him.
Genesis 17:23 So Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all those born in his household, and all those whom he had bought—every male among the men of his household—and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins immediately on that very day, just as God had commanded him.
Genesis 17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin.
Genesis 17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised.
Genesis 17:26 On that very same day, Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son with him.
Genesis 17:27 And all the men of his household—both those born in his house, and those bought with money, and even foreigners living among them—were circumcised with him at the same time.
Genesis 18:1 The Lord then appeared to him in the valley of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent during the hottest part of the day.
Genesis 18:2 And when he lifted his eyes, three men stood near him. When he saw them, he ran from the door of his tent to meet them, and bowed down to the ground.
Genesis 18:3 And he said: "My Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant."
Genesis 18:4 Let me bring a little water, and you may wash your feet and then rest yourselves under this tree.
Genesis 18:5 And I will bring a piece of bread, so you can refresh yourselves. After that, you may continue on your way, because that is why you have turned aside to your servant." And they said: "Do as you have spoken."
Genesis 18:6 Abraham hurried to his tent to Sarah, and said to her: "Quickly, take three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make flat bread."
Genesis 18:7 And he himself ran to the herd and took from there a very tender and choice calf, and gave it to a young man, who quickly prepared and cooked it.
Genesis 18:8 He also brought butter and milk, and the calf which he had prepared, and set them before them. But he himself stood by them under the tree.
Genesis 18:9 And when they had eaten, they said to him: "Where is Sarah your wife?" He responded: "Behold, she is in the tent."
Genesis 18:10 And one of them said to him: "I will surely return to you at this time next year, if life continues as it is, and your wife Sarah will have a son." When Sarah heard this, she laughed to herself behind the door of the tent.
Genesis 18:11 Now both Abraham and Sarah were old and advanced in age, and Sarah had ceased to have the monthly custom of women.
Genesis 18:12 So Sarah laughed to herself, saying: "After I have become old, and my master is also old, shall I indeed have pleasure, or bear a child?"
Genesis 18:13 And the Lord said to Abraham: "Why did Sarah laugh, saying: 'Shall I truly bear a child, being an old woman?'"
Genesis 18:14 Is anything too difficult for God? I will return at the same time next year, if life continues as it is, and Sarah will have a son.
Genesis 18:15 Sarah denied it, saying: "I did not laugh," because she was terrified. The Lord said: "It is not so; but you did laugh."
Genesis 18:16 Then, when the men rose from there, they looked toward Sodom. And Abraham walked with them, accompanying them on their way.
Genesis 18:17 And the Lord said: "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?"
Genesis 18:18 For Abraham will surely become a great and very powerful nation, and in him, all the nations of the earth will be blessed.
Genesis 18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord and to do righteousness and justice, so that the Lord may bring upon Abraham everything He has spoken to him.
Genesis 18:20 Therefore, the Lord said: "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah has greatly increased, and their sin has become exceedingly grievous."
Genesis 18:21 I will go down and see if they have indeed carried out the full measure of the outcry that has come to me, or if it is not so; so that I may know with certainty.
Genesis 18:22 So the men turned away from there and went toward Sodom. But Abraham still stood before the Lord.
Genesis 18:23 And Abraham approached and said: "Will you truly destroy the righteous along with the wicked?"
Genesis 18:24 If there are perhaps fifty righteous people in the city, will you destroy them? And will you not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people who are in it?
Genesis 18:25 Far be it from you to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous are treated like the wicked. Far be it from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?
Genesis 18:26 And the Lord said: "If I find fifty righteous people in Sodom within the city, I will spare the entire place for their sake."
Genesis 18:27 And Abraham responded and said: "Behold, I have dared to speak to my Lord, though I am but dust and ashes."
Genesis 18:28 What if there are five fewer than fifty righteous people? Will you destroy the entire city because of those five?" And He said: "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."
Genesis 18:29 And he spoke to Him again: "What if forty righteous people are found there?" He said: "I will not strike it for the sake of the forty."
Genesis 18:30 Then he said: "Please, Lord, do not be angry if I speak again: what if thirty righteous people are found there?" He answered: "I will not do it if I find thirty there."
Genesis 18:31 And he said: "Since I have begun, I will speak to my Lord again: what if twenty righteous people are found there?" He said: "I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty."
Genesis 18:32 Then he said: "I beg you, Lord, do not be angry if I speak just one more time: what if ten righteous people are found there?" He answered: "I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten."
Genesis 18:33 And the Lord departed after He had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his own place.
Genesis 19:1 Two angels arrived in the city of Sodom in the evening. Lot was sitting at the city gate, where people conducted legal and civic matters. When he saw them, he stood up and went out to meet them, bowing down with his face to the ground as a sign of deep respect and humility.
Genesis 19:2 And Lot said, 'Please, sirs, come to your servant's house and stay the night there. You can wash your feet, and then depart on your journey in the morning.' But they replied, 'No, we will stay in the public square.'
Genesis 19:3 But Lot urged them strongly, so they turned aside and entered his house. He prepared a feast for them, baking unleavened bread, and they ate.
Genesis 19:4 Before they lay down to sleep, the men of the city of Sodom surrounded the house—every single person, from the youngest boy to the oldest man.
Genesis 19:5 They called out to Lot and said to him, 'Where are the men who came to your house tonight? Bring them out to us, so that we may know them intimately in a sinful way.'
Genesis 19:6 Lot went out to them, closing the door behind him, and said,
Genesis 19:7 'Please, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.'
Genesis 19:8 'Look, I have two virgin daughters. I will bring them out to you, and you may do to them whatever you please. But do nothing to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.'
Genesis 19:9 But they shouted back, 'Stand back!' And again they said, 'You came here as a foreigner, and now you want to judge us? We will treat you worse than we will treat them!' And they pressed violently against Lot, and were already close to breaking down the door.
Genesis 19:10 Then the men inside (the angels) stretched out their hands, pulled Lot back into the house, and shut the door.
Genesis 19:11 And they struck the men outside with blindness, from the youngest to the oldest, so that they could not find the door anymore.
Genesis 19:12 Then the angels said to Lot, 'Do you have anyone else here who belongs to you? Your son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and everyone else who is yours—bring them out of this city.'
Genesis 19:13 'For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown so great before the Lord, who has sent us to destroy them.'
Genesis 19:14 So Lot went out and spoke to his future sons-in-law, who were going to marry his daughters. He said, 'Get up, get out of this place, because the Lord is about to destroy this city.' But he seemed to them to be joking.
Genesis 19:15 When the dawn was breaking, the angels urged Lot, saying, 'Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here with you, so that you do not perish along with the city in its wickedness.'
Genesis 19:16 When Lot hesitated, the angels grasped his hand, his wife's hand, and the hands of his two daughters, because the Lord had mercy on him. They led him out and placed him outside the city.
Genesis 19:17 When they had led them outside, one of the angels said, 'Escape for your life! Do not look back behind you, and do not stop anywhere in the surrounding plain. Escape to the mountains, so that you do not perish along with everyone else!'
Genesis 19:18 And Lot said to them, 'Oh no, my Lord, please do not make me do that!'
Genesis 19:19 'Look, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown great mercy to me by saving my life. But I cannot escape to the mountains, for fear that some evil might overtake me there, and I will die.'
Genesis 19:20 'See, there is this nearby town to which I can flee, and it is a small one. Please, let me escape there so that my life may be saved, for it is indeed a very small town.'
Genesis 19:21 And the angel said to him, 'See, I have granted your request in this matter as well, that I will not overthrow the town for which you have pleaded.'
Genesis 19:22 'Hurry and escape there, because I can do nothing until you arrive there.' That is why the name of that city was called Zoar, meaning 'small.'
Genesis 19:23 The sun had risen over the earth when Lot entered Zoar.
Genesis 19:24 Then the Lord rained down sulfur and fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah—from the Lord, out of the sky.
Genesis 19:25 And He overthrew those cities, and all the surrounding plain, along with all the inhabitants of the cities, and every living thing growing on the ground.
Genesis 19:26 But Lot's wife looked back behind him, and she was turned into a pillar of salt.
Genesis 19:27 But Abraham, rising early in the morning, went to the place where he had previously stood before the Lord.
Genesis 19:28 And he looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and across the entire land of that region. He saw smoke ascending from the earth, like the smoke from a furnace.
Genesis 19:29 When God overthrew the cities of that region, He remembered Abraham, and rescued Lot from the destruction of the cities where he had lived.
Genesis 19:30 Then Lot went up out of Zoar and settled in the mountains, with his two daughters, because he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He lived in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.
Genesis 19:31 And the older daughter said to the younger, 'Our father is old, and there is no man left in this land to come in to us according to the custom of all the earth, to take us as wives and have children with us.'
Genesis 19:32 'Come, let us make our father drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father.'
Genesis 19:33 So they gave their father wine to drink that night. Then the older daughter went in and lay with her father, but he did not know when she lay down or when she got up.
Genesis 19:34 The next day, the older daughter said to the younger, 'See, I lay with my father last night. Let us make him drunk with wine tonight as well, and you go in and lie with him, so that we may preserve offspring through our father.'
Genesis 19:35 So they gave their father wine to drink that night also. And the younger daughter went in and lay with him, but he also did not know when she lay down or when she got up.
Genesis 19:36 Thus, Lot's two daughters conceived children by their father.
Genesis 19:37 The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the ancestor of the Moabites to this very day.
Genesis 19:38 The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi, which means 'son of my people.' He is the ancestor of the Ammonites to this very day.

Genesis 19:40 null
Genesis 20:1 Abraham then departed from that place and journeyed into the land to the south. He settled between Kadesh and Shur, and then lived for a time as a foreign visitor in Gerar.
Genesis 20:2 He said about Sarah, his wife, 'She is my sister.' So Abimelech, the king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her for himself.
Genesis 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream during the night and said to him, 'Indeed, you will certainly die because of the woman you have taken, for she is already married to another man.'
Genesis 20:4 But Abimelech had not had relations with her, and he said, 'Lord, will You destroy an innocent and righteous people?'
Genesis 20:5 Did he not himself tell me, 'She is my sister,' and did she herself not say, 'He is my brother'? I did this with a sincere heart and clean hands, believing them.
Genesis 20:6 And God said to him, 'Yes, I also know that you acted with a sincere heart, and therefore I prevented you from committing this sin against Me. I did not permit you to have relations with her.'
Genesis 20:7 Now, therefore, restore the man's wife — Abraham's wife — because he is a prophet of God, and he will intercede for you, and your life will be spared. But if you are unwilling to return her, know that you yourself will certainly die, along with everyone and everything belonging to you.
Genesis 20:8 Immediately, Abimelech got up in the night and called all his servants. He related everything that had been said to them, and all the people became very fearful.
Genesis 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, 'What is this that you have done to us? What offense have we committed against you that you would bring such a great sin upon me and my kingdom? You have done deeds to us that should never have been done.'
Genesis 20:10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, 'What possible reason did you have for doing this?'
Genesis 20:11 Abraham answered, 'I was afraid, thinking to myself, 'Perhaps there is no reverence for God in this place, and they would kill me to take my wife.''
Genesis 20:12 Moreover, she is truly my sister; she is my father's daughter, though not my mother's, and I married her.
Genesis 20:13 When God called me to leave my father's house, I said to her, 'Do this favor for me: in every place we go, you must say, 'He is my brother.''
Genesis 20:14 So Abimelech took flocks and herds, male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham; and he gave back Sarah, his wife, to him.
Genesis 20:15 And Abimelech said, 'Look, my land is at your disposal; live wherever you wish.'
Genesis 20:16 And to Sarah he also said, 'Look, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your brother. Let this be a public vindication for you among all who witnessed this, and wherever you go, let it be a reminder of what happened.'
Genesis 20:17 So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants so that they were able to conceive children.
Genesis 20:18 For the Lord had indeed sealed every womb in Abimelech's household because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
Genesis 21:1 The Lord had remembered Sarah, just as He promised. And He brought to pass everything He had spoken.
Genesis 21:2 And she conceived and gave birth to a son in her old age, at the very time God had predicted to her.
Genesis 21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sarah had borne to him, Isaac.
Genesis 21:4 And he circumcised Isaac on the eighth day, just as God had commanded him.
Genesis 21:5 Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
Genesis 21:6 And Sarah said, "God has given me a reason to laugh! Everyone who hears about this will laugh with me."
Genesis 21:7 And again she said, "Who would have believed Abraham when he said that Sarah would nurse a child, and that she would give birth to him in her old age?"
Genesis 21:8 So the boy grew, and he was weaned from his mother's milk. And Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning.
Genesis 21:9 But when Sarah saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian woman, making fun of Isaac her son,
Genesis 21:10 she said to Abraham, "Cast out this slave-woman and her son, for the son of this slave-woman shall not inherit along with my son Isaac."
Genesis 21:11 This matter seemed very difficult to Abraham because it involved his son.
Genesis 21:12 But God said to him, "Do not let this seem harsh to you concerning the boy and your slave-woman. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice, for in Isaac your lineage will be called forth."
Genesis 21:13 But I will also make the son of the slave-woman into a great nation, because he is your descendant too.
Genesis 21:14 So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and put them on her shoulder, and he sent the boy with her. Then he sent her away. And when she had gone, she wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
Genesis 21:15 And when the water in the bottle was used up, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.
Genesis 21:16 Then she went and sat down opposite him, as far away as an arrow can be shot. For she said, "I will not see the boy die." And as she sat opposite him, she lifted her voice and wept.
Genesis 21:17 Now God heard the voice of the boy. And the Angel of God called to Hagar from the sky, saying, "What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy from the place where he is."
Genesis 21:18 Rise, take the boy, and hold his hand, for I will make him into a great nation.
Genesis 21:19 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of living water. So she went and filled the bottle and gave the boy to drink.
Genesis 21:20 And God was with him, and he grew, and he lived in the wilderness, becoming a young archer.
Genesis 21:21 And he lived in the desert of Paran, and his mother found him a wife from the land of Egypt.
Genesis 21:22 At that same time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all that you do."
Genesis 21:23 Therefore, swear to me now by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my descendants, nor with my lineage. But according to the kindness I have shown to you, you will show kindness to me and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.
Genesis 21:24 And Abraham said, "I will swear."
Genesis 21:25 Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water which Abimelech's servants had taken by force.
Genesis 21:26 And Abimelech answered, "I do not know who did this. You did not tell me anything, and I did not hear of it until today."
Genesis 21:27 So Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech. And both of them made a covenant.
Genesis 21:28 And Abraham set aside seven ewe-lambs from the flock.
Genesis 21:29 And Abimelech said to him, "What do these seven ewe-lambs mean, which you have set aside?"
Genesis 21:30 And he said, "You shall accept these seven ewe-lambs from my hand, that they may be a witness for me that I dug this well."
Genesis 21:31 Because of this reason, that place was called Beersheba, which means 'well of the oath', because there both of them swore an oath.
Genesis 21:32 So they made a covenant in Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
Genesis 21:33 And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.
Genesis 21:34 And he sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.
Genesis 22:1 After these things had happened, God put Abraham to the test. God said to him, 'Abraham! Abraham!' Abraham answered, 'Here I am.'
Genesis 22:2 God said, 'Take your son, your only son, Isaac—the son whom you love—and go to the land of vision. There, offer him as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains that I will show you.'
Genesis 22:3 So, Abraham got up before dawn and saddled his donkey. He took two of his servants with him, and his son Isaac. Abraham cut the wood for the burnt offering and then set off for the place God had told him about.
Genesis 22:4 On the third day of their journey, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
Genesis 22:5 Abraham told his servants, 'You two stay here with the donkey. My son and I will go up to the mountain to worship, and then we will come back to you.' —This implies Abraham's faith that Isaac would be returned to him.
Genesis 22:6 Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it upon his son Isaac’s shoulders. Abraham himself carried the fire and the knife in his hands. And so, the two of them walked on together.
Genesis 22:7 Isaac spoke to his father Abraham, saying, 'My father!' Abraham answered, 'What is it, my son?' Isaac said, 'Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?'
Genesis 22:8 Abraham replied, 'My son, God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering.' And so, the two of them walked on together.
Genesis 22:9 When they arrived at the place God had shown him, Abraham built an altar there. He arranged the wood upon it. Then, Abraham bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood.
Genesis 22:10 Abraham then reached out his hand and took the knife, ready to sacrifice his son.
Genesis 22:11 But behold, an angel of the Lord called to him from the sky, saying, 'Abraham! Abraham!' Abraham answered, 'Here I am!'
Genesis 22:12 The angel said, 'Do not lay a hand on the boy, and do not do anything to him! Now I know that you truly revere God, for you did not withhold your only son from Me.'
Genesis 22:13 Abraham looked up and saw a ram behind him, caught by its horns in a thicket. So Abraham took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
Genesis 22:14 Abraham called the name of that place, 'The Lord Will Provide.' —Using the prophetic sense of 'sees'. That is why, to this day, people say, 'On the mountain, the Lord will provide.'
Genesis 22:15 Then the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from the sky,
Genesis 22:16 saying, 'By Myself I have sworn, declares the Lord. Because you have done this and have not withheld your only son—'
Genesis 22:17 '—I will surely bless you and multiply your descendants as countless as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies.'
Genesis 22:18 'Through your offspring, all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.'
Genesis 22:19 Then Abraham returned to his servants, and together they went to Beersheba. And Abraham settled there.
Genesis 22:20 After these events, Abraham received a message, saying, 'Listen! Your brother Nahor’s wife, Milcah, has also given birth to sons!'
Genesis 22:21 These are their names: Huz, his firstborn, Buz, his brother, and Kemuel, who became the father of the Aramean people.
Genesis 22:22 Also Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel. It was from Bethuel that Rebekah was born.
Genesis 22:23 These eight sons Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
Genesis 22:24 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore children: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
Genesis 23:1 And Sarah lived for one hundred and twenty-seven years.
Genesis 23:2 And she died in the city of Arbee, which is Hebron in the land of Canaan. So Abraham came to mourn and to weep for her.
Genesis 23:3 After Abraham had finished with his duties concerning the deceased, he spoke to the sons of Heth, saying:
Genesis 23:4 “I am a foreigner and a sojourner among you. Grant me a place to bury my dead among you, so that I can bury my deceased wife.”
Genesis 23:5 And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying:
Genesis 23:6 “Listen to us, my lord. You are a mighty leader sent by God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our burial places. No one among us will refuse you from burying your dead in his own burial place.”
Genesis 23:7 Abraham then stood up and bowed down respectfully before the people of the land, that is, the sons of Heth.
Genesis 23:8 And he spoke to them, saying, “If you are truly willing for me to bury my dead, then hear me and intercede for me with Ephron, the son of Zohar.”
Genesis 23:9 “Tell him to give me the double-chambered cave that he owns at the far end of his field. He must sell it to me for its full price in silver, in your presence, so that I may possess it as a burial place.”
Genesis 23:10 Now Ephron was dwelling among the sons of Heth. And Ephron answered Abraham in the hearing of all those who were entering the gate of his city, saying:
Genesis 23:11 “By no means, my lord! I give you the field itself, and the cave which is in it, freely to you. In the presence of the sons of my people, you may bury your dead.”
Genesis 23:12 Abraham then bowed down before the people of the land.
Genesis 23:13 And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “I beg you, hear me! I will give you money for the field. Accept it from me, and so I may bury my dead there with you.”
Genesis 23:14 And Ephron answered him:
Genesis 23:15 “My lord, hear me. The land is valued at one hundred talents of silver. What is that amount between you and me? Just bury your dead.”
Genesis 23:16 When Abraham heard this, he weighed out the money that Ephron had demanded: one hundred shekels of silver, according to the standard public weight.
Genesis 23:17 And so, Ephron's field, which contained the double-chambered cave facing Mamre, was legally transferred. Both the field itself, the cave, and all the trees within its boundaries, were legally confirmed.
Genesis 23:18 It was transferred to Abraham as a permanent possession, witnessed by the sons of Heth and all who entered the gate of that city.
Genesis 23:19 And so Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the double-chambered cave of the field that faced Mamre, which is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 23:20 And the field, along with the cave within it, was legally confirmed to Abraham by the sons of Heth as a permanent burial possession.
Genesis 24:1 Abraham was now very old and had lived many years, and the Lord had blessed him in everything he did and possessed.
Genesis 24:2 He said to his senior servant, the one in charge of his entire household, and who managed all of Abraham's possessions:
Genesis 24:3 He said to him, 'Swear an oath by the Lord, the God of the universe and the earth, that you will not choose a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I now live.
Genesis 24:4 Instead, you must go to my own country and to my own relatives, and there you will find a wife for my son, Isaac.'
Genesis 24:5 The servant replied, 'But what if the woman is unwilling to follow me back to this land? Must I then take your son back to the land you came from?'
Genesis 24:6 Abraham responded, 'Under no circumstances are you to take my son back there!'
Genesis 24:7 The Lord, the God of the universe, who took me from my father's house and from the land where I was born—He is the one who spoke to me and swore an oath, saying: 'I will give this land to your descendants.'
Genesis 24:8 He himself will send His angel ahead of you, and you will successfully find a wife there for my son.
Genesis 24:9 However, if the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you will be released from this oath. Just do not take my son back to that place.'
Genesis 24:10 So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham, his master, and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
Genesis 24:11 Then the servant took ten camels from his master's herd and brought with him a selection of his master's finest goods. He then set out for Mesopotamia, traveling toward the city of Nahor.
Genesis 24:12 When he had finished praying, he said: 'Lord, God of my master Abraham, I beg you, grant me success today, and show covenant faithfulness to my master Abraham.'
Genesis 24:13 'Look, I am standing here beside this well of water, and the daughters of the city's inhabitants will soon come out to draw water.'
Genesis 24:14 'May it be that the young woman to whom I say, "Please lower your jar so I can drink," and who then replies, "Drink, and I will also water your camels"—that she is the one you have prepared for your servant Isaac. By this sign, I will know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.'
Genesis 24:15 He had barely finished speaking when, behold, Rebekah appeared. She was the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, who was the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother. She carried a water jar on her shoulder.
Genesis 24:16 The young woman was exceptionally beautiful, a pure virgin, and no man had ever been with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and then started to come back up.
Genesis 24:17 The servant hurried to meet her and said: 'Please, let me drink a little water from your jar.'
Genesis 24:18 She immediately replied, 'Drink, my lord.' She quickly lowered her jar to her arm and gave him a drink.
Genesis 24:19 After he had finished drinking, she said: 'I will also draw water for your camels until they have all had enough to drink.'
Genesis 24:20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the watering trough, and then ran back to the well to draw more water, and she continued drawing for all his camels.
Genesis 24:21 The man watched her in silence, wanting to know if the Lord had truly made his journey successful, or not.
Genesis 24:22 After the camels had finished drinking, the man took out two gold nose rings, together weighing two shekels, and two gold bracelets, weighing ten shekels.
Genesis 24:23 Then he asked her, 'Whose daughter are you? Please tell me: Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?'
Genesis 24:24 She answered, 'I am the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.'
Genesis 24:25 She added, saying: 'We have plenty of straw and fodder, and also space for you to spend the night.'
Genesis 24:26 The man bowed his head and worshipped the Lord,
Genesis 24:27 saying: 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His covenant faithfulness and His truth from my master. He has led me directly to the house of my master's brother!'
Genesis 24:28 So the young woman ran off and reported everything she had heard in her mother's household.
Genesis 24:29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he quickly rushed out to the man at the spring.
Genesis 24:30 When he saw the nose rings and bracelets on his sister's hands, and heard all the words she recounted, he came to the man who was still standing by the camels, near the water spring.
Genesis 24:31 And he said, 'Come in, blessed of the Lord! Why are you standing outside? I have prepared the house, and a place for your camels.'
Genesis 24:32 So Laban brought the man into the house. He then unloaded the camels, gave straw and fodder to the camels, and provided water for washing his feet and the feet of the men who had come with him.
Genesis 24:33 When food was set before him, he said, 'I will not eat until I have spoken my message.' Laban replied to him, 'Speak.'
Genesis 24:34 Then he said, 'I am Abraham's servant.'
Genesis 24:35 And the Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become very prosperous. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, camels and donkeys.
Genesis 24:36 And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master, even after she was already old. My master has given everything he owns to that son.
Genesis 24:37 My master made me swear an oath, saying: 'You must not choose a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I am living;'
Genesis 24:38 'but you are to go to my father's house, and choose a wife for my son from among my relatives.'
Genesis 24:39 And I said to my master, 'What if the woman is unwilling to come with me?'
Genesis 24:40 He replied, 'The Lord, in whose presence I live and walk, will send His angel with you and will make your journey successful. And you will find a wife for my son from my own relatives and from my father's household.'
Genesis 25:1 Abraham, for his part, married again, and took a wife named Keturah.
Genesis 25:2 She bore for him Zamran, Jecsan, Madan, Madian, Jesboc, and Sue.
Genesis 25:3 Jecsan, for his part, begot Saba and Dadan. The sons of Dadan were Rassum, Lugum, and Lemin.
Genesis 25:4 Furthermore, the sons of Madian were Epha, Opher, Henoch, Abida, and Eldaa. All these were descendants through Keturah.
Genesis 25:5 And Abraham gave all that he possessed to Isaac.
Genesis 25:6 But to the sons of his concubines, he gave gifts, and he separated them from Isaac, his son, while he was still living, sending them toward the eastern region.
Genesis 25:7 Now the days of Abraham's life, which he lived, were one hundred seventy-five years.
Genesis 25:8 And being fully aged, he died in a good old age, full of days, and was gathered to his people.
Genesis 25:9 And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which is situated opposite Mamre, in the field of Ephron, the son of Seor the Hethite.
Genesis 25:10 Abraham had purchased this cave from the sons of Heth: there he was buried, and Sarah his wife.
Genesis 25:11 And after his death, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac then lived near the Well of Vision.
Genesis 25:12 These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore to Abraham.
Genesis 25:13 And these are the names of Ishmael's sons, according to their names and their generations: Ishmael’s firstborn was Nabajoth, then Cedar, Adbeel, Masma,
Genesis 25:14 and Massa, and Iduma, and Massa (this is a repeated name or variant spelling in the text),
Genesis 25:15 and Badad, and Thema, and Jetur, and Naphis, and Cedma.
Genesis 25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their towns and their encampments—twelve princes of their tribes.
Genesis 25:17 And the years of Ishmael’s life were one hundred thirty-seven. He then weakened, died, and was gathered to his people.
Genesis 25:18 From Havila to Hemath, as far as one comes to Sur, which faces Egypt as one journeys towards the Assyrians—he died in the presence of all his brethren.
Genesis 25:19 These also are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot Isaac.
Genesis 25:20 When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebecca, the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian from Mesopotamia, the sister of Laban the Syrian.
Genesis 25:21 Isaac then implored the Lord for his wife, because she was barren. The Lord heard him, and Rebecca, his wife, conceived.
Genesis 25:22 But the children struggled violently within her womb. She said, “If this is how it will be for me, why was it necessary to conceive?” And she went to consult the Lord.
Genesis 25:23 And the Lord responded: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be divided from your body. One people will overcome the other people, and the older will serve the younger.”
Genesis 25:24 When the time for her to give birth arrived, behold, there were twins in her womb.
Genesis 25:25 The first one who came out was reddish, and entirely hairy like a cloak. And his name was called Esau.
Genesis 25:26 After him came his brother, whose hand grasped Esau’s heel. And therefore, his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born to him.
Genesis 25:27 Now the boys grew up. Esau became a skilled hunter, a man of the field. Jacob, however, was a simple man, dwelling in tents.
Genesis 25:28 Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his game. And Rebecca loved Jacob.
Genesis 25:29 Now Jacob cooked a stew. And when Esau came in from the field, weary,
Genesis 25:30 he said, “Give me some of that red dish, for I am extremely famished.” For this reason, his name was called Edom (meaning 'red').
Genesis 25:31 To him Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright first.”
Genesis 25:32 He replied, “Look, I am about to die. What good will a birthright be to me?”
Genesis 25:33 And Jacob said, “Swear to me then.” Esau swore, and sold his birthright to Jacob.
Genesis 25:34 And so, Jacob gave him bread and the lentil stew. Esau ate, and drank, and rose up, and went away, showing little regard for having sold his birthright.
Genesis 25:35 Now a famine occurred in the land, following the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, in Gerar.
Genesis 25:36 And the Lord appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt, but remain in the land which I will tell you about.
Genesis 25:37 Journey as a stranger in this land, and I will be with you, and I will bless you. For to you and to your offspring I will give all these regions, fulfilling the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.
Genesis 25:38 And I will multiply your offspring like the stars of the sky. And I will give all these regions to your descendants. And all the nations of the earth will be blessed through your offspring,
Genesis 25:39 because Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My precepts and My commandments, and observed My ceremonies and rituals.”
Genesis 25:40 So Isaac remained in Gerar.
Genesis 26:1 Now there was a famine in the land—a new one, after the previous famine that had happened during the time of Abraham. And so Isaac went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, in Gerar.
Genesis 26:2 And the Lord appeared to Isaac, saying: 'Do not go down to Egypt; instead, stay in the land that I will show you.'
Genesis 26:3 Live as a temporary resident in this land, and I will be with you, and I will bless you. For to you and to your descendants, I will give all these lands, fulfilling the oath that I swore to Abraham, your father.
Genesis 26:4 And I will multiply your descendants, making them as numerous as the stars of the sky. And I will give all these lands to your descendants. And through your offspring, all the nations of the earth will be blessed,
Genesis 26:5 because Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My commands and My ordinances, and observed My ceremonies and rituals.
Genesis 26:6 So Isaac remained in Gerar.
Genesis 26:7 When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he replied, 'She is my sister.' For he was afraid to admit that she was his wife by marriage, thinking that they might kill him because of her great beauty.
Genesis 26:8 After many days had passed, and while he was living there, Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, looked out through a window and saw Isaac caressing Rebecca, his wife.
Genesis 26:9 And calling Isaac, he said to him: 'It is clear that she is your wife. Why did you lie, saying she was your sister?' Isaac replied, 'I was afraid that I might die because of her.'
Genesis 26:10 And Abimelech said: 'What is this that you have done to us? Any one of my people could have slept with your wife, and you would have brought great guilt upon us.'
Genesis 26:11 And he commanded all his people, saying: 'Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.'
Genesis 26:12 Now Isaac sowed seed in that land, and in that same year, he harvested a hundredfold. And the Lord blessed him abundantly.
Genesis 26:13 And the man became great, and he continued to prosper and grow, until he became very wealthy and powerful.
Genesis 26:14 For he possessed many flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle, and a large household of servants. Therefore, the Philistines envied him.
Genesis 26:15 All the wells that the servants of his father, Abraham, had dug, Abimelech had stopped up by filling them with earth.
Genesis 26:16 Finally, he warned Isaac himself to leave his territory, saying: 'Go away from us, for you have become much too powerful for us.'
Genesis 26:17 So Isaac moved away from there, and after setting up his tents in the valley of Gerar, he lived there.
Genesis 26:18 He again dug out the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, and which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham's death. And he called them by the same names that his father had called them before.
Genesis 26:19 And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and they found a well of flowing water.
Genesis 26:20 But even there, the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, 'The water is ours!' Therefore, he named that well 'Quarrel', because they had disputed with him there.
Genesis 26:21 They also dug another well, and they quarreled over that one as well. So he named it 'Enmity'.
Genesis 26:22 Moving on from there, he dug another well, and for this one, there was no contention. Therefore, he named it 'Broad Places', saying: 'Now the Lord has made room for us, and given us a spacious place, so that we may flourish and increase in the land.'
Genesis 26:23 From that place, he went up to Beersheba.
Genesis 26:24 And the Lord appeared to him on that very night, saying: 'I am the God of Abraham, your father. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of Abraham, My servant.'
Genesis 26:25 So he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord. Then he pitched his tent there, and his servants dug a well.
Genesis 26:26 And Abimelech came to him from Gerar, along with Ahuzzath, his friend, and Phicol, the commander of his army.
Genesis 26:27 And Isaac said to them: 'Why have you come to me, a man whom you hated, and whom you drove away from among you?'
Genesis 26:28 They replied: 'We clearly saw that the Lord is with you, and therefore we said to ourselves: "Let there now be an oath between us and you, and let us make a covenant together," – an agreement of peace.'
Genesis 26:29 'that you will do us no harm, just as we intended no harm against you. Instead, we sent you away in peace, because you were greatly blessed by the Lord.'
Genesis 26:30 So Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
Genesis 26:31 And rising early in the morning, they swore an oath to one another. Then Isaac sent them away, and they returned to their own land.
Genesis 26:32 On that very same day, Isaac's servants came to tell him about the well they had dug, saying, 'We have found water!'
Genesis 26:33 And he called it 'Abundance'. Therefore, the city was called Beersheba from that name, even to this present day.
Genesis 26:34 Now when Esau was forty years old, he took wives: Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
Genesis 26:35 Both of whom caused bitterness and sorrow to the spirit of Isaac and Rebecca.
Genesis 27:1 Now it came to pass, when Isaac had become old and his eyes had grown so dim that he could no longer see, he called Esau, his firstborn son, and said to him: 'My son.'
Genesis 27:2 Esau answered: 'Here I am.' Isaac then said: 'Look, I am now an old man, and I do not know the day of my death.'
Genesis 27:3 Therefore, take your hunting weapons—your quiver and your bow—and go out into the field. When you catch something by hunting,
Genesis 27:4 make me a stew from it, just as you know I like it, and bring it to me, so I may eat. After that, my soul will bless you before I die.
Genesis 27:5 Rebecca, however, had overheard when Isaac spoke to Esau, his son. So when Esau had gone out into the field to hunt and bring back what he had caught,
Genesis 27:6 Rebecca said to Jacob, her son: 'I heard your father speaking with your brother Esau, saying:'
Genesis 27:7 'Bring me some of your game, and make me a meal so I may eat it, and then I will bless you before the Lord before I die.'
Genesis 27:8 'Now therefore, my son, listen to my counsel, which I am commanding you to follow.'
Genesis 27:9 'Go to the flock and bring me two of the best young goats, so I may prepare a meal from them for your father, the kind he enjoys eating.'
Genesis 27:10 'When you bring them in and he eats them, he will bless you before he dies.'
Genesis 27:11 Jacob answered her: 'You know my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I have smooth skin.'
Genesis 27:12 'If my father touches me and feels my skin, I am afraid he will think I am trying to deceive him, and then I will bring a curse upon myself instead of a blessing.'
Genesis 27:13 His mother said to him: 'Upon me be that curse, my son. Only listen to my voice and go and bring what I have told you.'
Genesis 27:14 So he went and brought them and gave them to his mother. She then prepared the food, just as she knew his father liked it.
Genesis 27:15 Then she dressed Jacob in Esau's best clothes, which she kept with her in the house. She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the skins of the young goats.
Genesis 27:16 She said to him: 'Bring this to your father, so that when he eats, he may bless you.'
Genesis 27:17 So he brought it to his father. When Isaac had eaten, he said: 'Who are you, my son?'
Genesis 27:18 Jacob answered: 'I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you commanded me. Rise up, sit down, and eat of my game, so that your soul may bless me.'
Genesis 27:19 Isaac said: 'How is it, my son, that you were able to find it so quickly?'
Genesis 27:20 Jacob answered: 'It was God's will that what I sought quickly came before me.'
Genesis 27:21 Isaac said: 'Come closer here, so that I may touch you, my son, and determine whether you are truly Esau or not.'
Genesis 27:22 Jacob came closer to his father. Isaac, having felt him, said: 'The voice, indeed, is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.'
Genesis 27:23 And he did not recognize him, because his hairy hands resembled those of his elder son Esau. So Isaac blessed him.
Genesis 27:24 And he said: 'Are you truly my son Esau?'
Genesis 27:25 Jacob answered: 'I am.' Then Isaac said: 'Bring it to me, so I may eat of your game, my son, and my soul may bless you.'
Genesis 27:26 When Jacob brought it and Isaac had eaten, Isaac then brought out wine. After he had drunk it,
Genesis 27:27 he said to Jacob: 'Come near me and kiss me, my son.'
Genesis 27:28 Jacob came near and kissed him. As soon as Isaac smelled the fragrance of his garments, he blessed him and said: 'Look, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field full of crops, a field which the Lord has blessed.'
Genesis 27:29 'May God give you of the dew of the sky and of the richness of the earth, an abundance of grain and of new wine.'
Genesis 27:30 'May peoples serve you, and tribes bow down before you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down before you.'
Genesis 27:31 'Whoever curses you, let him be cursed; and whoever blesses you, let him be filled with blessings.'
Genesis 27:32 Scarcely had Isaac finished speaking these words, and Jacob had just gone out, when Esau arrived, returning from his hunt.
Genesis 27:33 After preparing a fine meal, he brought it to his father, saying: 'Arise, my father, and eat of your son's game, so that your soul may bless me.'
Genesis 27:34 Isaac was utterly terrified, and amazed beyond belief, saying: 'Who then was it who just now brought me game, and I ate everything before you came? And I blessed him — and he will remain blessed.'
Genesis 27:35 When Esau heard his father's words, he cried out with a loud and bitter cry, and said: 'Bless me too, my father!'
Genesis 27:36 But Isaac said: 'Your brother came deceitfully and took away your blessing.'
Genesis 27:37 Esau answered: 'He is rightly named Jacob, for he has now supplanted me a second time. First he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing too!' And again he said to his father: 'Have you not reserved a blessing for me as well?'
Genesis 27:38 Isaac answered: 'I have made him your master, and all his brothers I have subjected to his service. I have sustained him with grain and wine. And for you, my son, what more can I do?'
Genesis 27:39 Esau said to him: 'Have you only one blessing, father? Please, bless me also.' And as he wailed and wept,
Genesis 27:40 Isaac was moved and said to him: 'Behold, your blessing shall be from the richness of the earth and from the dew of the sky above.'
Genesis 28:1 So Isaac called Jacob, and he gave Jacob his blessing. Then Isaac gave Jacob a command, saying: "Do not take a wife from the people of Canaan."
Genesis 28:2 Instead, go and journey to Mesopotamia in Syria, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father. From there, take a wife for yourself from among the daughters of Laban, your uncle.
Genesis 28:3 And may Almighty God bless you, cause you to grow, and make you fruitful, so that you may become a vast assembly of peoples.
Genesis 28:4 And may He give you the blessings that Abraham received, and to your descendants after you. This is so you may possess the land where you are a sojourner—the land He promised to your grandfather, Abraham.
Genesis 28:5 So after Isaac had sent Jacob away, Jacob went to Mesopotamia in Syria, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, who was the brother of Rebecca, Jacob's mother.
Genesis 28:6 Now Esau saw that his father had blessed Jacob and sent him to Mesopotamia in Syria to get a wife from there. He also heard that after the blessing, Isaac had commanded Jacob, saying: "Do not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan."
Genesis 28:7 Esau also saw that Jacob had obeyed his parents and had gone to Mesopotamia in Syria.
Genesis 28:8 So Esau understood that the daughters of Canaan were not pleasing to his father, Isaac.
Genesis 28:9 Therefore, Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, and the sister of Nebaioth, as a wife in addition to the wives he already had.
Genesis 28:10 So Jacob set out from Beersheba and traveled towards Haran.
Genesis 28:11 When he came to a certain place where he intended to spend the night because the sun had set, he took one of the stones lying there, placed it under his head, and lay down to sleep in that same spot.
Genesis 28:12 Then he had a dream: he saw a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to the universe itself, where God dwells beyond the created cosmos. He also saw the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
Genesis 28:13 And behold, the Lord was standing above the ladder, saying to him: "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, your father, and the God of Isaac. The land on which you are sleeping, I will give to you and to your descendants."
Genesis 28:14 Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and through your descendants.
Genesis 28:15 And behold, I will be your protector wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have fulfilled everything I have spoken to you.
Genesis 28:16 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said: "Surely the Lord is present in this place, and I did not know it."
Genesis 28:17 He was afraid and said: "How awesome is this place! This is nothing less than the house of God, and the gateway to the spiritual realm, beyond the created sky."
Genesis 28:18 So Jacob rose early in the morning, took the stone he had placed under his head, set it up as a monument, and poured oil on top of it.
Genesis 28:19 And he called the name of that place Beth-el, which was formerly called Luz.
Genesis 28:20 Jacob also made a solemn vow, saying: "If God will be with me and protect me on the journey I am taking, and give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,
Genesis 28:21 and if I return safely to my father’s house, then the Lord will truly be my God."
Genesis 28:22 "And this stone, which I have set up as a monument, will be a house of God. Of all the things you give me, I will faithfully return a tenth to you."
Genesis 29:1 So Jacob continued on his journey and arrived in the land of the eastern peoples. There, he saw a well in a field with three flocks of sheep resting beside it. The shepherds used this well to water their flocks, and its opening was covered by a large stone.
Genesis 29:2 For it was from this well that the shepherds usually watered their animals. But they would only roll the stone away from the well's opening once all the flocks were gathered together, and after watering them, they would put the stone back in its place.
Genesis 29:3 Jacob then asked them, "Brothers, where are you from?" They answered, "We are from Haran."
Genesis 29:4 He then asked them, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?" They replied, "We know him."
Genesis 29:5 Jacob asked, "Is he doing well?" They answered, "He is well, and look, his daughter Rachel is coming now with her flock."
Genesis 29:6 Jacob said to the shepherds, "It is still bright daylight, and it's not yet time to bring the animals back to their pens for the night. You should water the sheep and then take them back to the pastures."
Genesis 29:7 But the shepherds replied, "We cannot do that until all the flocks have gathered, and we all together roll the stone away from the opening of the well so we can water the animals."
Genesis 29:8 While Jacob was still speaking, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess and cared for the flock herself.
Genesis 29:9 When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban—his mother's brother—and Laban's sheep, he immediately went up to the well. He single-handedly rolled away the stone from the opening and watered Laban's entire flock.
Genesis 29:10 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and, overcome with emotion, he began to weep loudly.
Genesis 29:11 He told her that he was a relative of her father, and that he was Rebekah's son. Rachel then ran quickly to tell her father this news.
Genesis 29:12 When Laban heard the news about Jacob, he immediately ran out to meet him. He embraced and kissed him, then brought him to his house. Jacob recounted everything that had happened during his journey.
Genesis 29:13 After hearing everything, Laban said, "You are truly my own flesh and blood." So Jacob stayed with Laban for a full month.
Genesis 29:14 After that month, Laban said to him, "Just because you are my relative, should you work for me for free? Tell me, what wages do you expect to receive?"
Genesis 29:15 Now, Laban had two daughters. The older one was named Leah, and the younger one was named Rachel.
Genesis 29:16 Leah's eyes were weak, or perhaps not as striking, but Rachel was beautiful in form and had a lovely appearance.
Genesis 29:17 Jacob loved Rachel deeply, so he said to Laban, "I will serve you for seven years in exchange for your younger daughter, Rachel."
Genesis 29:18 Laban answered, "It is better that I give her to you than to another man. So stay here with me."
Genesis 29:19 So Jacob served Laban for seven years for Rachel. Because of the great love he had for her, those seven years seemed to him like only a few days.
Genesis 29:20 Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for the time of my service is completed, and I wish to be with her as my wife."
Genesis 29:21 Laban then gathered all the men of that place and held a wedding feast.
Genesis 29:22 But in the evening, Laban took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob went in to her, believing she was Rachel.
Genesis 29:23 When morning came, Jacob realized that it was Leah. He said to Laban, "What have you done to me? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me like this?"
Genesis 29:24 Laban answered, "It is not the custom in our country to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one."
Genesis 29:25 Laban continued, "Complete the week of celebration for this marriage, and then I will also give you Rachel, but in return, you must serve me for another seven years."
Genesis 29:26 Jacob agreed to this arrangement. After he had completed the week for Leah's wedding, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
Genesis 29:27 And Laban also gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.
Genesis 29:28 So Jacob also went in to Rachel as his wife, and he loved Rachel much more deeply than Leah. He then served Laban for another seven years as agreed.
Genesis 29:29 Now, the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, or at least less loved than Rachel. So God enabled her to conceive children, while Rachel remained unable to bear children.
Genesis 29:30 Leah conceived and bore a son, and she named him Reuben, saying, "The Lord has seen my humiliation. Now, surely my husband will love me."
Genesis 29:31 She conceived again and bore a second son, and she named him Simeon, explaining, "Because the Lord heard that I was unloved, He has given me this son."
Genesis 29:32 She conceived a third time and bore another son, and she said, "Now this time, my husband will surely be joined to me in affection, because I have borne him three sons." Therefore, she named him Levi.
Genesis 29:33 She conceived again and bore a fourth son, and she said, "This time I will praise the Lord." Therefore, she named him Judah. After this, she stopped bearing children for a time.
Genesis 30:1 Seeing that Rachel was barren and had not given birth, she became jealous of her sister, Leah. So she said to Jacob, 'Give me children, or else I will die!'
Genesis 30:2 Jacob became angry with Rachel and answered her directly. He said, 'Am I in the place of God, who has made you unable to bear children?'
Genesis 30:3 Rachel said to him, 'Look, here is my maidservant, Bilhah. Go to her and have relations with her. Let her give birth to a child that I can claim as my own, so that I may have children through her.'
Genesis 30:4 So Rachel gave Jacob her maidservant, Bilhah, as a concubine. Jacob then had relations with her.
Genesis 30:5 Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a son.
Genesis 30:6 Rachel said, 'God has judged my cause fairly, and He has heard my voice by giving me a son.' For this reason, she named the child Dan, which means 'judge'.
Genesis 30:7 Bilhah conceived again and gave birth to a second son.
Genesis 30:8 Rachel then declared, 'I have wrestled with my sister in a mighty struggle from God, and I have overcome her.' So she named him Naphtali, meaning 'my wrestling'.
Genesis 30:9 When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing children, she took her maidservant, Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob as a concubine.
Genesis 30:10 When Zilpah had relations with Jacob, she conceived and gave birth to a son.
Genesis 30:11 Leah exclaimed, 'What good fortune has come!' For this reason, she named him Gad, meaning 'fortune' or 'troop'.
Genesis 30:12 Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, also gave birth to a second son.
Genesis 30:13 And Leah said, 'How happy I am! Women will now call me blessed!' For this reason, she named him Asher, meaning 'happy' or 'blessed'.
Genesis 30:14 One day, during the wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the field and found mandrakes. He brought them to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, 'Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.'
Genesis 30:15 Leah answered her, 'Is it not enough that you have taken away my husband? Now you want to take my son’s mandrakes too?' Rachel then said, 'Very well, Jacob will sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes.'
Genesis 30:16 When Jacob returned from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him. She told him, 'You are to come to me tonight, because I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.' So he slept with her that night.
Genesis 30:17 God listened to Leah’s prayers, and she conceived and gave birth to a fifth son.
Genesis 30:18 Leah declared, 'God has given me my reward, because I gave my maidservant to my husband.' So she named him Issachar, meaning 'reward'.
Genesis 30:19 Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son.
Genesis 30:20 She said, 'God has provided me with a good dowry. Now my husband will honor me, because I have given him six sons.' So she named him Zebulun.
Genesis 30:21 After this, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
Genesis 30:22 Then the Lord remembered Rachel. He listened to her prayers and opened her womb.
Genesis 30:23 She conceived and gave birth to a son, saying, 'God has taken away my disgrace of barrenness.'
Genesis 30:24 She named him Joseph, meaning 'may He add,' saying, 'May the Lord add another son to me.'
Genesis 30:25 After Joseph was born, Jacob said to Laban, 'Let me go, so that I may return to my own land and my homeland.'
Genesis 30:26 'Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, so that I may leave. You know well how I have served you.'
Genesis 30:27 Laban replied to him, 'If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you.'
Genesis 30:28 Then Laban said, 'Name your wages for me, and I will pay them.'
Genesis 30:29 Jacob answered, 'You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared under my care.'
Genesis 30:30 'For the little you had when I arrived has increased greatly, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I went. Now, when will I be able to provide for my own household as well?'
Genesis 30:31 Laban then asked, 'What shall I give you?' Jacob replied, 'You don't need to give me anything upfront. But if you will agree to what I am asking, I will again tend and keep your flocks.'
Genesis 30:32 'Today I will go through all your flocks and separate every speckled and spotted animal, and every dark-colored sheep among the lambs, and every spotted and speckled goat among the goats. These will be my wages.'
Genesis 30:33 'My honesty will be evident for me tomorrow, when you come to inspect my wages in your presence. Any animal that is not speckled or spotted, or any sheep that is not dark-colored, if found among my animals, will be considered stolen.'
Genesis 30:34 Laban replied, 'Very well! Let it be as you have said, and I will gladly do it.'
Genesis 30:35 However, that same day, Laban secretly separated all the male goats that were striped or spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled or spotted, and every dark-colored lamb among the sheep. He put them in the care of his sons.
Genesis 30:36 Then he put a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob. Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks.
Genesis 30:37 But Jacob took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees. He then peeled strips of bark from them, exposing the white wood underneath, while other parts remained dark.
Genesis 30:38 He placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink. The animals would look at the striped branches when they came to drink, and they would conceive while looking at them.
Genesis 30:39 As a result, the flocks conceived in front of the branches and gave birth to offspring that were striped, speckled, and spotted.
Genesis 30:40 Jacob then separated the flocks and made sure that all of Laban’s dark-colored and spotted animals faced the striped branches in the troughs. He thus caused all of Laban’s flocks to become striped, speckled, and spotted.
Genesis 31:1 Jacob heard Laban's sons saying that Jacob had taken everything that belonged to their father, and from what was their father's, Jacob had made himself all these riches.
Genesis 31:2 Jacob also noticed Laban's demeanor, and it was not favorable toward him, as it had been on previous days.
Genesis 31:3 And the Lord said to Jacob, "Return to your ancestral land, to your family, and I will be with you."
Genesis 31:4 So Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah, calling them to the field where his flocks were grazing.
Genesis 31:5 He said to them, "I see that your father's disposition towards me is no longer what it was in previous days. Yet, the God of my father has remained with me."
Genesis 31:6 And you both know that I have served your father with all my strength.
Genesis 31:7 But your father has repeatedly cheated me, changing my wages ten times; yet God did not allow him to cause me any harm.
Genesis 31:8 If ever he declared, 'The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the sheep would bear speckled young. But if he said, 'The striped ones,' then all the flocks would bear striped young.
Genesis 31:9 In this way, God has taken away your father's flocks and given them to me.
Genesis 31:10 For when the sheep were conceiving, I lifted my eyes in a dream and saw that the male goats mounting the ewes were speckled, striped, and mottled.
Genesis 31:11 And in that dream, the angel of God called to me, "Jacob!" And I answered, "Here I am."
Genesis 31:12 He said, "Look up and see all the male goats mounting the ewes are speckled, mottled, and striped. I have observed everything Laban has done to you."
Genesis 31:13 "I am the God of Bethel, where you consecrated a stone pillar and made a solemn vow to me. Now, arise and leave this land, and return to the land where you were born."
Genesis 31:14 Rachel and Leah responded, "Do we have any remaining share or inheritance in our father's household?"
Genesis 31:15 "Did he not treat us as strangers, sell us into marriage, and then spend all the money that was due to us?"
Genesis 31:16 "All the wealth and possessions that God has taken from our father now belong to us and our children. Therefore, do everything God has commanded you."
Genesis 31:17 So Jacob prepared to depart. He put his children and wives on camels and set out.
Genesis 31:18 He made haste to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan, taking with him all his possessions, all his flocks, and everything he had acquired in Mesopotamia.
Genesis 31:19 Meanwhile, Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel secretly took her father's household idols.
Genesis 31:20 Jacob kept his departure a secret from Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he was fleeing.
Genesis 31:21 After he and all he possessed had departed and crossed the river, Jacob set his course toward Mount Gilead.
Genesis 31:22 On the third day, Laban was informed that Jacob had fled.
Genesis 31:23 So Laban took his kinsmen with him and pursued Jacob for seven days, finally overtaking him on Mount Gilead.
Genesis 31:24 That night, Laban saw the Lord in a dream, who said to him, "Be careful not to speak anything harsh or threatening to Jacob."
Genesis 31:25 Jacob had already pitched his tent on the mountain. When Laban arrived with his companions, they also pitched their tents on the same Mount Gilead.
Genesis 31:26 Laban then said to Jacob, "Why have you done this? Why did you secretly lead away my daughters as if they were captives taken by the sword?"
Genesis 31:27 "Why did you not tell me, so that I could have sent you off with joy and songs, accompanied by tambourines and harps?"
Genesis 31:28 "You did not even allow my daughters and their children to kiss their father goodbye. You have acted foolishly and thoughtlessly."
Genesis 31:29 "I have the power to do you great harm. But the God of your father said to me yesterday, 'Be careful not to speak anything harsh or threatening to Jacob.'"
Genesis 31:30 "Alright, granted, you left because of your longing for home and your distress. But why did you steal my household gods?"
Genesis 31:31 Jacob replied, "Because I was afraid that you might forcefully take your daughters away from me."
Genesis 31:32 "If you find your gods with anyone here, that person shall die. In the presence of our kinsmen, examine whatever you find among my belongings and take it." Jacob said this, unaware that Rachel had stolen them.
Genesis 31:33 So Laban went into Jacob's tent, then Leah's tent, and then the tents of both maidservants, but he found nothing. When he entered Rachel's tent,
Genesis 31:34 Rachel, quickly, had hidden the idols under the camel's saddle on which she was sitting. And after he had searched all parts of the tent and found nothing,
Genesis 31:35 she said, "Do not be angry, my lord, that I cannot rise in your presence, for I am experiencing a woman's customary condition." In this way, she deceived her father, and he did not find what he was looking for.
Genesis 31:36 Then Jacob became angry and argued with Laban. He said, "What is my offense? What is my sin that you have pursued me so fiercely?"
Genesis 31:37 "After you have thoroughly searched through all my possessions, what have you found here that belongs to your household? Place it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, and let them judge between us."
Genesis 31:38 "I have been with you for twenty years. Your ewes and female goats were never barren, and I never ate the rams from your flock."
Genesis 31:39 "I never showed you an animal torn by wild beasts; I always bore the burden of such loss myself. Whatever was stolen, you demanded compensation from me."
Genesis 31:40 "By day, I was tormented by the scorching heat, and by night, by the bitter frost. Sleep often fled from my eyes."
Genesis 32:1 Jacob continued on his journey. Angels of God met him along the way.
Genesis 32:2 When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is God's camp!" So he named that place Mahanaim—meaning "Two Camps".
Genesis 32:3 Jacob then sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom, before he arrived.
Genesis 32:4 He gave them this instruction: "Tell my lord Esau: 'Your servant Jacob says this: "I have lived as a foreigner with Laban and stayed there until today."
Genesis 32:5 " 'I have oxen, donkeys, sheep, and both male and female servants. I am sending this message to my lord now, so that I may find favor in your sight.' "
Genesis 32:6 The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We went to your brother Esau, and look, he is coming to meet you, and he has four hundred men with him."
Genesis 32:7 Jacob was extremely frightened. He divided the people who were with him, along with the flocks, herds, and camels, into two separate groups.
Genesis 32:8 He said, "If Esau attacks one group and destroys it, then at least the other remaining group will be saved."
Genesis 32:9 Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, You told me, 'Return to your land and to the place of your birth, and I will be good to you.'"
Genesis 32:10 "I am unworthy of all the acts of mercy and the faithfulness You have shown to your servant. I crossed this Jordan River with nothing but my staff, and now I am returning with these two large groups of people and animals."
Genesis 32:11 "Please, rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, because I am very afraid of him. I fear that he may come and attack me, slaughtering both mothers and children alike."
Genesis 32:12 "You Yourself promised that You would do good to me and multiply my descendants like the sand of the sea, which is so numerous it cannot be counted."
Genesis 32:13 That night, after he had settled down to sleep, Jacob took some of his possessions to be a gift for his brother Esau.
Genesis 32:14 The gift consisted of two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
Genesis 32:15 thirty female camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys with ten of their young.
Genesis 32:16 He gave these animals to his servants, dividing them into separate groups. He then instructed his servants, "Go on ahead of me, and leave a clear space between each group of animals."
Genesis 32:17 He commanded the first servant, saying, "If my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'Whose servant are you? Where are you going? And to whom do these animals belong that you are driving?'"
Genesis 32:18 "You are to answer, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and Jacob himself is coming right behind us.'"
Genesis 32:19 He gave the same instructions to the second servant, and to the third, and to all those who followed with the animal groups, saying, "Speak these exact same words to Esau when you encounter him."
Genesis 32:20 "And be sure to add, 'Your servant Jacob is also coming right behind us.' " Jacob thought to himself, "I will appease him with these gifts that are going ahead of me. After that, when I see his face directly, perhaps he will receive me kindly and be reconciled with me."
Genesis 32:21 So the gifts went ahead of him, and Jacob spent that night in the camp.
Genesis 32:22 That very night, Jacob got up, took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok River.
Genesis 32:23 After he had sent them across the river, he sent over all his possessions as well.
Genesis 32:24 Jacob remained alone on the other side. Then, a man wrestled with him until dawn.
Genesis 32:25 When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he touched Jacob’s hip socket, and immediately Jacob's hip was dislocated as they wrestled.
Genesis 32:26 The man said, "Let me go, for the dawn is breaking." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
Genesis 32:27 The man then asked him, "What is your name?" He answered, "Jacob."
Genesis 32:28 The man said, "Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and have overcome." This new name signifies "He struggles with God" or "God strives."
Genesis 32:29 Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name." But the man replied, "Why do you ask for my name?" And He blessed Jacob right there in that place.
Genesis 32:30 Jacob named that place Penuel—meaning "Face of God"—saying, "I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been preserved."
Genesis 32:31 The sun rose upon him just as he was passing Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip.
Genesis 32:32 For this reason, to this very day, the children of Israel do not eat the sinew that is on the hip socket—the one that had shrunk in Jacob's thigh—because the man had touched the sinew of Jacob's hip, and it had shrunken.
Genesis 33:1 Jacob looked up, and there was Esau approaching. With Esau were four hundred men, which was cause for Jacob's immediate alarm.
Genesis 33:2 Jacob then divided his children among Leah and Rachel, and also among their two servant women, arranging them for protection.
Genesis 33:3 He placed the two servant women and their children at the very front of the procession; Leah and her children were placed behind them; and Rachel and Joseph, his most beloved, were placed last, in the safest position.
Genesis 33:4 But Jacob himself went ahead of them, bowing himself to the ground seven times in extreme submission, doing so until his brother Esau came close to him.
Genesis 33:5 Then Esau ran to meet his brother. He embraced him, put his arms around his neck, and kissed him, and they both wept.
Genesis 33:6 Esau looked up and saw the women and children. He asked Jacob, "Who are these with you?" Jacob replied, "These are the children that God has graciously given to your servant."
Genesis 33:7 Then the servant women and their children came forward, and they all bowed down to Esau.
Genesis 33:8 Next, Leah and her children came forward, and they likewise bowed down. Finally, Rachel and Joseph came forward and bowed down to Esau.
Genesis 33:9 Esau then asked, "What do you mean by all these droves and herds that I met on the way?" Jacob replied, "I hope to find favor in your sight, my lord."
Genesis 33:10 Esau said to him, "I have enough, my brother. Keep what is yours. I am well-provided for."
Genesis 33:11 Jacob replied, "No, I beg you, if I have truly found favor in your eyes, then please accept this gift from my hand. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, and you have received me graciously."
Genesis 33:12 Please accept the blessing, this gift that I have brought for you, because God has been gracious to me and has given me everything I need and more." So Jacob urged him, and Esau took the gift.
Genesis 33:13 Jacob kept urging him, and Esau finally accepted it.
Genesis 33:14 Esau then said, "Let's set out and go. I will go along with you to Seir."
Genesis 33:15 Jacob replied, "My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds nursing their young are a burden to me. If I drive them too hard for even one day, all the animals will die."
Genesis 33:16 So please, my lord, go on ahead of your servant. I will follow slowly, at the pace of the livestock and the children, until I come to you in Seir."
Genesis 33:17 Esau said, "Let me at least leave some of my people with you to help on the journey." But Jacob replied, "What need is there for that, my lord? I am content with your kindness and protection for all these things."
Genesis 33:18 So Esau turned back that day and went his way toward Seir.
Genesis 33:19 Meanwhile, Jacob journeyed to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and made temporary shelters for his livestock. Therefore, he called the place Succoth, which means 'Shelters' or 'Booths'.
Genesis 33:20 Jacob then traveled safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, after returning from Paddan-aram in Syria. He camped near the city.
Genesis 33:21 There, he bought a plot of land where he had pitched his tents from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money, or 'qesitas' in the ancient currency.
Genesis 33:22 He erected an altar there and called it El-Elohe-Israel, which means 'God, the God of Israel the Most Powerful'.
Genesis 34:1 Dina, the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to visit the women of that land.
Genesis 34:2 When Shechem saw her, he was the son of Hamor the Hivite, and ruler of that land. He desired her strongly, seized her, and then violently raped her.
Genesis 34:3 Afterward, his affections became fixed on Dina, Jacob’s daughter. He loved the girl and spoke to her with words meant to soothe her heart.
Genesis 34:4 So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, 'Get this girl for me as a wife.'
Genesis 34:5 Jacob, however, heard the news that his daughter Dina had been violently disgraced. His sons were out in the fields tending the sheep at the time. So he remained silent, waiting for them to come home.
Genesis 34:6 Then Hamor, Shechem's father, came out to Jacob to speak with him about the matter.
Genesis 34:7 When Jacob’s sons returned from the field, they heard what had been done. They were deeply enraged by the despicable act committed against Dina and the family’s honor in Israel, which was an intolerable crime.
Genesis 34:8 Then Hamor spoke to them, saying, 'My son Shechem has set his heart on your daughter. Please, give her to him in marriage. Let us form a bond of kinship between our families.'
Genesis 34:9 'Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves as wives. Then you can live among us.'
Genesis 34:10 'The land is at your disposal. You may cultivate it, engage in trade, and acquire property within it.'
Genesis 34:11 Shechem then said to Dina's father and brothers, 'Grant me this favor, please. Whatever you ask of me, I will give you.'
Genesis 34:12 'Demand as great a bride-price and gifts as you wish. I will gladly provide whatever you determine, as long as you give me the girl to be my wife.'
Genesis 34:13 Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, speaking out of anger and a desire for vengeance, because Shechem had defiled their sister Dina.
Genesis 34:14 They told them, 'We cannot do this, nor can we give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.'
Genesis 34:15 'We will only form an alliance and friendship with you on this condition: if you are willing to become like us, and every male among you is circumcised.'
Genesis 34:16 'Then we will both take your daughters as wives and give our daughters to you. We will live among you, and we will become one people.'
Genesis 34:17 'But if you men refuse to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter back and leave your land.'
Genesis 34:18 Their words seemed good to Hamor and to his son Shechem.
Genesis 34:19 The young man Shechem did not delay, but immediately did what had been commanded. He loved the girl very much, and he was the most respected and honored in all his father's house.
Genesis 34:20 Then Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the people there.
Genesis 34:21 'These men are peaceful toward us and wish to settle in our land. Let them conduct business and cultivate the land; it is spacious and vast enough for everyone. There is no reason why we should not take their daughters as wives and give our daughters to them.'
Genesis 34:22 'There is only one condition by which this friendship and alliance can be established: if all our males are circumcised, just as they themselves are circumcised.'
Genesis 34:23 'Their wealth, their livestock, and all their possessions will become ours. We only agree to this condition, and then we will live together with them as one people.'
Genesis 34:24 All the men who came out of the city gate agreed to their proposal, and every male among them was circumcised.
Genesis 34:25 Now on the third day, when the pain from their wounds was most intense, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dina's full brothers, each took his sword. They entered the city boldly and killed all the males.
Genesis 34:26 They also killed Hamor and his son Shechem. Then they took Dina from Shechem's house and departed.
Genesis 34:27 The other sons of Jacob rushed upon the slain and plundered the city as an act of vengeance for the rape of their sister.
Genesis 34:28 They took all the sheep, cattle, and donkeys, as well as everything that was in the city and in the fields.
Genesis 34:29 They carried away all the young children and the women as captives, and they plundered everything else.
Genesis 34:30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, 'You have brought trouble upon me and made me odious to the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the inhabitants of this land. My numbers are few compared to theirs. If they gather together and attack me, both I and my entire household will be destroyed.'
Genesis 34:31 But they answered, 'Should our sister have been treated like a harlot?'
Genesis 35:1 God also said to Jacob: 'Get up and go up to Bethel, and live there. Make an altar there to God, the One who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.'
Genesis 35:2 Jacob then spoke to his household and all his people, saying: 'Cast away the foreign gods that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments to symbolize your purification.'
Genesis 35:3 'Then get up, and let us go up to Bethel, so we can make an altar there to God. He heard me on the day of my trouble and has been a companion on my journey.'
Genesis 35:4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods they had, and the earrings that were in their ears – items often associated with pagan practices or amulets. Jacob buried these beneath the terebinth tree near the city of Shechem.
Genesis 35:5 When they had departed, the terror of the Lord gripped all the surrounding cities, and no one dared to pursue them.
Genesis 35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, and it was also known by the name Bethel. He and all his people were with him.
Genesis 35:7 And he built an altar there, and he called the name of that place 'God of Bethel' – meaning that God truly dwelt there. For it was there that God had appeared to him when he was fleeing from his brother.
Genesis 35:8 At that time, Deborah, Rebecca's nurse, died and was buried under an oak tree at Bethel. The name of that place was then called 'Oak of Weeping,' marking a place of great sorrow for Jacob's family.
Genesis 35:9 God appeared to Jacob again after he had returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and He blessed him.
Genesis 35:10 God said: 'Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel will be your name.' And indeed, He called his name Israel.
Genesis 35:11 And God said to him: 'I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. Both nations and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come forth from your body.'
Genesis 35:12 'And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you and to your descendants after you.'
Genesis 35:13 Then God departed from him in the very place where He had spoken with him.
Genesis 35:14 Jacob then set up a stone pillar in the place where God had spoken with him, pouring a drink offering over it and anointing it with oil to consecrate the spot.
Genesis 35:15 And he called the name of that very place, Bethel.
Genesis 35:16 Having journeyed from Bethel, they came to the land of Ephrath. While there, Rachel was giving birth, and she experienced a very difficult labor.
Genesis 35:17 After severe pains, the midwife said to her: 'Do not fear, you will also have this son.'
Genesis 35:18 As her life was ebbing away, and she was already dying, she called his name Benoni, which means 'Son of my sorrow.' But his father called him Benjamin, meaning 'Son of the right hand,' to give him a name of blessing instead.
Genesis 35:19 So Rachel died and was buried on the road to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
Genesis 35:20 Jacob set up a pillar over her grave. This pillar marks Rachel's monument even to the present day.
Genesis 35:21 Journeying from there, Israel (Jacob) pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder.
Genesis 35:22 While Jacob was dwelling in that region, Reuben went and slept with Bilhah, his father's concubine – a grave sin that deeply dishonored his father. This act did not escape Jacob's knowledge, and it would have serious consequences later. Now, the sons of Jacob were twelve in number.
Genesis 35:23 The sons of Leah were: Reuben, the firstborn; and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun.
Genesis 35:24 The sons of Rachel were: Joseph, and Benjamin.
Genesis 35:25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, were: Dan, and Naphtali.
Genesis 35:26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, were: Gad, and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Mesopotamia of Syria, in the land of Paddan-Aram.
Genesis 35:27 And Jacob also came to his father Isaac at Mamre, the city of Arba – which is Hebron. This was the place where both Abraham and Isaac had lived as sojourners, continuing the patriarchs' journey of faith.
Genesis 35:28 Isaac's life spanned one hundred and eighty years.
Genesis 35:29 Worn out by old age and full of years, Isaac died and was gathered to his people – a phrase indicating his peaceful passing into the afterlife. He was buried by his sons Esau and Jacob, marking a moment of reconciliation for them.
Genesis 36:1 This is the family line of Esau, who is also known as Edom.
Genesis 36:2 Esau took his wives from among the daughters of Canaan: Ada, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; and Oholibamah, the daughter of Ana, who was the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite.
Genesis 36:3 Also Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael, who was the sister of Nebaioth.
Genesis 36:4 These were the sons born to Esau: Eliphaz was born from Ada, and Reuel from Basemath.
Genesis 36:5 Also, from Oholibamah were born: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
Genesis 36:6 Esau took his wives, his sons and daughters, and all the people of his household, along with all his possessions, his livestock, and everything he had acquired in the land of Canaan. And he went to another region, moving away from his brother Jacob.
Genesis 36:7 Indeed, they were so wealthy that they could not live together in the same place. The land where they were staying as temporary residents could not support them both because of their many livestock.
Genesis 36:8 So Esau settled in Mount Seir. He is also known as Edom, and this region became known by his name.
Genesis 36:9 This is the family line of Esau, the ancestor of Edom, who lived in Mount Seir:
Genesis 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, the son of Ada, Esau's wife; and Reuel, the son of Basemath, Esau's wife.
Genesis 36:11 The sons of Eliphaz were: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
Genesis 36:12 And Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son, and she bore Amalek to him. These were the descendants of Ada, Esau's wife.
Genesis 36:13 The sons of Reuel were: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the descendants of Basemath, Esau's wife.
Genesis 36:14 These also were the sons of Oholibamah, daughter of Ana, who was the daughter of Zibeon—Esau's wife: to whom she bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.
Genesis 36:15 These are the chiefs (or tribal leaders) from the sons of Esau: from the sons of Eliphaz, Esau's firstborn: Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,
Genesis 36:16 Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, Chief Amalek. These are the chiefs from Eliphaz in the land of Edom, and these are the descendants of Ada.
Genesis 36:17 These also are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief Shammah, Chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs from Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the descendants of Basemath, Esau's wife.
Genesis 36:18 These also are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: Chief Jeush, Chief Jaalam, Chief Korah. These are the chiefs from Oholibamah, the daughter of Ana, Esau's wife.
Genesis 36:19 These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs. He is Edom, and these are his family lines.
Genesis 36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of that land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, and Anah,
Genesis 36:21 and Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan. These are the Horite chiefs, the sons of Seir, in the land of Seir.
Genesis 36:22 The sons of Lotan were: Hori and Hemam. And Lotan's sister was Timna (the one who became Eliphaz's concubine).
Genesis 36:23 The sons of Shobal were also: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
Genesis 36:24 The sons of Zibeon were also: Aiah and Anah. This is the same Anah who found hot springs in the desert while pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
Genesis 36:25 The children of Anah were: Dishon and Oholibamah, Anah's daughter (who became Esau's wife).
Genesis 36:26 The sons of Dishon were: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
Genesis 36:27 The sons of Ezer were also: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
Genesis 36:28 The sons of Dishan were: Uz and Aran.
Genesis 36:29 These are the Horite chiefs: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,
Genesis 36:30 Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, Chief Dishan. These are the Horite chiefs who ruled in the land of Seir.
Genesis 36:31 These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel.
Genesis 36:32 Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom. And the name of his city was Dinhabah.
Genesis 36:33 When Bela died, Jobab, the son of Zerah, from Bozrah, reigned in his place.
Genesis 36:34 When Jobab also died, Husham, from the land of the Temanites, reigned in his place.
Genesis 36:35 When he also died, Hadad, the son of Bedad, reigned in his place. He was the one who defeated Midian in the region of Moab. And the name of his city was Avith.
Genesis 36:36 When Hadad died, Samlah, from Masrekah, reigned in his place.
Genesis 36:37 When he also died, Shaul, from Rehoboth on the River, reigned in his place.
Genesis 36:38 When Shaul died, Baal-hanan, the son of Achbor, reigned in his place.
Genesis 36:39 When he also died, Hadar reigned in his place. And the name of his city was Pau. His wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, who was the daughter of Me-zahab.
Genesis 36:40 These are the names of the chiefs of Esau, listed according to their families, their places of dwelling, and their specific names: Chief Timna, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth,
Genesis 37:1 Jacob settled in the land of Canaan, which was the same land where his father had lived as a foreigner.
Genesis 37:2 This is the family record of Jacob. Joseph was sixteen years old, and though still a boy, he was tending the flock with his brothers. He was working with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, who were his father's wives. Joseph reported very serious misconduct about his brothers to his father.
Genesis 37:3 Israel (Jacob) loved Joseph more than all his other sons, because Joseph had been born to him in his old age. So Jacob made for him a long, intricately designed tunic.
Genesis 37:4 When his brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than all of them, they hated him and could not speak a single peaceful word to him.
Genesis 37:5 It happened that Joseph also had a dream, which he told his brothers about, and because of this, they hated him even more.
Genesis 37:6 And he said to them: "Listen to this dream that I had."
Genesis 37:7 "I imagined us tying up sheaves of grain in the field. And it was as if my sheaf rose up and stood upright, and your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf."
Genesis 37:8 His brothers replied: "Will you truly be our king? Or will you really rule over us?" Because of his dreams and his words, they hated him even more.
Genesis 37:9 He also had another dream, which he told his father and his brothers, saying: "I dreamed that the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
Genesis 37:10 When he told this to his father and his brothers, his father scolded him and said: "What does this dream mean that you have seen? Will I and your mother and your brothers truly bow down to you on the earth?"
Genesis 37:11 So his brothers envied him, but his father quietly considered the meaning of the matter.
Genesis 37:12 Therefore, his brothers went to pasture their father's flocks in Shechem.
Genesis 37:13 Then Israel said to Joseph: "Your brothers are pasturing the sheep in Shechem. Come, I will send you to them." And Joseph replied, "I am ready to go."
Genesis 37:14 Jacob said: "Go, and see if all is well with your brothers and the sheep, and bring me back word of what is happening." So Joseph was sent from the valley of Hebron and came to Shechem.
Genesis 37:15 And a man found him wandering in the field and asked him what he was looking for.
Genesis 37:16 He replied: "I am looking for my brothers. Tell me where they are pasturing the flocks."
Genesis 37:17 The man said to him: "They have moved on from this place. I heard them saying, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.
Genesis 37:18 When they saw him from a distance, before he came near them, they plotted to kill him.
Genesis 37:19 And they said to one another: "Look, here comes the dreamer."
Genesis 37:20 "Now then, come, let us kill him and throw him into an old cistern. Then we can say, 'A terrible wild beast devoured him,' and we will see what good his dreams will do him."
Genesis 37:21 But Reuben heard this and tried to rescue him from their hands, saying: "Let us not take his life."
Genesis 37:22 "Do not shed his blood, but throw him into this cistern, which is in the wilderness, and keep your hands free of his blood." Reuben said this intending to rescue Joseph from their hands and return him to his father.
Genesis 37:23 Therefore, when Joseph came to his brothers, they immediately stripped him of the tunic he was wearing, the intricately designed tunic.
Genesis 37:24 And they threw him into the old cistern, which had no water in it.
Genesis 37:25 And as they sat down to eat bread, they saw Ishmaelite travelers coming from Gilead, their camels carrying spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to Egypt.
Genesis 37:26 Then Judah said to his brothers: "What benefit is it to us if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?"
Genesis 37:27 "It is better that he be sold to the Ishmaelites, so that our hands are not defiled by his blood. After all, he is our brother and our own flesh." His brothers agreed.
Genesis 37:28 As Midianite merchants passed by, they pulled Joseph out of the cistern and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. These Ishmaelites then took him to Egypt.
Genesis 37:29 When Reuben returned to the cistern and did not find the boy, he tore his clothes in anguish.
Genesis 37:30 He reported to his brothers, saying: "The boy is gone! And I, where can I go now?"
Genesis 37:31 Then they took Joseph's tunic and dipped it in the blood of a slaughtered goat.
Genesis 37:32 They sent the tunic to their father with the message: "We found this. See if it is your son's tunic or not."
Genesis 37:33 When he recognized it, he said: "It is my son's tunic! A terrible wild beast has eaten him; a beast has devoured Joseph."
Genesis 37:34 And tearing his clothes, he mourned for his son for a very long time.
Genesis 37:35 All his children gathered to comfort their father, but he refused to be comforted and said: "I will go down to my son, mourning, into the underworld of the dead." And he continued weeping.
Genesis 37:36 Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, who was the commander of the royal guard.

Genesis 38:1 At that time, Judah left his brothers. He turned aside and went to stay with a man from Adullam, whose name was Hirah.
Genesis 38:2 There he saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shuah. He took her as his wife and then went in to her.
Genesis 38:3 She conceived and bore a son, and Judah called his name Er.
Genesis 38:4 Again she conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
Genesis 38:5 She bore a third son, whom she named Shelah. Judah himself was in Canaan when Shelah was born.
Genesis 38:6 Then Judah took a wife for his firstborn son, Er. Her name was Tamar.
Genesis 38:7 But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord put him to death.
Genesis 38:8 Therefore, Judah said to Onan: 'Go in to your brother's wife and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.'
Genesis 38:9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be considered his own. So, when he went in to his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, so that he would not raise up offspring in his brother's name.
Genesis 38:10 And for this reason, the Lord struck him down, because he did such a detestable thing.
Genesis 38:11 Therefore, Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law: 'Remain a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up.' Judah was actually thinking that Shelah also might die, just as his brothers had. So, Tamar went and remained in her father's house.
Genesis 38:12 After many days, Shuah's daughter, Judah's wife, died. When the period of mourning was over, Judah went up to Timnah to his sheep shearers, along with his friend Hirah, the Adullamite, who was the shepherd of his flock.
Genesis 38:13 And it was told to Tamar: 'Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.'
Genesis 38:14 So, she took off her widow's garments, covered herself with a veil, and disguised herself. Then she sat at the fork in the road that leads to Timnah, because she saw that Shelah was grown up, yet she had not been given to him as a wife.
Genesis 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had covered her face.
Genesis 38:16 He turned aside to her on the way and said: 'Let me come in to you,' not knowing that she was his daughter-in-law. She answered: 'What will you give me if you come in to me?'
Genesis 38:17 He answered: 'I will send you a young goat from the flock.' She replied: 'Will you give me a pledge until you send it?'
Genesis 38:18 Judah said: 'What pledge shall I give you?' She answered: 'Your signet ring, your bracelet, and your staff that is in your hand.' So he gave her what she asked, and went in to her. And she conceived by him.
Genesis 38:19 As soon as he had departed, she rose and went away, and taking off her disguise, she put on her widow's garments again.
Genesis 38:20 Then Judah sent the young goat by his friend Hirah, the Adullamite shepherd, so that he might retrieve the pledge from the woman. But Hirah could not find her.
Genesis 38:21 He asked the men of that place: 'Where is the harlot who was sitting at the fork in the road?' They answered: 'There has been no harlot in this place.'
Genesis 38:22 So, Hirah returned to Judah and said to him: 'I could not find her. Moreover, the men of that place told me that there had been no harlot sitting there.'
Genesis 38:23 Judah said: 'Let her keep the items then, lest we become a laughingstock. I sent the young goat, and you could not find her.'
Genesis 38:24 About three months later, it was told to Judah: 'Your daughter-in-law Tamar has committed harlotry, and behold, she is found to be with child.' Judah said: 'Bring her out, that she may be burned.'
Genesis 38:25 As she was being led out to be executed, she sent to her father-in-law, saying: 'By the man to whom these things belong, by him I am pregnant.' She added: 'Please recognize whose signet ring, bracelet, and staff these are.'
Genesis 38:26 When Judah recognized them, he said: 'She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to my son Shelah.' And he did not lie with her again.
Genesis 38:27 Now, at the time of her delivery, it was discovered that she had twins in her womb.
Genesis 38:28 And as she was giving birth, one of the babies put out a hand. The midwife tied a scarlet thread on its hand, saying: 'This one will come out first.'
Genesis 38:29 But he drew back his hand, and then his brother came out. And the midwife said: 'Why have you made a breach for yourself?' So, for this reason, his name was called Perez.
Genesis 38:30 After him, his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread. And his name was called Zerah.

Genesis 39:1 Joseph had been brought to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the royal guard—not necessarily a eunuch in the literal sense, but a high-ranking court official—bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.
Genesis 39:2 The Lord was with Joseph, and he prospered in all that he did. He lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
Genesis 39:3 Potiphar saw that the Lord was with Joseph, and that God guided all of Joseph’s work to success.
Genesis 39:4 Because of this, Joseph found favor with Potiphar and became his personal attendant. Potiphar placed Joseph in charge of his entire household and all his possessions.
Genesis 39:5 From the moment Potiphar appointed Joseph over his house and over all that he owned, the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s household because of Joseph. The Lord’s blessing multiplied everything that belonged to Potiphar, both in his house and in his fields.
Genesis 39:6 Potiphar no longer had to worry about anything, except the food he ate. Joseph was handsome in face and appearance.
Genesis 39:7 After a long time, Potiphar’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, "Sleep with me."
Genesis 39:8 But Joseph refused, and said to her, "Look, my master does not know what he has in his house, and he has entrusted everything he owns to me."
Genesis 39:9 "No one in this house is greater than I am. He has not denied me anything except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against my God?"
Genesis 39:10 She pressed him day after day, but he refused to agree. He would not even lie down with her or spend time with her anymore.
Genesis 39:11 So one day Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the household servants were inside.
Genesis 39:12 But she grabbed his cloak, saying, "Sleep with me!" Joseph left his cloak in her hand, fled, and ran outside.
Genesis 39:13 When the woman saw that his cloak was in her hands and that he had run away,
Genesis 39:14 she called her household servants and said to them, "Look! My husband brought this Hebrew man here to mock us. He came into my room, saying, 'Sleep with me!' And when I screamed,"
Genesis 39:15 "and he heard my voice crying out, he left his cloak with me and ran outside."
Genesis 39:16 So she laid his cloak beside her until her husband came home.
Genesis 39:17 She spoke to him with the very same words, saying, "The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to mock me."
Genesis 39:18 "And when he heard me crying out, he left his cloak with me and fled outside."
Genesis 39:19 When Joseph’s master heard his wife’s words—especially hearing the exact same story she told him—he became very angry.
Genesis 39:20 So he had Joseph thrown into the prison where the king’s prisoners were held. And there Joseph remained, shut away.
Genesis 39:21 But the Lord was with Joseph, and He extended His mercy to him, granting him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
Genesis 39:22 The warden put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners who were held in custody. Whatever needed to be done there was done under Joseph’s supervision.
Genesis 39:23 The warden did not carefully oversee anything that was entrusted to Joseph, because the Lord was with Joseph, and the Lord directed all his work.
Genesis 39:24 After these events, it happened that two of Pharaoh’s officials, his chief cupbearer and his chief baker, offended their lord, the king of Egypt.
Genesis 39:25 Pharaoh was angry with them both—the cupbearer and the baker—
Genesis 39:26 and he put them in the prison of the captain of the royal guard, the very place where Joseph was imprisoned.
Genesis 39:27 The captain of the royal guard assigned Joseph to serve them, and he did so.
Genesis 39:28 So they remained in custody for a considerable time.
Genesis 39:29 One night, both of them—the cupbearer and the baker—had a dream, each with its own specific meaning. Each man dreamed his own dream.
Genesis 39:30 When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw that they were distressed,
Genesis 39:31 he asked them, "Why are your faces sadder than usual today?"
Genesis 39:32 They answered, "We had dreams, and there is no one here to interpret them for us."
Genesis 39:33 Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Please, tell me what you dreamed."
Genesis 39:34 So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said, "In my dream, I saw a vine."
Genesis 39:35 "On the vine were three branches, which began to bud, then blossomed, and then ripened into clusters of grapes."
Genesis 39:36 "I held Pharaoh’s cup in my hand. I took the grapes, pressed them into the cup I was holding, and then handed the cup to Pharaoh."
Genesis 39:37 Joseph answered, saying, "This is the interpretation of your dream: The three branches represent three days."
Genesis 39:38 "Within three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head—meaning, he will restore you to your former position. You will then hand him his cup, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer."
Genesis 39:39 "Only remember me when things go well for you, and show me kindness. Mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison."
Genesis 39:40 "For I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews, and here I am, innocent, thrown into this pit of a prison."
Genesis 40:1 After all this, two royal officials of the King of Egypt—his chief butler and his chief baker—committed a sin against their lord, the king.
Genesis 40:2 Pharaoh became very angry with these two royal officials, the chief butler and the chief baker. He had them sent to the prison in the house of the captain of the guard, which was the very place where Joseph was being held captive.
Genesis 40:3 The captain of the guard placed these two officials under Joseph's care, and Joseph began to serve them. All the tasks performed in that part of the prison fell under Joseph's responsibility.
Genesis 40:4 For some time, these men were kept under Joseph's watch. Joseph visited them frequently while they were in custody, ensuring they were served as instructed.
Genesis 40:5 One night, both the butler and the baker, who were prisoners of the King of Egypt, each had a dream. Each dream held a specific interpretation for the one who dreamed it.
Genesis 40:6 When Joseph came to them in the morning, he noticed that both of them looked sad and troubled.
Genesis 40:7 So he asked them, "Why do you both look so much sadder than usual today?"
Genesis 40:8 They answered him, saying, "We both had dreams, and there is no one here to interpret them for us." Joseph then said to them, "Doesn't the power to interpret dreams belong to God alone? Please tell me your dreams, and I will seek His understanding."
Genesis 40:9 So the chief butler told Joseph his dream, saying, "In my dream, I saw a vine directly in front of me.
Genesis 40:10 On this vine, there were three branches. As I watched, it slowly budded, then blossomed, and finally, ripe grapes appeared on the clusters.
Genesis 40:11 I held Pharaoh's cup in my hand. I took the grapes, squeezed their juice directly into the cup I was holding, and then presented the drink to Pharaoh."
Genesis 40:12 Joseph replied, "This is the meaning of your dream: the three branches represent three days from now.
Genesis 40:13 Within three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, meaning he will restore you to your former position. You will then give him his cup, just as you used to do when you served as his butler before."
Genesis 40:14 "Only remember me when things go well for you. Show kindness to me by mentioning me to Pharaoh so that you can get me out of this prison.
Genesis 40:15 For I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews, and even here, I have done nothing to deserve being thrown into this pit."
Genesis 40:16 When the chief baker saw that Joseph had interpreted the dream so skillfully, he said, "I also had a dream. In my dream, I had three baskets of baked goods on my head.
Genesis 40:17 In the topmost basket, there were all kinds of baked goods that Pharaoh usually eats, and the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."
Genesis 40:18 Joseph responded, "This is the interpretation of your dream: the three baskets represent three days from now.
Genesis 40:19 Within three days, Pharaoh will lift off your head, meaning he will execute you and hang your body on a tree. Then the birds of the sky will tear at your flesh."
Genesis 40:20 And so it happened that on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he gave a great feast for all his servants. At this feast, he remembered the chief butler and the chief baker.
Genesis 40:21 He restored the chief butler to his office, and once again the butler presented the cup to Pharaoh.
Genesis 40:22 But he had the chief baker hanged, just as Joseph had interpreted their dreams for them.
Genesis 40:23 Despite this, the chief butler did not remember Joseph. Instead, he completely forgot about him.
Genesis 41:1 After two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream. He dreamt he was standing by the Nile River,
Genesis 41:2 And suddenly, in his dream, seven beautiful, well-fed cows came up out of the river. They were grazing in a marshy place.
Genesis 41:3 Then, seven other cows emerged from the river, but these were ugly and scrawny. They began to graze right next to the beautiful cows on the riverbank.
Genesis 41:4 The ugly and scrawny cows then devoured the seven beautiful, well-fed cows. Pharaoh woke up from his dream.
Genesis 41:5 He then fell asleep again and had another dream. In this dream, seven heads of grain, full and beautiful, were growing on a single stalk.
Genesis 41:6 Then, seven other heads of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind, grew up on a different stalk.
Genesis 41:7 These thin heads of grain devoured all the beauty of the full, first heads of grain. Pharaoh woke up from his sleep and understood that these dreams were from God.
Genesis 41:8 When morning came, Pharaoh was deeply troubled by the dream. He sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt, and he told them his dream, but none of them could interpret it for him.
Genesis 41:9 Then, the chief cupbearer, remembering Joseph, spoke up and said, 'I must confess my fault to you now.'
Genesis 41:10 'When Pharaoh was angry with me and the chief baker, you had us put in prison in the house of the captain of the guard.'
Genesis 41:11 'One night, both he and I each had a dream, and each of our dreams had a mysterious meaning.'
Genesis 41:12 'There was a young Hebrew man there, a servant of that same captain of the guard. When we told him our dreams, he interpreted them for us.'
Genesis 41:13 'And everything happened exactly as he predicted: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged.'
Genesis 41:14 Immediately, at the king's command, Joseph was quickly brought out of the prison dungeon. They shaved him and changed his clothes, then brought him to Pharaoh.
Genesis 41:15 Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it for me. But I have heard that you are able to interpret dreams with great wisdom.'
Genesis 41:16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, 'It is not within my power, but God Himself will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.'
Genesis 41:17 So Pharaoh recounted what he had seen, saying, 'I dreamt that I was standing on the bank of the Nile River.'
Genesis 41:18 'And suddenly, seven very beautiful and extremely well-fed cows came up out of the river. They grazed in the marshy places and remained standing near me.'
Genesis 41:19 'Then, seven other cows came up, thin and extremely scrawny, with dried-out hides. I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.'
Genesis 41:20 'These scrawny cows devoured and consumed the first, fat, and beautiful cows.'
Genesis 41:21 'Even after they had eaten them, there was no sign in their appearance that they had eaten at all; they remained as gaunt and scrawny as before. Then I woke up.'
Genesis 41:22 'And again, I saw another dream: Seven heads of grain, full and excellent, were growing on a single stalk.'
Genesis 41:23 'Then, seven other heads of grain grew up, thin and scorched by the east wind, producing only meager kernels.'
Genesis 41:24 'These thin heads of grain devoured the beauty of the first ones. I have told this to the magicians, but there is no one who can interpret it.'
Genesis 41:25 Joseph answered Pharaoh, 'Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same; God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do.'
Genesis 41:26 'The seven beautiful cows and the seven full heads of grain represent seven years of abundant harvests. The interpretation of both dreams is the same.'
Genesis 41:27 'And the seven thin and scrawny cows that came up after them, as well as the seven thin heads of grain scorched by the east wind, represent seven years of famine that are coming.'
Genesis 41:28 'This is what I have told Pharaoh: God has shown you what is soon to happen.'
Genesis 41:29 'Behold, seven years are coming, years of great abundance throughout all the land of Egypt.'
Genesis 41:30 'These will be followed by seven other years of such severe famine that all the previous abundance in the land of Egypt will be completely forgotten. The famine will utterly consume the land.'
Genesis 41:31 'There will be no remaining sign of the former abundance because of the severity of the famine that follows, which will utterly consume the entire land.'
Genesis 41:32 'The fact that you saw the same matter in a second dream means that the word is firmly established by God, and He will swiftly bring it to pass.'
Genesis 41:33 'Therefore, let Pharaoh now find a wise and discerning man and appoint him over the land of Egypt.'
Genesis 41:34 'Let this man appoint overseers in every city to gather and store a fifth part of all the produce of the land of Egypt during the coming seven years of abundance.'
Genesis 41:35 'Let all the surplus grain, which will be sufficient for the five years of famine, be stored in the cities and kept securely.'
Genesis 41:36 'Let this grain be ready for the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the land may not be ruined by scarcity.'
Genesis 41:37 Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased with this advice.
Genesis 41:38 Then Pharaoh said to his officials, 'Can we find anyone else like this man, in whom the Spirit of God is present?'
Genesis 41:39 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'Since God has shown you all that you have spoken, surely I will not be able to find anyone wiser or with such discernment as you.'
Genesis 41:40 'You shall be in charge of my household, and all my people will obey your every command. Only in the royal throne itself will I be greater than you.'
Genesis 42:1 Jacob saw that grain and food were being sold in Egypt. He asked his sons, "Why are you just sitting here doing nothing?"
Genesis 42:2 He continued, "I have heard that food is available for purchase in Egypt. Go down there and buy what we need to survive, so that we do not die of starvation."
Genesis 42:3 So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain for themselves and their families.
Genesis 42:4 But Jacob did not want to send Benjamin, Joseph's younger brother, with his other brothers. He was afraid that something terrible might happen to him on the journey.
Genesis 42:5 The sons of Israel arrived in Egypt along with many others who had also come to buy food, because the land of Canaan was suffering greatly from the famine.
Genesis 42:6 Joseph, as it happened, was the governor of the entire land of Egypt, and he was the one selling grain to all the people. When his brothers came before him, they bowed down with their faces to the ground in reverence.
Genesis 42:7 Joseph saw them and immediately remembered the dreams he had once had about them. He spoke harshly to them, as if they were strangers, asking, "Where do you come from?" They replied, "From the land of Canaan, to buy necessities for life."
Genesis 42:8 Joseph recognized them, but they did not recognize him.
Genesis 42:9 He held them there for a short time and then said, "You are spies! You have come to find the vulnerable points of this land."
Genesis 42:10 But they answered him, "No, my lord, that is not true. Your servants have only come to buy food."
Genesis 42:11 "We are all the sons of one man; we are honest people. We have not come here to do any harm."
Genesis 42:12 Joseph said to them, "No! You have indeed come to discover the vulnerable parts of this land."
Genesis 42:13 They replied, "Your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is currently with our father, and another brother is no longer with us."
Genesis 42:14 Joseph, testing them, said, "This confirms what I said: You are spies!"
Genesis 42:15 "By this method, you will be tested. I swear by the life of Pharaoh himself, you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here."
Genesis 42:16 "Send one of you back to bring him here. The rest of you will be kept imprisoned until what you have said can be proven true or false."
Genesis 42:17 And so he held them in custody for three days.
Genesis 42:18 On the third day, he brought them out of the prison and said to them, "Do this one thing, and you will live, for I fear God."
Genesis 42:19 "If you truly are honest people, then let one of your brothers be kept bound in the prison. The rest of you may go and take the grain you have purchased back to your homes."
Genesis 42:20 "Then bring your youngest brother to me so I can verify your claims. If you do this, you will not die." They did as he had instructed.
Genesis 42:21 They spoke to each other, saying, "We truly deserve to suffer this, because we sinned against our brother Joseph. We saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, but we refused to listen to him. That is why this tribulation has come upon us now."
Genesis 42:22 Reuben said to them, "Did I not tell you, 'Do not sin against the boy'? But you would not listen to me! Now, surely, the price for his blood is being demanded of us."
Genesis 42:23 They did not know that Joseph understood everything they were saying, because he was speaking to them through an interpreter.
Genesis 42:24 Joseph turned away from them for a moment and wept. Then he turned back and spoke to them. He took Simeon and had him bound in chains right there in front of their eyes.
Genesis 42:25 Joseph then gave orders for their sacks to be filled with grain. He also commanded that each man's money be secretly returned to his sack and that they be given provisions for their journey. His servants did exactly as he instructed.
Genesis 42:26 So the brothers loaded the grain onto their donkeys and departed.
Genesis 42:27 As one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey at the lodging place, he saw his money right there at the mouth of the sack.
Genesis 42:28 He cried out to his brothers, "My money has been returned to me! Look, it is right here in my sack!" They were astonished and troubled, asking each other, "What is this that God has done to us?"
Genesis 42:29 When they arrived back to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them, saying:
Genesis 42:30 "The lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of being spies in his territory."
Genesis 42:31 "We told him, 'We are honest men; we are not plotting against anyone.'"
Genesis 42:32 "We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One of us is no longer living, and the youngest is currently with our father in the land of Canaan."
Genesis 42:33 "Then he said, 'By this I will prove that you are honest people: leave one of your brothers with me. Take the necessary food for your households and go on your way.'"
Genesis 42:34 "Then bring your youngest brother to me, so I can know that you are not spies. Then you can have your imprisoned brother back, and you will be free to trade in this land.'"
Genesis 42:35 As they were telling this, they emptied their sacks. And behold, each man found his own pouch of money inside his sack! They and their father were terrified when they saw this.
Genesis 42:36 Jacob cried out, "You have left me without my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon has been kept from me, and now you want to take Benjamin away! All these misfortunes have fallen upon me!"
Genesis 42:37 Reuben responded to him, "You may kill my two sons if I do not bring Benjamin back to you. Entrust him into my care, and I myself will bring him back."
Genesis 42:38 But Jacob insisted, "My son will not go down to Egypt with you. His brother Joseph is dead, and he is the only son of Rachel left to me. If any harm were to befall him on this journey you are making, you would bring my gray hairs down to the grave in sorrow."

Genesis 43:1 The famine continued to grow more severe in all the land.
Genesis 43:2 After they had eaten all the grain they had brought back from Egypt, Jacob told his sons, "Go back to Egypt and buy a little more food for us."
Genesis 43:3 Judah answered his father, "The man warned us with a solemn oath, saying, 'You will not see my face again unless your youngest brother is with you.'"
Genesis 43:4 "So if you are willing to send Benjamin with us, we will go down and buy food for you."
Genesis 43:5 "But if you refuse to send him, we will not go down, because, as we have told you many times, that man explicitly warned us, saying, 'You will not see my face unless your youngest brother is with you.'"
Genesis 43:6 Israel, also known as Jacob, said to them, "Why have you brought such trouble upon me by telling that man you had another son?"
Genesis 43:7 But they answered, "The man questioned us very carefully about our family lineage, asking if our father was still alive, and if we had another brother. We answered him exactly according to what he asked. How could we possibly know that he would demand, 'Bring your brother with you?'"
Genesis 43:8 Judah also said to his father, "Send the young man with me, so that we can leave right away. Then we can all live and not die of starvation—not only us, but also you and our little children."
Genesis 43:9 "I will guarantee the young man's safety. Hold me personally responsible for his life. If I do not bring him back to you and present him before you, then I will bear the guilt forever."
Genesis 43:10 "If we had not delayed so much, we could have already gone and come back a second time."
Genesis 43:11 So their father Israel said to them, "If it must be this way, then do what you must. Take some of the best produce of the land in your bags, and take a gift to the man: a little balm, a little honey, some gum tragacanth, some myrrh, some pistachios, and some almonds."
Genesis 43:12 "Also, take double the amount of money with you, and take back the money that you found in your sacks. Perhaps it was put there by mistake."
Genesis 43:13 "And take your brother Benjamin with you, and go back to the man."
Genesis 43:14 "May my all-powerful God grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother, whom he is holding, along with this Benjamin. As for me, I feel as though I am already bereaved and childless."
Genesis 43:15 So the men took the gifts, and double the money, and Benjamin. They set off for Egypt and stood before Joseph.
Genesis 43:16 When Joseph saw them with Benjamin, he instructed the steward of his house, saying, "Bring these men into the house. Slaughter an animal and prepare a feast, for they are to dine with me at noon."
Genesis 43:17 The steward did exactly as Joseph commanded him and brought the men into Joseph's house.
Genesis 43:18 But the men, once brought inside, were afraid. They said, "We have been brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time. They want to frame us and violently seize us, taking us and our donkeys as slaves."
Genesis 43:19 Therefore, they approached the steward of Joseph's house and spoke to him at the entrance.
Genesis 43:20 (Continuing from the previous verse) "O sir, we really did come down here the first time to buy food."
Genesis 43:21 "But when we returned to the inn and opened our sacks, we found each man's money right there at the mouth of his sack. We have now brought it back, exactly the same weight."
Genesis 43:22 "We have also brought other money with us to buy more food. We truly do not know who put the money in our sacks the first time."
Genesis 43:23 But the steward replied, "Peace be with you. Do not be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, must have given you treasure in your sacks. I assure you, I received your money the first time." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
Genesis 43:24 After he had brought the men into the house, he brought water for them to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.
Genesis 43:25 They prepared their gifts until Joseph arrived at noon, for they had heard that they were to eat the meal there.
Genesis 43:26 When Joseph came into his house, they presented him with the gifts they held in their hands, and they bowed down before him, with their faces to the ground.
Genesis 43:27 He greeted them kindly and asked, "Is your aged father, whom you spoke of to me, well? Is he still alive?"
Genesis 43:28 They replied, "Your servant, our father, is well and still alive." Then they bowed down and prostrated themselves again before him.
Genesis 43:29 And Joseph, looking up, saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother's son, and asked, "Is this your youngest brother, about whom you told me?" Then he added, "May God be gracious to you, my son."
Genesis 43:30 Joseph hurried away and went into his private room, because his heart was deeply moved with tender affection for his brother, and he began to weep. He went into his chamber and wept there.
Genesis 43:31 After he had washed his face and composed himself, he came out and said, "Serve the food."
Genesis 43:32 They served Joseph by himself, and his brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves—because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, as such a shared meal was considered detestable to the Egyptians.
Genesis 43:33 So the brothers were seated before Joseph, arranged from the eldest to the youngest. All of them were astonished, looking at each other in wonder.
Genesis 43:34 Joseph then had portions of food taken from his own table and given to them. Benjamin's portion was five times larger than any of the others. And they drank and feasted joyfully with him.
Genesis 44:1 Joseph then gave his house steward a command, saying: 'Fill their sacks with as much grain as they can carry, and put each man's money on top, in his sack.'
Genesis 44:2 'But my own silver cup, and the money for it, you are to put into the mouth of the youngest man’s sack.'
Genesis 44:3 When they woke up in the morning and loaded their donkeys, they left the city.
Genesis 44:4 Now, after they had gone a short distance, Joseph called his house steward and said: 'Get up and pursue those men! When you catch them, ask: Why have you repaid good with evil?'
Genesis 44:5 'The cup you have stolen is the one my master drinks from and uses for divination. You have done a very wicked thing.'
Genesis 44:6 The steward pursued them, caught up, and said all the words Joseph had commanded him.
Genesis 44:7 They replied: 'Why does our lord speak to his servants this way? Far be it from us to do such a thing!'
Genesis 44:8 'We brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found at the top of our sacks. How could we steal silver or gold from your master's house?'
Genesis 44:9 'If the cup is found with any of your servants, let that man die, and the rest of us will become your master's servants.'
Genesis 44:10 The steward replied: 'Let it be as you say. The man with whom it is found will become my servant, but you others will be innocent.'
Genesis 44:11 So they quickly lowered their sacks to the ground and each man opened his.
Genesis 44:12 The steward searched, starting with the oldest and going down to the youngest, and he found the cup in Benjamin’s sack.
Genesis 44:13 Immediately, they tore their clothes in grief, loaded their donkeys again, and returned to the city.
Genesis 44:14 So Judah and his brothers entered Joseph’s house while he was still there. They prostrated themselves before him on the ground.
Genesis 44:15 Joseph asked them: 'Why did you want to act this way? Do you not know that no one like me can divine what is hidden?'
Genesis 44:16 Judah replied: 'What can we say to our lord? What can we speak? Or how can we respond justly? God has found the iniquity of your servants. Look, all of us are now servants of our lord, both we and the man with whom the cup was found.'
Genesis 44:17 Joseph answered: 'Far be it from me to do that! The man who stole the cup, he alone will be my servant. But you others, go up freely to your father.'
Genesis 44:18 Then Judah approached him and said: 'Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word in your hearing, and do not be angry with your servant, for you are as powerful as Pharaoh himself.'
Genesis 44:19 'My lord asked us, saying: Do you have a father or a brother?'
Genesis 44:20 'And we answered him: We have an aged father, and a young boy born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and our father truly loves him.'
Genesis 44:21 'You also said to your servants: Bring him down to me, so I may look at him.'
Genesis 44:22 'We replied: The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.'
Genesis 44:23 'And you said to your servants: Unless your youngest brother comes with you, you will not see my face again.'
Genesis 44:24 'So when we went up to your servant, our father, we told him everything our lord had said.'
Genesis 44:25 'And our father said: Go back and buy us a little grain.'
Genesis 44:26 'To which we said: We cannot go. If our youngest brother comes down with us, then we will go together. Otherwise, without him, we do not dare to see the man’s face.'
Genesis 44:27 'To this our father replied: You yourselves know that I had two sons by my wife.'
Genesis 44:28 'One left, and you said: A wild beast devoured him. And until the present day, you do not know where he is.'
Genesis 44:29 'If you also take this one, and anything happens to him on the journey, you will bring my gray hairs down to the grave in sorrow.'
Genesis 44:30 'Therefore, if I go to your servant, our father, and the boy is not with me—whose very life is bound up with his father's—'
Genesis 44:31 'when he suddenly sees that the boy is not there, he will die. And your servants will bring his gray hairs down to the grave in sorrow.'
Genesis 44:32 'I myself guaranteed the boy's safety to my father, saying: If I do not bring him back to you, I will be guilty of sin against my father for all my days.'
Genesis 44:33 'Now therefore, I beg you, let your servant remain here as a servant in your place, instead of the boy, and let the boy go up with his brothers.'
Genesis 44:34 'For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I see the calamity that would overcome my father.'
Genesis 45:1 Joseph could no longer control his emotions in front of everyone present. So, he ordered everyone to leave, so that no outsider would be there when he spoke with his family.
Genesis 45:2 Then Joseph cried out loudly, weeping, and the Egyptians heard it, and all of Pharaoh’s household heard it.
Genesis 45:3 He said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?" But they could not answer him, because they were terrified.
Genesis 45:4 Then he said to his brothers, "Come closer to me." And when they came closer, he said, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."
Genesis 45:5 Do not be distressed or blame yourselves for selling me into this region. God, in His divine plan, sent me ahead of you to preserve your lives.
Genesis 45:6 For it has been two years since the famine began in this land, and there are still five more years to come during which neither plowing nor harvesting will be possible.
Genesis 45:7 God sent me ahead of you so that you might be preserved on the earth, and that you might have food to keep yourselves alive.
Genesis 45:8 So it was not by your doing, but by God’s design, that I was sent here. He has made me like a father to Pharaoh, lord over his entire household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Genesis 45:9 Hurry, go up to my father and tell him: 'Your son Joseph says this: God has made me lord over all the land of Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay!'
Genesis 45:10 You will live in the land of Goshen, and you will be near me—you, your children, your grandchildren, your sheep, your cattle, and everything you own.
Genesis 45:11 There I will provide for you (for there are still five years of famine ahead), so that you, your household, and everything you own will not suffer want.
Genesis 45:12 Behold, your own eyes, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, see that it is my own mouth speaking to you.
Genesis 45:13 Tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and everything you have seen. Hurry and bring him down to me.
Genesis 45:14 Then Joseph threw his arms around his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept; and Benjamin likewise wept upon his neck.
Genesis 45:15 Joseph then kissed all his brothers and wept over each one of them. After this, his brothers finally dared to speak with him.
Genesis 45:16 News spread quickly through Pharaoh’s palace that Joseph’s brothers had arrived, and Pharaoh and all his officials were very pleased.
Genesis 45:17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Command your brothers to load their pack animals and set out for the land of Canaan."
Genesis 45:18 "Let them bring your father and all their relatives back here to me. I will give them all the best of Egypt, so they may enjoy the richness of the land."
Genesis 45:19 "Also command them to take wagons from the land of Egypt for themselves, their little ones, and their wives, and to bring your father quickly."
Genesis 45:20 "Do not worry about any of your belongings, because all the finest things in Egypt will be yours."
Genesis 45:21 The sons of Israel did as they were instructed. Joseph gave them wagons, according to Pharaoh’s command, and also provisions for their journey.
Genesis 45:22 To each of them, he also gave a set of new clothes. But to Benjamin, he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five sets of new clothes.
Genesis 45:23 He also sent his father ten donkeys loaded with the best products of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and other food supplies for his journey.
Genesis 45:24 So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he told them, "Do not quarrel on the journey."
Genesis 45:25 So they went up from Egypt and arrived in the land of Canaan, to their father Jacob.
Genesis 45:26 They told him, saying, "Joseph is alive! And he is the ruler over all the land of Egypt!" When Jacob heard this, it was as if he awoke from a deep sleep, and he did not believe them.
Genesis 45:27 But when they recounted all the words Joseph had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons and all the supplies Joseph had sent, Jacob’s spirit was revived.
Genesis 45:28 And Jacob said, "It is enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I will go and see him before I die."

Genesis 46:1 So Israel set out with everything he owned. He came to the place called the Well of the Oath. There, he offered sacrifices and called upon the God of his father, Isaac.
Genesis 46:2 And God spoke to him through a vision at night, saying, 'Jacob! Jacob!' And he answered, 'Here I am.'
Genesis 46:3 God said to him, 'I am the Almighty God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.'
Genesis 46:4 I myself will go down with you into Egypt, and I will surely bring you back from there. And Joseph himself will be there to close your eyes when you die.'
Genesis 46:5 So Jacob rose up from the Well of the Oath. His sons then carried him, his children, and his wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to transport the old man.
Genesis 46:6 They also took all the possessions he had acquired in the land of Canaan. So Jacob and all his offspring together came into Egypt.
Genesis 46:7 His sons, his grandsons, his daughters, and his granddaughters—all of his offspring he brought with him to Egypt.
Genesis 46:8 These are the names of the sons of Israel who went into Egypt: Jacob himself and his children. His firstborn was Reuben.
Genesis 46:9 The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
Genesis 46:10 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul—who was the son of a Canaanite woman.
Genesis 46:11 The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
Genesis 46:12 The sons of Judah were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. However, Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan. The sons born to Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
Genesis 46:13 The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron.
Genesis 46:14 The sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
Genesis 46:15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, and Dinah was also his daughter. All the souls of males and females were thirty-three.
Genesis 46:16 The sons of Gad were Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
Genesis 46:17 The sons of Asher were Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel.
Genesis 46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. And these Jacob bore to her, a total of sixteen souls.
Genesis 46:19 The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife, were Joseph and Benjamin.
Genesis 46:20 And sons were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him: Manasseh and Ephraim.
Genesis 46:21 The sons of Benjamin were Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
Genesis 46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, whom Jacob bore to her, all of them fourteen souls.
Genesis 46:23 The sons of Dan were Hushim.
Genesis 46:24 The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
Genesis 46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. And Jacob bore these to her, all of them seven souls.
Genesis 46:26 All the souls who entered Egypt with Jacob, those who came from his loins, excluding his sons' wives, were sixty-six in total.
Genesis 46:27 As for Joseph's sons, who were born to him in the land of Egypt, there were two souls. All the souls of Jacob's household who entered Egypt were seventy in total.
Genesis 46:28 Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to announce his coming and for Joseph to meet him in Goshen.
Genesis 46:29 Joseph then harnessed his chariot and went up to meet his father in Goshen. As soon as he saw him, he rushed to embrace him, and wept while holding him.
Genesis 46:30 And Israel said to Joseph, 'Now I will be glad to die, since I have seen your face, and I leave you alive and well.'
Genesis 46:31 Then Joseph said to his brothers and to all his father's household, 'I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and I will say to him: My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.'
Genesis 46:32 And these men are shepherds of sheep; they are keepers of livestock. They have brought their flocks, their herds, and everything they possess with them.
Genesis 46:33 So when Pharaoh calls you and asks, 'What is your occupation?'
Genesis 46:34 You shall answer: 'Your servants have been shepherds from our youth until now, both we and our fathers.' You must say this so that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, because all shepherds are an abomination to the Egyptians.
Genesis 47:1 Joseph then arrived and informed Pharaoh, saying, "My father and my brothers, with their sheep, their herds, and all their possessions, have come from the land of Canaan. Look, they are now settled in the land of Goshen."
Genesis 47:2 And he presented five of his brothers before the king.
Genesis 47:3 Pharaoh asked them, "What is your work?" They answered, "Your servants are shepherds of sheep, both we and our fathers before us."
Genesis 47:4 They added, "We have come to live in your land, for your servants' flocks can find no pasture in Canaan because the famine is very severe. We therefore ask you to command your servants to settle in the land of Goshen."
Genesis 47:5 Pharaoh then said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you."
Genesis 47:6 The land of Egypt is before you. Make them live in the very best area, and give them the land of Goshen. And if you know there are any capable men among them, appoint them as overseers of my own livestock.
Genesis 47:7 Joseph then brought his father Jacob and presented him before the king, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
Genesis 47:8 Pharaoh asked him, "How many are the days of the years of your life?"
Genesis 47:9 Jacob answered, "The days of my pilgrimage have been one hundred and thirty years. They have been few and difficult, and they have not reached the length of the years of my fathers' lives during which they sojourned."
Genesis 47:10 And blessing the king again, he departed.
Genesis 47:11 Joseph then gave his father and his brothers a possession in Egypt, in the very best places of the land, in the land of Rameses, just as Pharaoh had commanded.
Genesis 47:12 And he nourished them and his entire father's household, providing food for each one.
Genesis 47:13 In all the land, bread was lacking, and the famine prevailed throughout the world. Both Egypt and the land of Canaan were failing due to the scarcity of food.
Genesis 47:14 Joseph purchased all the money of the Egyptians and Canaanites from them in exchange for the grain they bought. And he gathered all that money into the king's treasury.
Genesis 47:15 When the money ran out, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, "Give us food! Why should we die before you, now that our money has failed?"
Genesis 47:16 He replied to them, "Give your livestock, and I will give you food."
Genesis 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph. And he gave them food in exchange for their horses, sheep, cattle, and donkeys. He sustained them for that entire year by exchanging their livestock for food.
Genesis 47:18 They came again in the second year, saying, "We cannot hide from our lord that, with our money exhausted and our livestock transferred to you, we have nothing left to offer except our bodies and our land."
Genesis 47:19 "Why should we die while you watch, both we and our land? Buy us and our land with food, and we and our fields will become servants of the king. Provide for us so that we can sow seed, and not die, nor our land become desolate."
Genesis 47:20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, as each person sold their possessions because of the severity of the famine. And he made it subject to Pharaoh.
Genesis 47:21 And he moved all the people into the cities, from one end of Egypt to the other.
Genesis 47:22 The lands of the priests were exempt, for they had been given to them by the king. They also received a fixed allowance of food each year, and therefore they were not compelled to sell their possessions.
Genesis 47:23 Joseph then said to the people, "Look, as you see, Pharaoh has bought both you and your land. Take seeds for yourselves, and sow the fields."
Genesis 47:24 When you gather the harvest, you will give a fifth part to the king. The four remaining parts will be yours for seed, and for food for your families and your children.
Genesis 47:25 They answered, "Our salvation is in your hands. May our lord only look favorably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king."
Genesis 47:26 From that day until the present day, a fifth part is paid to the kings throughout all the land of Egypt, except for the land of the priests, which remained free.
Genesis 47:27 So Israel lived in Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they took possession of it, increased, and multiplied greatly.
Genesis 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years. So all the days of his life were one hundred and forty-seven years.
Genesis 47:29 As the time of his death drew near, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh, that you may show me kindness and fidelity, and not bury me in Egypt.
Genesis 47:30 But let me rest with my fathers, and carry me out of this land, and bury me in the tomb of my ancestors." Joseph answered him, "I will do as you have commanded."
Genesis 47:31 And Jacob said, "Swear to me." And Joseph swore to him. Then Israel, turning towards the head of his bed, worshipped God.
Genesis 48:1 After these things had happened, Joseph was told that his father, Jacob, was very ill. So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, and went to see him.
Genesis 48:2 And it was announced to the old man, Jacob: 'Look, your son Joseph is coming to you!' And Jacob, strengthening himself, sat up in his bed.
Genesis 48:3 And Jacob said to Joseph: 'God Almighty appeared to me in Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
Genesis 48:4 and said: 'I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make you into a multitude of peoples. And I will give this land to you and to your descendants after you, as an eternal possession.'
Genesis 48:5 Now, your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you here, they are counted as my own. Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
Genesis 48:6 But the rest of your children whom you have had after them shall be yours, and they will be named after their brothers in their inheritances.
Genesis 48:7 When I was returning from Mesopotamia, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan, on the journey itself, as I was coming to Ephrath. There was only a short distance left on the road to reach Bethlehem. Therefore, I buried her there.
Genesis 48:8 Now Jacob, seeing Joseph's sons, said: 'Who are these young men?'
Genesis 48:9 Joseph answered him: 'They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place.' And Jacob said: 'Bring them closer to me, so that I may bless them.'
Genesis 48:10 Now, Jacob's eyes were dim because of his old age, and he could not see clearly from a distance. So he brought them close to himself, kissed and embraced them.
Genesis 48:11 He said to Joseph: 'I thought I would never see your face again; but God has shown me even your descendants.'
Genesis 48:12 And when Joseph had moved his sons from their father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.
Genesis 48:13 And Joseph took Ephraim in his right hand, to place him at Jacob's left, and Manasseh in his left hand, to place him at Jacob's right, and brought both of them close to his father.
Genesis 48:14 But Jacob, extending his right hand, placed it upon the head of Ephraim, the younger brother, and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, the older brother, crossing his hands.
Genesis 48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said: 'May God, in whose presence my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me from my youth until this very day, bless them:
Genesis 48:16 May the Angel who has redeemed me from all evils bless these boys. May my name be invoked upon them, and the names of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, too. And may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.'
Genesis 48:17 Now when Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, he was displeased. So he took hold of his father's hand, wishing to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head,
Genesis 48:18 saying: 'Not like that, Father, because this one is the firstborn. Place your right hand upon his head.'
Genesis 48:19 But Jacob refused, saying: 'I know, my son, I know. He, Manasseh, will also become a people, and he will be multiplied. But his younger brother, Ephraim, will be greater than he, and his descendants will grow into a multitude of nations.'
Genesis 48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying: 'Through you, Israel will be blessed, and it will be said: 'May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.'' And he placed Ephraim before Manasseh.
Genesis 48:21 Then Jacob said to Joseph: 'Behold, I am about to die. But God will be with you, and He will bring you back to the land of your fathers.'
Genesis 48:22 'Moreover, I am giving you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.'
Genesis 49:1 Then Jacob called his sons to him, and he said to them: 'Gather around me, so I may tell you what will happen to you in the last days of history.'
Genesis 49:2 'Gather around me and listen, you sons of Jacob; listen to Israel your father.'
Genesis 49:3 'Reuben, my firstborn, you were my strength, the first fruit of my vigor, excelling in dignity and in power.'
Genesis 49:4 'You were unstable, poured out like water; you shall no longer excel, for you went up to your father’s bed and defiled my couch.'
Genesis 49:5 'Simeon and Levi are brothers, and their weapons are instruments of violence and injustice.'
Genesis 49:6 'May my soul never enter into their schemes, nor may my glory be united with their assembly, for in their rage, they killed men, and in their self-will, they destroyed walls (cities).'
Genesis 49:7 'Cursed be their anger, because it was fierce; and their indignation, because it was cruel. I will divide them throughout Jacob and disperse them within Israel.'
Genesis 49:8 'Judah, your brothers shall praise you: your hand shall be on the necks of your enemies; the sons of your father shall bow down to you.'
Genesis 49:9 'Judah is a lion's cub; you have gone up, my son, to seize the prey. You crouched down and lay like a lion, and like a lioness—who dares to rouse him?'
Genesis 49:10 'The scepter shall not be taken away from Judah, nor a ruler from his descendants, until He comes for whom it is reserved, and He shall be the expectation of the nations (the Messiah).'
Genesis 49:11 'He shall tie his donkey's colt to the vine, and his donkey to the choicest vine. He will wash his robes in wine, and his garments in the blood of grapes, signifying abundant prosperity.'
Genesis 49:12 'His eyes are brighter (more sparkling) than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk (signifying health and beauty).'
Genesis 49:13 'Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore; he shall be a haven for ships, and his border shall reach as far as Sidon.'
Genesis 49:14 'Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between two burdens (or territories).'
Genesis 49:15 'He saw that rest was good, and that the land was pleasant, so he bowed his shoulder to bear burdens, and became a servant (of tribute).'
Genesis 49:16 'Dan shall judge his people, as one of the other tribes of Israel.'
Genesis 49:17 'May Dan be a serpent by the way, a viper in the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider falls backward, acting with cunning and surprise.'
Genesis 49:18 'I await your salvation, O Lord (a sudden prayer of Jacob).'
Genesis 49:19 'Gad, a troop shall press upon him (attack him), but he shall press upon their rear (or overcome them in the end).'
Genesis 49:20 'Asher, his bread shall be rich (or abundant and fertile), and he shall yield dainties (luxurious food) for kings.'
Genesis 49:21 'Naphtali is a swift deer (or a hind let loose), uttering beautiful words (or giving good tidings).'
Genesis 49:22 'Joseph is a fruitful son, a fruitful son by a spring, a beautiful young plant whose branches run over the wall (meaning his offspring will spread far).'
Genesis 49:23 'The archers provoked him, contended with him, and shot at him with bitter arrows (representing the malice of his enemies).'
Genesis 49:24 'But his bow remained strong, and the strength of his arms was made firm by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob—from there came the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel (referring to God's protection of Joseph and a prophetic reference to Christ).'
Genesis 49:25 'The God of your father shall be your helper, and the Almighty shall bless you with blessings from the universe above (rain and dew), with blessings from the deep (springs and fertile ground) below, with blessings of the breasts and of the womb (fertility and numerous offspring).'
Genesis 49:26 'The blessings of your father are stronger than the blessings of my fathers (forefathers), reaching even to the desired summits of the everlasting hills (representing lasting and abundant prosperity).'
Genesis 49:27 'Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning, he devours the prey, and in the evening, he divides the spoils (indicating a warlike and fierce tribe).'
Genesis 49:28 'All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them, blessing each one according to his own specific blessing (or prophecy).'
Genesis 49:29 And he charged them, saying: 'I am about to be gathered to my people (to die); bury me with my fathers in the double cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite,'
Genesis 49:30 'near the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, opposite Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham purchased, along with the field, from the sons of Heth, as a burial possession (a place of rest for the family).'
Genesis 49:31 'There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there Leah was buried.'
Genesis 49:32 When he had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up onto the bed, and he died, and was gathered to his people (his ancestors who had passed on).
Genesis 50:1 Joseph saw his father was dead, and he fell upon his father's face, weeping and kissing him.
Genesis 50:2 Then he ordered his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father with spices.
Genesis 50:3 After these orders, they completed the task. Forty days passed—this was the usual custom for embalmed bodies. And all of Egypt mourned for him for seventy days.
Genesis 50:4 When the mourning period was finished, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s household, saying, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please speak to Pharaoh on my behalf:
Genesis 50:5 My father made me swear, saying, 'I am about to die. In my tomb, which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you will bury me.' Therefore, I ask to go up and bury my father, and then I will return."
Genesis 50:6 Pharaoh said to him, "Go up and bury your father, as you have sworn to him."
Genesis 50:7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went all the elders of Pharaoh's household and all the leading elders of the land of Egypt,
Genesis 50:8 along with Joseph's household, his brothers, and all his relatives. Only their little children, their flocks, and their herds, which they had left in the land of Goshen, remained behind.
Genesis 50:9 They also had chariots and horsemen in their procession, and it was a very great company.
Genesis 50:10 When they came to the Threshing Floor of Atad, which is located beyond the Jordan, they celebrated the funeral rites with great and intense lamentation, observing seven days of mourning there.
Genesis 50:11 When the inhabitants of the land of Canaan saw the mourning at the Threshing Floor of Atad, they said, "This is a profound mourning for the Egyptians." For this reason, the place was named Planctus Aegypti, which means 'Mourning of the Egyptians'.
Genesis 50:12 Thus, Jacob’s sons did just as he had commanded them.
Genesis 50:13 They carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which Abraham had bought from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field, as a burial possession facing Mamre.
Genesis 50:14 After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all the company that had gone with him.
Genesis 50:15 After their father's death, Joseph's brothers were afraid and said to one another, "What if Joseph still holds a grudge against us and repays us for all the harm we did to him?"
Genesis 50:16 So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave us this command before he died,
Genesis 50:17 'Please forgive your brothers' wickedness and the sin they committed against you.' It was indeed evil, but now we implore you to forgive this iniquity, for we are the servants of your father’s God." When he heard these words, Joseph wept.
Genesis 50:18 Then his brothers themselves came to him, prostrating themselves on the ground, and said, "We are your servants."
Genesis 50:19 Joseph answered them, "Do not be afraid. Am I in God’s place, to oppose His will?"
Genesis 50:20 You intended evil against me, but God turned it into good, so that He might exalt me as you see today, and save many people.
Genesis 50:21 Therefore, do not be afraid. I will provide for you and your little children." So he comforted them and spoke to them with kind words.
Genesis 50:22 So Joseph lived in Egypt, he and his father's household. He lived for one hundred and ten years.
Genesis 50:23 He lived to see Ephraim's children of the third generation. The children of Machir, Manasseh's son, were also born and received into Joseph's family.
Genesis 50:24 After these events, Joseph spoke to his brothers, saying, "After my death, God will certainly visit you and lead you out of this land to the land which He swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
Genesis 50:25 And he made them swear, saying, "When God visits you, make sure you carry my bones with you from this place."
Genesis 50:26 Then Joseph died, having completed the span of his life at one hundred and ten years old. And after he was embalmed with spices, he was placed in a sarcophagus in Egypt.
Exodus 1:1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who migrated into Egypt with Jacob, each one entering with his own household:
Exodus 1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,
Exodus 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
Exodus 1:4 Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
Exodus 1:5 All the descendants who came forth from Jacob were seventy in number, counting Jacob himself; Joseph, however, was already residing in Egypt.
Exodus 1:6 And so Joseph died, and all of his brothers, and all that entire generation of his relatives passed away.
Exodus 1:7 But the sons of Israel grew greatly in numbers, multiplying like seeds sown in the earth; they filled the entire land of Egypt.
Exodus 1:8 In the meantime, a new king arose over Egypt, one who did not know or remember Joseph's contributions and legacy.
Exodus 1:9 He spoke to his own people, saying, 'Look, the nation of the sons of Israel is numerous, and they are becoming stronger than we are.'
Exodus 1:10 Come, let us deal cunningly with them, lest they multiply further, and if war breaks out against us, they might join our enemies, fight against us, and then depart from our land entirely.
Exodus 1:11 Therefore, the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over them to oppress the Israelites with heavy burdens. The Israelites then built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.
Exodus 1:12 But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more the Israelites multiplied and grew. This caused the Egyptians to despise the sons of Israel even more,
Exodus 1:13 and they afflicted them with harsh servitude in every kind of work.
Exodus 1:14 They made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and bricks, and with all types of forced labor in the fields, imposing every kind of heavy agricultural work upon them.
Exodus 1:15 Then the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives—one of whom was named Shiphrah, and the other Puah—
Exodus 1:16 commanding them: 'When you attend to the Hebrew women in childbirth, and the time for delivery comes: if it is a son, you must kill him; but if it is a daughter, you may let her live.'
Exodus 1:17 However, the midwives feared God more than the king. They did not do as the king of Egypt commanded, but allowed the male children to live.
Exodus 1:18 So the king summoned the midwives and asked them, 'Why have you done this, allowing the male children to live?'
Exodus 1:19 They answered Pharaoh: 'The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are strong and give birth quickly, and they have already delivered before we midwives can even arrive to assist them.'
Exodus 1:20 Therefore, God dealt kindly with the midwives and blessed them; and the people of Israel continued to increase and grew exceedingly strong.
Exodus 1:21 And because the midwives feared God, He built up their households and gave them families of their own.
Exodus 1:22 So Pharaoh then gave a command to all his people, saying, 'Every son who is born to the Hebrews, you must throw into the Nile River; but every daughter, you may let live.'
Exodus 2:1 A man from the tribe of Levi married a woman from the very same tribe of Levi.
Exodus 2:2 She conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a healthy and beautiful child, she hid him for three months.
Exodus 2:3 When she could no longer hide him, she took a basket made of reeds and waterproofed it with tar and pitch. She placed the baby in it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the river.
Exodus 2:4 And the baby's sister stood at a distance, watching to see what would happen to him.
Exodus 2:5 Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to bathe in the river, while her attendants walked along the river's bank. When she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent one of her servants to get it. When the basket was brought to her and opened, she saw the crying baby inside. She felt compassion for him and said, "This is one of the Hebrew children."
Exodus 2:6 Then the baby's sister spoke to Pharaoh's daughter, "Do you want me to go and call a Hebrew nurse for you, so she can nurse the baby for you?"
Exodus 2:7 Pharaoh's daughter replied, "Go." So the girl went and called the baby's mother.
Exodus 2:8 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you your wages." So the woman took the child and nursed him.
Exodus 2:9 When the child had grown up, his mother gave him back to Pharaoh's daughter. She adopted him as her own son and named him Moses, explaining that she had drawn him out of the water.
Exodus 2:10 In those days, after a long time had passed, Moses went out to his people, the Hebrews. He saw their suffering and watched an Egyptian man striking one of his Hebrew kinsmen.
Exodus 2:11 He looked around carefully, and when he saw no one else was around, he struck down the Egyptian and buried him in the sand.
Exodus 2:12 The next day, when Moses went out again, he saw two Hebrew men quarreling. He said to the one who was in the wrong, "Why are you striking your fellow man?"
Exodus 2:13 The man replied, "Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?" Moses became afraid and said to himself, "How did this deed become known?"
Exodus 2:14 When Pharaoh heard this report, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh's presence and settled in the land of Midian, sitting by a well.
Exodus 2:15 The priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came to draw water and fill the watering troughs to water their father's flock.
Exodus 2:16 Other shepherds would often come and drive them away from the well. But Moses rose to their defense, and after drawing water himself, he watered their sheep for them.
Exodus 2:17 When they returned to Reuel, their father, he asked them, "Why have you come back sooner than usual today?"
Exodus 2:18 They answered, "An Egyptian man rescued us from the shepherds and even drew water for us, then watered our sheep."
Exodus 2:19 Reuel said, "Where is he now? Why did you leave him there? Go and invite him to come eat a meal with us."
Exodus 2:20 So Moses agreed and swore to stay with Reuel. Reuel then gave Zipporah, his daughter, to be Moses' wife.
Exodus 2:21 She bore him a son, whom Moses named Gershom, explaining that he had been a sojourner in a foreign land.
Exodus 2:22 Later, she bore another son, whom Moses named Eliezer, saying, "For the God of my father has been my helper, and delivered me from Pharaoh's hand."
Exodus 2:23 After a very long time, the king of Egypt died. But the children of Israel continued to groan under their oppressive labor. They cried out, and their cry for help from their labor went up to God.
Exodus 2:24 God heard their groaning and remembered His solemn covenant that He had established with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Exodus 2:25 The Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and He truly acknowledged their plight.
Exodus 3:1 Moses was shepherding the sheep belonging to Jethro, his father-in-law, who was the priest of Midian. He led the flock deep into the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
Exodus 3:2 Then the Lord God appeared to him in a flame of fire coming out of the middle of a bush. Moses saw that the bush was burning with fire, yet it was not consumed or destroyed.
Exodus 3:3 And Moses said to himself: "I will go and see this great sight, to understand why the bush does not burn away."
Exodus 3:4 When the Lord saw that Moses was moving closer to investigate, God called to him from the middle of the bush, saying: "Moses, Moses!" And Moses answered: "Here I am."
Exodus 3:5 Then God said: "Do not come any closer here. Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground."
Exodus 3:6 He continued: "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Moses covered his face because he did not dare to look directly at God.
Exodus 3:7 And the Lord God said: "I have clearly seen the suffering of my people in Egypt. I have heard their cry because of the harshness of those who are over them in their work. I know their pain,
Exodus 3:8 and so I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians and to lead them out of that land into a good and spacious land—a land flowing with milk and honey. This is the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
Exodus 3:9 The cry of the children of Israel has indeed reached me, and I have seen how the Egyptians oppress them.
Exodus 3:10 Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may lead my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.
Exodus 3:11 And Moses said to God: "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and lead the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
Exodus 3:12 God said: "I will be with you. And this will be the sign that I have sent you: When you have led the people out of Egypt, you will offer sacrifice to God on this very mountain."
Exodus 3:13 Moses then said to God: "Look, when I go to the children of Israel and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is His name?'—what shall I tell them?"
Exodus 3:14 God said to Moses: "I AM WHO I AM." He added: "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: 'The One Who Is—has sent me to you.'"
Exodus 3:15 God also said to Moses: "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: 'The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is My name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations.
Exodus 3:16 Go and gather the elders of Israel. Tell them: 'The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying: I have indeed visited you and seen everything that has happened to you in Egypt.
Exodus 3:17 And I have said that I will lead you out of the afflictions of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.'
Exodus 3:18 They will listen to your voice. Then you and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and tell him: 'The Lord God of the Hebrews has summoned us. Let us go on a journey of three days into the wilderness, so that we may offer sacrifice to the Lord our God.'
Exodus 3:19 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, unless it is by a mighty hand.
Exodus 3:20 For I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders, which I will perform in their midst. And after these things, he will let you go.
Exodus 3:21 I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that when you depart, you will not leave empty-handed.
Exodus 3:22 Instead, you will plunder the Egyptians. You will take from them silver articles and gold articles, and clothing. You will put these upon your sons and your daughters, and thus you will strip Egypt of its riches.
Exodus 4:1 Moses answered the Lord, saying: "They will not believe me, nor will they listen to what I say. Instead, they will insist: 'The Lord never appeared to you.'"
Exodus 4:2 The Lord then asked Moses: "What is that you are holding in your hand?" Moses answered: "A staff."
Exodus 4:3 And the Lord said: "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it down, and it turned into a serpent. Moses immediately fled from it.
Exodus 4:4 Then the Lord said: "Reach out your hand and grasp its tail." Moses stretched out his hand, seized it, and held it. The serpent then returned to being a staff in his hand.
Exodus 4:5 The Lord said: "Do this so that they may believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has truly appeared to you."
Exodus 4:6 The Lord spoke again, saying: "Now, put your hand inside your cloak." When Moses placed his hand inside, he pulled it out, and it was leprous, white as snow.
Exodus 4:7 And He said: "Put your hand back into your cloak." Moses put it back, and when he drew it out of his cloak, it was restored, just like his other flesh.
Exodus 4:8 The Lord said: "If they do not believe you, nor listen to the message of the first sign, they will then believe the message of the second sign."
Exodus 4:9 "But if they do not believe even these two signs, nor listen to your voice, then take water from the river and pour it on the dry ground. What you draw from the river will turn into blood."
Exodus 4:10 Moses said: "Oh, please, Lord! I am not an eloquent speaker. I haven't been from yesterday, nor the day before, and not even since you began speaking to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."
Exodus 4:11 The Lord said to him: "Who gave humans their mouths? Or who made them mute or deaf, or able to see or blind? Was it not I, the Lord?"
Exodus 4:12 "Now, go! I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you are to say."
Exodus 4:13 But Moses replied: "Oh, please, Lord! Send someone else to whom you intend to send."
Exodus 4:14 The Lord became angry with Moses and said: "Is not Aaron, your brother, a Levite? I know that he is eloquent. Look, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad."
Exodus 4:15 "Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will show both of you what you must do."
Exodus 4:16 "He will speak for you to the people, and he will be your mouth. You, in turn, will be like God for him, guiding him in what pertains to God."
Exodus 4:17 "Also, take this staff in your hand, with which you will perform the miraculous signs."
Exodus 4:18 Moses went and returned to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said to him: "I need to go back to my brothers in Egypt to see if they are still alive." Jethro said to him: "Go in peace."
Exodus 4:19 The Lord then said to Moses in Midian: "Go, and return to Egypt, for all those who sought to kill you are dead."
Exodus 4:20 So Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon a donkey. He returned to Egypt, carrying the staff of God in his hand.
Exodus 4:21 And the Lord said to Moses: "When you return to Egypt, be sure to perform all the wonders that I have put in your power before Pharaoh. However, I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go."
Exodus 4:22 "And you shall say to him: 'Thus says the Lord: Israel is My firstborn son.'"
Exodus 4:23 "'Let My son go, so that he may serve Me. If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.'"
Exodus 4:24 It came to pass on the way, at a lodging place, that the Lord met Moses and intended to kill him.
Exodus 4:25 Immediately, Zipporah took a sharp flint knife and circumcised the foreskin of her son. She then touched Moses' feet with it and said: "You are a bridegroom of blood to me."
Exodus 4:26 So the Lord departed from him. For after she spoke the words "bridegroom of blood," the Lord immediately let him go.
Exodus 4:27 And the Lord said to Aaron: "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So Aaron went, and he met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
Exodus 4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which He had sent him, and all about the miraculous signs which He had commanded him to perform.
Exodus 4:29 So Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel.
Exodus 4:30 And Aaron spoke all the words that the Lord had said to Moses, and he performed the miraculous signs before the people.
Exodus 4:31 And the people believed. They heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel and had seen their affliction, and they bowed down and worshipped.
Exodus 5:1 After these events, Moses and Aaron came and spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "The Lord, the God of Israel, says this: Release my people, so they may offer a sacrifice to me in the desert."
Exodus 5:2 But Pharaoh replied, "Who is the Lord that I should listen to His voice and release Israel? I do not know the Lord, and I will not release Israel."
Exodus 5:3 Moses and Aaron said to him, "The God of the Hebrews has called upon us to go a three-day journey into the desert, to offer sacrifice to the Lord our God. We must do this, lest He strike us with plague or with the sword."
Exodus 5:4 Pharaoh replied to them, "Why, Moses and Aaron, do you distract the people from their labors? Go back to your own burdens."
Exodus 5:5 Pharaoh then said, "Look, the people of the land are numerous, as you can see. Think how much worse it will be if they stop working."
Exodus 5:6 Therefore, on that very day, Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over the people and their foremen, saying:
Exodus 5:7 "You will no longer give straw to the people for making bricks, as you did before. Instead, they must go and gather straw for themselves."
Exodus 5:8 "And you will impose upon them the same quota of bricks that they previously made; you are not to reduce it in any way. For they are idle, and because of this, they cry out, saying, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'"
Exodus 5:9 "Let the men's work be made heavier, and let them complete it; and let them not pay attention to false words."
Exodus 5:10 So the taskmasters and foremen went out to the people and said, "Thus says Pharaoh: I will not give you straw."
Exodus 5:11 "Go yourselves and gather straw wherever you can find it. Nevertheless, your quota of the former work will not be reduced at all."
Exodus 5:12 So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather straw.
Exodus 5:13 And the taskmasters urged them on, saying, "Complete your daily work, just as before, when you were given straw."
Exodus 5:14 So the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had appointed over them, were beaten. The taskmasters asked them, "Why have you not completed the required number of bricks today, just as yesterday and the day before yesterday?"
Exodus 5:15 Then the foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you treat your servants in this manner?"
Exodus 5:16 "Straw is not given to us, yet bricks are still demanded from us. Behold, your servants are beaten with whips, and we are treated unjustly."
Exodus 5:17 Pharaoh replied, "You are idle, and because of this, you say, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to the Lord.'"
Exodus 5:18 "Go now and work. Straw will not be given to you, but you must complete the required number of bricks."
Exodus 5:19 The foremen of the sons of Israel saw themselves in trouble, because they were told, "Nothing will be reduced from the original number of bricks required each day."
Exodus 5:20 And as they came out from Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron, who were standing there waiting for them.
Exodus 5:21 And they said to them, "May the Lord see and judge! For you have made our name foul before Pharaoh and his servants, and you have put a sword in their hands to kill us."
Exodus 5:22 Then Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Lord, why have you afflicted this people? Why did you send me?"
Exodus 5:23 "For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has afflicted Your people, and You have not delivered them."
Exodus 6:1 But the Lord said to Moses, "Now you will see what I am about to do to Pharaoh. For by My strong hand, Pharaoh will be compelled to drive the Israelites out, and with a mighty arm, he will expel them from his land."
Exodus 6:2 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the Lord, God Almighty."
Exodus 6:3 And I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but My name, YHWH, in its full meaning and power, I did not fully reveal to them.
Exodus 6:4 And I established My covenant with them, promising to give them the land of Canaan—the land where they lived as sojourners and strangers.
Exodus 6:5 Therefore, I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have remembered My covenant.
Exodus 6:6 Therefore say to the children of Israel: 'I am the Lord, who will lead you out from under the heavy burdens imposed by the Egyptians. I will rescue you from slavery, and I will redeem you with My powerful, outstretched arm, and I will execute great judgments upon Egypt.'
Exodus 6:7 And I will take you to Myself as My own people, and I will be your God. You will know for certain that I am the Lord your God, who has led you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
Exodus 6:8 And I will bring you into the land for which I solemnly swore to give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give that land to you as your possession. I am the Lord.
Exodus 6:9 So Moses told all these things to the children of Israel, but they would not listen to him because of their deep discouragement and the harshness of their labor.
Exodus 6:10 Then the Lord spoke to Moses again, saying:
Exodus 6:11 "Go and speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, telling him to let the children of Israel leave his land."
Exodus 6:12 Moses replied before the Lord, "Look, the children of Israel themselves do not listen to me. So how will Pharaoh possibly listen to me, especially since I am a man of 'uncircumcised lips'—meaning my speech is ineffective or halting?"
Exodus 6:13 And the Lord spoke to both Moses and Aaron, giving them a specific command for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt: that they were to lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus 6:14 These are the heads of the tribal families by their ancestral houses. The sons of Reuben, who was Israel's firstborn, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
Exodus 6:15 These are the clans descended from Reuben. The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, who was the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the families descended from Simeon.
Exodus 6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi, according to their clans: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived for one hundred thirty-seven years.
Exodus 6:17 The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, by their respective clans.
Exodus 6:18 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath himself lived for one hundred thirty-three years.
Exodus 6:19 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of Levi according to their family lines.
Exodus 6:20 Amram took Jochebed, his father's sister, as his wife. She bore him Aaron and Moses, as well as their sister Miriam. Amram lived for one hundred thirty-seven years.
Exodus 6:21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
Exodus 6:22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
Exodus 6:23 Aaron took as his wife Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon. She bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
Exodus 6:24 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the clans that descended from Korah.
Exodus 6:25 Furthermore, Eleazar, Aaron's son, took a wife from the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the Levitical families according to their clans.
Exodus 6:26 These are the very Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord gave the command to lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, organized by their divisions.
Exodus 6:27 These are the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. This refers to the very Moses and Aaron mentioned previously.
Exodus 6:28 On the day that the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt—
Exodus 6:29 —the Lord spoke to him, saying, "I am the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, everything that I tell you."
Exodus 6:30 But Moses said before the Lord, "Look, I am a man of 'uncircumcised lips,' meaning my speech is ineffective. How then will Pharaoh possibly listen to me?"
Exodus 7:1 The Lord said to Moses, "Listen, I have made you like a god to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet."
Exodus 7:2 You will speak everything I command you, and Aaron, your brother, will speak for you, so that he may lead the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
Exodus 7:3 But I will make Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and I will multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
Exodus 7:4 He will not listen to you, so I will stretch out My hand over Egypt and bring out My army—My people, the children of Israel—from the land of Egypt through very great acts of judgment.
Exodus 7:5 And the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I stretch out My hand over Egypt and bring the children of Israel out from among them.
Exodus 7:6 So Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded.
Exodus 7:7 Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron was eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
Exodus 7:8 The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Exodus 7:9 "When Pharaoh says to you, 'Show a sign,' you will say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, and it will turn into a serpent.'"
Exodus 7:10 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the Lord had commanded. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it turned into a serpent.
Exodus 7:11 But Pharaoh called for his wise men and his sorcerers. And the Egyptian magicians also did the same thing with their enchantments and secret arts.
Exodus 7:12 For each of them threw down his staff, and they also turned into serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
Exodus 7:13 And Pharaoh's heart grew stubborn, and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.
Exodus 7:14 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuses to let the people go."
Exodus 7:15 "Go to Pharaoh in the morning. He will be going out to the waters—to the Nile River—and you will stand to meet him on the riverbank. Take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent."
Exodus 7:16 "And you will say to him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying: "Let My people go, so that they may sacrifice to Me in the desert." But up until now, you have refused to listen.'"
Exodus 7:17 "Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'By this, you will know that I am the Lord. Behold, I will strike the water of the river with the staff that is in My hand, and it will turn into blood.'"
Exodus 7:18 "And the fish in the river will die, and the water will become foul and rot, and there will be a stench throughout Egypt. The Egyptians will not be able to drink the water from the river."
Exodus 7:19 The Lord also said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers, over their canals, over their marshes, and over all their pools of water—so that they may turn into blood. Let there be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in wooden vessels and in stone vessels.'"
Exodus 7:20 So Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded. Aaron lifted up his staff and struck the waters of the river before Pharaoh and his servants, and all the waters of the river turned into blood.
Exodus 7:21 And the fish that were in the river died, and the water became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink the water from the river. There was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
Exodus 7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments. So Pharaoh's heart grew stubborn again, and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.
Exodus 7:23 And Pharaoh turned away and went into his house, and he did not even take this to heart this time.
Exodus 7:24 But all the Egyptians dug wells around the river to get water to drink, for they could not drink the water from the river.
Exodus 7:25 And seven days passed after the Lord struck the river.
Exodus 7:26 The Lord said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'This is what the Lord says: Let My people go, so that they may sacrifice to Me.'"
Exodus 7:27 "But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will strike all your territory with frogs."
Exodus 7:28 "And the river will swarm with frogs, which will come up and enter your house, your bedroom, and your bed, and the houses of your servants and your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls."
Exodus 7:29 "And the frogs will come up on you, and on your people, and on all your servants."
Exodus 7:30 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the canals, and over the marshes, and bring up frogs upon the land of Egypt.'"
Exodus 7:31 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came out and covered all the land of Egypt.
Exodus 7:32 And the magicians did the same thing with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus 7:33 Pharaoh then called Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to the Lord that He may remove the frogs from me and from my people. Then I will let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord."
Exodus 7:34 Moses said to Pharaoh, "Set a time for me, when I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, so that the frogs may be driven away from you and from your houses and remain only in the river."
Exodus 7:35 Pharaoh answered, "Tomorrow." And Moses said, "It will be as you say, so that you may know that there is no one else like the Lord our God."
Exodus 7:36 "And the frogs will withdraw from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They will remain only in the river."
Exodus 7:37 Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to the Lord concerning the frogs, according to the promise he had made to Pharaoh.
Exodus 7:38 And the Lord did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died in the houses, in the villages, and in the fields.
Exodus 7:39 And they gathered them together in immense heaps, and the land became foul with their stench.
Exodus 7:40 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, his heart grew stubborn, and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.
Exodus 8:1 The Lord then gave Moses another command: "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the Lord declares: Let My people go so they can offer sacrifices to Me.'"
Exodus 8:2 "But if you refuse to let them go, understand that I will strike all your territories with a plague of frogs."
Exodus 8:3 The Nile River will swarm with frogs, and they will crawl out and enter your palace, your bedroom, and even your bed. They will invade the homes of your officials and your people, and get into your ovens and your kneading bowls where you prepare food.
Exodus 8:4 The frogs will cover you, your people, and all your servants everywhere.
Exodus 8:5 The Lord then told Moses, "Command Aaron: 'Stretch out your hand over the rivers, canals, and ponds, and bring forth the frogs upon the land of Egypt.'"
Exodus 8:6 Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs emerged, covering the entire land of Egypt.
Exodus 8:7 The Egyptian magicians, using their secret arts, also attempted to do the same and managed to bring forth frogs upon the land of Egypt through their dark magic.
Exodus 8:8 Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and pleaded with them: "Pray to the Lord to remove these frogs from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord."
Exodus 8:9 Moses said to Pharaoh, "You name the time when I should pray for you, your servants, and your people, that the frogs may be removed from you and your homes, remaining only in the Nile River."
Exodus 8:10 Pharaoh replied, "Tomorrow." Moses then responded, "It will be according to your word, so you may know that there is no other God like the Lord our God."
Exodus 8:11 "The frogs will be removed from you, your homes, your servants, and your people; they will remain only in the Nile River itself."
Exodus 8:12 After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the Lord concerning the plague of frogs that Pharaoh had agreed to have removed.
Exodus 8:13 The Lord acted according to Moses' request: the frogs died in the houses, in the villages, and in the fields—everywhere they had been.
Exodus 8:14 The Egyptians gathered them into enormous piles, and the land became foul with the stench of decaying frogs.
Exodus 8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief from the plague, he hardened his heart once again and refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had foretold.
Exodus 8:16 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Command Aaron: 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground, and it will become gnats throughout the entire land of Egypt.'"
Exodus 8:17 They did as commanded. Aaron stretched out his hand, holding his staff, and struck the dust of the ground. Gnats then appeared on people and animals; all the dust of the ground was transformed into gnats throughout the whole land of Egypt.
Exodus 8:18 The magicians also tried to produce gnats using their secret spells, but they could not. The gnats continued to infest both people and animals.
Exodus 8:19 The magicians finally confessed to Pharaoh, "This is the very finger of God at work here." Yet Pharaoh's heart remained stubborn, and he refused to listen to them, just as the Lord had foretold.
Exodus 8:20 The Lord then told Moses, "Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he goes out to the water—which he often did for religious rituals. Say to him: 'This is what the Lord declares: Let My people go so they can offer sacrifices to Me.'"
Exodus 8:21 "But if you do not let My people go, then I will send swarms of various kinds of flies upon you, your officials, your people, and into your houses. The homes of the Egyptians will be filled with these swarms of flies, and the very ground where they stand will be covered with them."
Exodus 8:22 "But on that day, I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people reside, so that no swarms of flies will be found there. This way you will know that I, the Lord, am present in the midst of this land."
Exodus 8:23 "I will make a clear distinction between My people and your people. This sign will happen tomorrow."
Exodus 8:24 The Lord did exactly as He said: immense swarms of flies invaded Pharaoh's palace and his officials' homes, and the entire land of Egypt. The land was devastated by these swarms of flies.
Exodus 8:25 Pharaoh then called for Moses and Aaron and said to them, "Go, and offer sacrifices to your God here within this land of Egypt."
Exodus 8:26 Moses replied, "That cannot be done, because the sacrifices we offer to the Lord our God are an abomination to the Egyptians—they consider our sacred animals as idols. If we were to openly sacrifice what the Egyptians worship, they would surely stone us to death."
Exodus 8:27 "We must travel three days into the wilderness and offer sacrifices to the Lord our God there, as He has commanded us to do."
Exodus 8:28 Pharaoh then said, "I will indeed let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the wilderness, but you must not go too far. And be sure to pray for me."
Exodus 8:29 Moses answered, "Look, I am leaving your presence now, and I will pray to the Lord that the swarms of flies may be removed from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people tomorrow. But let Pharaoh not deceive us again by refusing to let the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord."
Exodus 8:30 So Moses left Pharaoh's presence and prayed to the Lord.
Exodus 8:31 The Lord acted according to Moses' word and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. Not a single fly remained.
Exodus 8:32 But even on this occasion, Pharaoh hardened his heart and still refused to let the people go.
Exodus 9:1 So Moses went in to Pharaoh and spoke to him, saying, "This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrew people, declares: Let My people go, so they can offer Me proper public worship."
Exodus 9:2 But if you refuse to let them go, and you continue to detain them, then behold, My power will be against all your possessions: your fields, your horses, your donkeys, your camels, your cattle, and your sheep. A very severe plague of disease will strike them.
Exodus 9:3 And the Lord will show a powerful distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of the Egyptians. Nothing belonging to the children of Israel will die from this disease.
Exodus 9:4 The Lord set a specific time, saying, "Tomorrow the Lord will bring about this event in the land."
Exodus 9:5 So the Lord did this the next day. All the animals belonging to the Egyptians died from the disease, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not a single one died.
Exodus 9:6 Pharaoh sent servants to investigate, and indeed, not one of the animals belonging to Israel had died. But Pharaoh's heart became even more hardened, and he did not let the people go.
Exodus 9:7 Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of ash from a furnace, and let Moses throw it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh."
Exodus 9:8 And it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt. It will turn into festering boils breaking out on people and animals throughout the entire land of Egypt.
Exodus 9:9 So they took ash from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses threw it toward the sky, and festering boils broke out on people and animals.
Exodus 9:10 The magicians, who used occult practices, could not even stand before Moses because of the boils that had broken out on them. The boils were on them and on all the people of Egypt.
Exodus 9:11 And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so he did not listen to them, just as the Lord had told Moses would happen.
Exodus 9:12 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him: 'This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrew people, says: Let My people go, so they can offer Me proper public worship.'
Exodus 9:13 For at this time I will send all My plagues against your heart, and against your servants, and against your people, so that you may know there is no one like Me in all the earth.
Exodus 9:14 For if I had by now stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with the plague that killed the livestock, you would have been wiped off the earth completely.
Exodus 9:15 But it is for this reason that I have preserved you and kept you alive—so that I may display My power in you, and that My Name may be proclaimed throughout all the earth.
Exodus 9:16 You are still holding My people captive, and you refuse to let them go.
Exodus 9:17 Listen: tomorrow, about this time, I will cause a very heavy hailstorm to fall, such as has never occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
Exodus 9:18 Therefore, send word now and gather your livestock and everything you have in the open fields. For every person and animal that is found outside and not brought under shelter will be struck by the hail, and they will die.
Exodus 9:19 Those among Pharaoh's servants who feared the word of the Lord quickly brought their own servants and their livestock into their homes for shelter.
Exodus 9:20 But those who disregarded the word of the Lord left their servants and their livestock out in the fields.
Exodus 9:21 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, so that hail may fall throughout all the land of Egypt, upon people, upon animals, and upon every plant in the fields across the land of Egypt."
Exodus 9:22 So Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the Lord sent thunder, and hail, and lightning flashed across the land. The Lord caused rain to fall heavily upon the land of Egypt.
Exodus 9:23 There was hail, and fire was mingled with the hail. This hailstorm was so immense and destructive that nothing like it had ever appeared in all the land of Egypt since that nation was founded.
Exodus 9:24 The hail struck down everything that was in the open fields throughout the entire land of Egypt, from people to animals. The hail also destroyed every plant in the region and shattered every tree in the fields.
Exodus 9:25 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were living, did the hail not fall.
Exodus 9:26 Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, saying to them, "I have sinned this time. The Lord is righteous and just, and I and my people are wicked."
Exodus 9:27 Pray to the Lord, that He may stop these powerful thunders and this hail. I will let you go; you will not remain here any longer."
Exodus 9:28 Moses replied, "As soon as I leave the city, I will stretch out my hands in prayer to the Lord. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth belongs to the Lord."
Exodus 9:29 However, we know that neither you nor your servants truly fear the Lord God yet.
Exodus 9:30 Thus, the hail and the lightning continued. This was because the barley and the flax crops were already in their growing season—the flax was in bloom, and the barley had already formed its heads.
Exodus 9:31 But the wheat and the spelt were planted later in the season, and therefore they were not destroyed by the hail.
Exodus 9:32 When Moses left Pharaoh's presence and went out of the city, he stretched out his hands in prayer to the Lord. The thunder and hail ceased, and the heavy rain no longer poured down upon the earth.
Exodus 9:33 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, his heart became hardened once more. Both he and his servants became stubborn and unyielding.
Exodus 9:34 So Pharaoh did not let the children of Israel go, just as the Lord had declared through Moses.
Exodus 10:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses: 'Go in to Pharaoh, for I have made his heart and the hearts of his servants stubborn, so that I may perform these miraculous signs of Mine among them.'
Exodus 10:2 and so that you may recount in the hearing of your sons and your grandsons how many times I have struck the Egyptians, and the miraculous signs that I have performed among them; and so that you may know that I am the Lord.'
Exodus 10:3 Therefore, Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of the Hebrews: "How long will you refuse to submit to Me? Let My people go, so that they may offer sacrifice to Me."'
Exodus 10:4 'But if you still refuse to submit and will not let them go, behold, tomorrow I will bring the locust into your lands.'
Exodus 10:5 'These locusts will cover the surface of your land, so that nothing of it can be seen; and they will devour whatever remained after the hail, and whatever is left of your trees.'
Exodus 10:6 'They will fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants, and of all the Egyptians. Such a plague has never been seen by your fathers or your grandfathers, from the day they were born upon the earth until this very day.' And then Moses turned and left Pharaoh's presence.
Exodus 10:7 Pharaoh's servants then said to him: 'How long will we endure this scandal? Let the men go, so that they may offer sacrifice to the Lord their God. Do you not realize that Egypt is utterly ruined?'
Exodus 10:8 So Moses and Aaron were called back to Pharaoh, and he said to them: 'Go, offer sacrifice to the Lord your God. But tell me, who exactly are those who will go?'
Exodus 10:9 To him Moses replied: 'We will go with our young children and our elders, with our sons and our daughters, with all our sheep and our cattle; for it is a solemn feast of the Lord our God.'
Exodus 10:10 Pharaoh replied: 'May the Lord be with you! As for me, in what way would I ever let you go, you and your little ones? Beware, for danger is imminent!'
Exodus 10:11 'Not so! Only the men among you are to go and offer sacrifice to the Lord, for that is what you yourselves requested.' And Pharaoh's guards then drove them out from his presence.
Exodus 10:12 The Lord then said to Moses: 'Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, and let the locusts come up upon it and devour all the vegetation of the land, whatever remained after the hail.'
Exodus 10:13 So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt; and the Lord brought a scorching wind from the south throughout that entire day and night. And when morning came, the scorching wind carried the locusts.
Exodus 10:14 The locusts covered the entire surface of Egypt, settling in all the regions of the Egyptians in such countless numbers that there had never been such a plague before that time, nor will there ever be one like it again.
Exodus 10:15 Therefore, they devoured all the vegetation of the land, and whatever fruit was on the trees, and even the bark of the trees. Nothing green at all remained in all of Egypt, neither on the trees nor in the plants of the land.
Exodus 10:16 For this reason, Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron, and he said: 'I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.'
Exodus 10:17 'Now therefore, I beg you, forgive this wickedness of mine, and pray to the Lord your God, that He may at least take away this deadly plague from me.'
Exodus 10:18 So Moses left Pharaoh's presence and prayed to the Lord.
Exodus 10:19 And immediately the Lord sent a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea. Not even one locust remained in all the regions of Egypt.
Exodus 10:20 But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he refused to let the children of Israel go.
Exodus 10:21 The Lord then said to Moses: 'Stretch out your hand toward the sky, so that there may be a darkness over the land of Egypt so dense that it can be felt.'
Exodus 10:22 Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and a horrible darkness covered all the land of Egypt for three days.
Exodus 10:23 No one could see his brother, nor did anyone move from the place where he was for three days. However, where the children of Israel were, there was light.
Exodus 10:24 Pharaoh then called Moses and said: 'Go, offer sacrifice to the Lord. Only your sheep and your cattle must remain behind; your young children may go with you.'
Exodus 10:25 Moses replied: 'No, you must also provide us with burnt offerings and sacrificial animals, which we may offer to the Lord our God.'
Exodus 10:26 'We will take all our livestock with us; not a single hoof will remain. For it is necessary for us to take from them for the worship of the Lord our God, and we do not know exactly what will be pleasing to Him until we arrive at the appointed place.'
Exodus 10:27 But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he refused to let them go.
Exodus 10:28 Pharaoh then said to Moses: 'Get away from me! See to it that you never again seek my presence. On whatever day you appear before me again, you will surely die!'
Exodus 10:29 To him Moses replied: 'As you have spoken, I will not see your face again.'
Exodus 11:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying: 'There is one more plague I will send upon Pharaoh and Egypt. After this, Pharaoh will surely let you go. And when he finally lets you go, he will utterly drive you out of Egypt without delay.'
Exodus 11:2 Therefore, speak to all the people of Israel, so that every man asks his Egyptian neighbor, and every woman asks her Egyptian female neighbor, for articles of silver and gold.
Exodus 11:3 For the Lord will grant favor to His people in the sight of the Egyptians, so they will give them what they ask for. And Moses himself was a very great man in the land of Egypt, respected by Pharaoh's servants and by all the people.
Exodus 11:4 Then Moses declared: 'This is what the Lord says: About midnight tonight, I will go forth into the midst of Egypt.'
Exodus 11:5 And every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die: from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits upon his throne, down to the firstborn son of the servant girl who grinds at the mill, and also all the firstborn of the livestock.
Exodus 11:6 And there will be a great cry throughout the entire land of Egypt, such as has never been before, nor will there ever be again.
Exodus 11:7 But among all the children of Israel, not even a dog will bark, neither against a human nor against an animal. This is so you may know with what great miracle the Lord makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.
Exodus 11:8 And all these servants of yours will come down to me and bow before me, saying: 'Leave, you and all the people who are under your authority!' And only after this will I depart from Egypt.
Exodus 11:9 The Lord had also said to Moses: 'Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that many of My wonders may be performed in the land of Egypt.'
Exodus 11:10 Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders that are written about, in the presence of Pharaoh. But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel leave his land.
Exodus 12:1 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron while they were in the land of Egypt:
Exodus 12:2 "This month will be the beginning of your calendar months. It will be the first month of your year.
Exodus 12:3 Tell the whole community of the Children of Israel: 'On the tenth day of this month, each man is to take a lamb for his family and for his household.
Exodus 12:4 If the household is too small for a whole lamb, then the family and their nearest neighbor should share one, based on the number of people who can eat the lamb.
Exodus 12:5 The lamb must be without blemish, a male, and one year old. You may choose it from either the sheep or the goats.
Exodus 12:6 You must keep the lamb until the fourteenth day of this month. Then, the entire assembly of the Children of Israel will sacrifice it at twilight.
Exodus 12:7 And they are to take some of its blood and put it on both doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat the lamb.
Exodus 12:8 On that very night, they must eat the meat roasted over fire, along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
Exodus 12:9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water. It must be roasted over fire, including its head, legs, and internal organs.
Exodus 12:10 You must not leave any of it until morning. If anything remains, you are to burn it with fire.
Exodus 12:11 This is how you are to eat it: with your belts fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You must eat it quickly, because it is the Lord's Passover—meaning His passing over.
Exodus 12:12 For on that very night, I will pass through the land of Egypt and strike down every firstborn son in Egypt, from the firstborn of humans to the firstborn of animals. And I will execute judgments against all the false gods of Egypt, for I am the Lord.
Exodus 12:13 The blood on your houses will be a sign for you. When I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no destructive plague will touch you when I strike the land of Egypt.
Exodus 12:14 This day will be a memorial for you. You are to celebrate it as a festival to the Lord throughout your generations, observing it as a perpetual ordinance.
Exodus 12:15 For seven days, you must eat unleavened bread. On the very first day, you must remove all leaven from your houses. Anyone who eats anything leavened from the first day to the seventh day will be cut off from Israel.
Exodus 12:16 The first day will be a holy and solemn assembly, and the seventh day will also be a solemn festival. You must not do any work on these days, except for what is necessary to prepare food for everyone.
Exodus 12:17 You must observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. So you must keep this day throughout your generations as a perpetual ordinance.
Exodus 12:18 In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day of that month, you must eat unleavened bread.
Exodus 12:19 For seven days, no leaven is to be found in your houses. Anyone who eats anything leavened will be cut off from the community of Israel, whether they are a foreigner or a native-born Israelite.
Exodus 12:20 You must not eat anything leavened. In all your dwelling places, you must eat unleavened bread."
Exodus 12:21 Moses then called all the elders of the Children of Israel and said to them, "Go, select and take a lamb for your families, and sacrifice the Passover lamb.
Exodus 12:22 Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood that is in the basin, and apply some of it to the lintel and both doorposts. And none of you shall go out the door of your house until morning.
Exodus 12:23 For the Lord will pass through to strike the Egyptians. And when He sees the blood on the lintel and on both doorposts, the Lord will pass over that door and will not permit the Destroyer—God's instrument of judgment—to enter your houses to harm you.
Exodus 12:24 You must observe this command as an ordinance for you and your children forever.
Exodus 12:25 When you enter the land that the Lord will give you, as He promised, you must keep these ceremonies.
Exodus 12:26 And when your children ask you, "What is the meaning of this religious service?"
Exodus 12:27 You will tell them, "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, because He passed over the houses of the Children of Israel in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians but spared our homes." Then the people bowed down and worshipped.
Exodus 12:28 So the Children of Israel went and did exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.
Exodus 12:29 And it came to pass at the middle of that night, the Lord struck down every firstborn son in the land of Egypt—from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the captive in the dungeon, and every firstborn of the livestock.
Exodus 12:30 Pharaoh rose up in the night, along with all his servants and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry throughout Egypt, for there was not a single house where there was not one dead.
Exodus 12:31 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron during the night and said, "Get up! Go out from among my people, both you and the Children of Israel. Go, worship the Lord as you have said.
Exodus 12:32 Take your flocks and your herds, as you requested, and depart. And pray for me, too."
Exodus 12:33 The Egyptians pressed the people to leave the land quickly, saying, "We will all die if you don't go!"
Exodus 12:34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, and binding their kneading bowls in their cloaks, they carried them on their shoulders.
Exodus 12:35 The Children of Israel had also done as Moses commanded: they had asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold, and for many garments.
Exodus 12:36 And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so they gave them what they asked for. Thus, the Israelites plundered the Egyptians.
Exodus 12:37 The Children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.
Exodus 12:38 A mixed multitude of countless others also went up with them, along with a vast amount of flocks and herds and very much wealth.
Exodus 12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes from the dough they had brought out of Egypt, for it could not be leavened. This was because the Egyptians had forced them to leave so suddenly, not allowing them to delay or prepare anything else.
Exodus 12:40 Now, the dwelling of the Children of Israel, the time they had lived in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.
Exodus 13:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Exodus 13:2 “Consecrate to Me every firstborn male among the sons of Israel, whether human or animal, the first to be born from a mother’s womb; for all of them belong to Me and are Mine.”
Exodus 13:3 Moses then said to the people: “Remember this day, the day you came out of Egypt, from the house of slavery; because the Lord brought you out of that place with a strong hand, and therefore you shall not eat any leavened bread.”
Exodus 13:4 “Today you are leaving, in the month of new harvests,” (which is the month of Aviv, or Nisan, marking the beginning of the religious calendar).
Exodus 13:5 “And when the Lord has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites—the land He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you shall observe this rite of sacred feasts in this very month.”
Exodus 13:6 “For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn feast of the Lord.”
Exodus 13:7 “Only unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen among you, nor any leaven in all your territory.”
Exodus 13:8 “And you shall explain to your son on that day, saying: ‘This is done because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt, as a remembrance of His great works.’”
Exodus 13:9 “And this feast shall be like a sign on your hand, and like a reminder before your eyes, so that the law of the Lord may always be on your lips and in your mind; for the Lord brought you out of Egypt with a strong, powerful hand.”
Exodus 13:10 “You shall keep this ordinance at its appointed time, from year to year.”
Exodus 13:11 “And when the Lord has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, just as He swore to you and to your fathers, and has given it to you:”
Exodus 13:12 “You shall set apart to the Lord every firstborn male, every first offspring that opens the womb, dedicating them as consecrated to the Lord.”
Exodus 13:13 “Every firstborn of an ass you shall redeem with a sheep; but if you do not redeem it, you shall break its neck to put it to death. And every firstborn human of your sons you shall redeem by paying a price.”
Exodus 13:14 “When your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What does this mean?’ you shall answer him: ‘With a strong hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.’”
Exodus 13:15 “‘For when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man even to the firstborn of animals. Because of this, I sacrifice to the Lord every firstborn male that opens the womb, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons by paying a price.’”
Exodus 13:16 “‘And it shall be like a sign on your hand and like a memorial between your eyes, because the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong, powerful hand.’”
Exodus 13:17 So when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, though that was the shortest and nearest route; for God said, 'Lest perhaps the people change their minds if they see war, and return to Egypt.'
Exodus 13:18 Instead, God led them around by way of the desert toward the Red Sea. So the sons of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt prepared for battle, carrying their weapons.
Exodus 13:19 Moses also took the bones of Joseph with him; because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear an oath, saying: 'God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land, so you must carry my bones with you from here.'
Exodus 13:20 Then they moved on from Succoth and encamped in Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
Exodus 13:21 And the Lord went before them, to show them the way by day in a pillar of cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire, so that He might be their guide for the journey at both times.
Exodus 13:22 The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night never departed from before all the people, always guiding them.
Exodus 14:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Exodus 14:2 “Speak to the children of Israel: Tell them to turn back and make camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the Red Sea, opposite Baal-zephon. They must camp by the sea there.”
Exodus 14:3 “Pharaoh will then say about the children of Israel: ‘They are lost and wandering aimlessly in the land, and the desert has trapped them in.’”
Exodus 14:4 “And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue you. I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, so that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord.” The children of Israel then did exactly as God commanded.
Exodus 14:5 News was brought to the king of Egypt that the people had fled. Then the hearts of Pharaoh and his servants changed regarding the people, and they said: “What have we done? Why did we let Israel leave our service?”
Exodus 14:6 So Pharaoh prepared his royal chariot and took his entire army with him.
Exodus 14:7 He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots in Egypt, and all the captains of the entire army.
Exodus 14:8 And the Lord had hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel, who had departed with great confidence.
Exodus 14:9 As the Egyptians followed the Israelites' tracks, they found them encamped by the Red Sea. All of Pharaoh's horsemen, chariots, and his entire army were at Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon.
Exodus 14:10 As Pharaoh approached, the children of Israel looked up and saw the Egyptians pursuing them. They became terrified and cried out to the Lord for help.
Exodus 14:11 And they said to Moses: “Were there no graves for us in Egypt that you brought us out here to die in the wilderness? What have you done by leading us out of Egypt?”
Exodus 14:12 “Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt, saying: ‘Leave us alone so we may continue serving the Egyptians?’ It is far better for us to serve them than to die out here in the wilderness.”
Exodus 14:13 And Moses said to the people: “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and witness the Lord's mighty works that He will perform for you today. For the Egyptians you see now, you will never see them again, ever.”
Exodus 14:14 “The Lord Himself will fight on your behalf, and you only need to be silent.”
Exodus 14:15 Then the Lord said to Moses: “Why do you cry out to me? Tell the children of Israel to move forward!”
Exodus 14:16 “As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the Red Sea, and divide its waters, so that the children of Israel may walk through the middle of the sea on dry ground.”
Exodus 14:17 “And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, so that they will pursue you. I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen.”
Exodus 14:18 “Then the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, when I have been glorified through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”
Exodus 14:19 Then the Angel of God, who had been leading the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from its position in front of them and stood behind them.
Exodus 14:20 It positioned itself between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. To the Egyptians, it was a dark cloud bringing darkness, but to the Israelites, it lit up the night. Thus, for the entire night, the two camps could not approach each other.
Exodus 14:21 When Moses stretched out his hand over the Red Sea, the Lord drove the sea back with a powerful, strong wind that blew all night. He made the sea into dry land, and the waters were miraculously divided.
Exodus 14:22 The children of Israel walked into the middle of the Red Sea on dry ground, with the waters forming a wall for them on both their right and left sides.
Exodus 14:23 The Egyptians pursued them and went into the middle of the Red Sea after them—all of Pharaoh's cavalry, his chariots, and his horsemen.
Exodus 14:24 In the early morning watch, the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud upon the camp of the Egyptians and struck their army, causing great confusion.
Exodus 14:25 He caused their chariot wheels to be removed, so that they drove with great difficulty. Then the Egyptians said: “Let us flee from the Israelites, for the Lord is fighting for them against us!”
Exodus 14:26 Then the Lord said to Moses: “Stretch out your hand over the Red Sea, so that the waters may return and cover the Egyptians, their chariots, and their horsemen.”
Exodus 14:27 So, when Moses stretched out his hand over the Red Sea, it returned to its full depth at the first break of dawn. As the Egyptians fled from it, they ran straight into the returning waters. The Lord then engulfed the Egyptians in the midst of the waves.
Exodus 14:28 The waters returned and covered all the chariots and horsemen of Pharaoh's entire army that had pursued the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them survived.
Exodus 14:29 But the children of Israel had walked safely through the middle of the dry Red Sea, with the waters forming a protective wall for them on their right and on their left.
Exodus 14:30 On that day, the Lord delivered Israel from the power of the Egyptians. And the Israelites saw the dead bodies of the Egyptians lying on the seashore.
Exodus 14:31 And Israel saw the Lord's great power that He had exercised against the Egyptians. The people then revered the Lord and put their trust in the Lord and in Moses, His servant.
Exodus 15:1 Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord, saying:
Exodus 15:2 Let us sing to the Lord, for He has shown His great glory mightily; He has cast the horse and its rider into the sea.
Exodus 15:3 My strength and my praise is the Lord; He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will glorify Him. He is the God of my father, and I will exalt Him.
Exodus 15:4 The Lord is a mighty warrior; His name is the Almighty.
Exodus 15:5 He cast Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea; his finest officers were submerged in the Red Sea.
Exodus 15:6 Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power. Your right hand, O Lord, struck down the enemy.
Exodus 15:7 And in the greatness of Your glory, You overthrew Your adversaries. You sent forth Your wrath, which devoured them like stubble.
Exodus 15:8 And by the blast of Your fury, the waters were gathered together. The flowing waves stood up like a wall, and the mighty depths were congealed in the midst of the sea.
Exodus 15:9 The enemy said, 'I will pursue, and I will overtake them. I will divide the spoil; my desire will be satisfied. I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.'
Exodus 15:10 You blew with Your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
Exodus 15:11 Who is like You among the mighty ones, O Lord? Who is like You, magnificent in holiness, awe-inspiring and worthy of praise, doing wonders?
Exodus 15:12 You stretched out Your hand, and the earth swallowed them.
Exodus 15:13 You led in Your mercy the people whom You redeemed; and You carried them in Your strength to Your holy dwelling place.
Exodus 15:14 The nations heard, and they trembled. Pains seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
Exodus 15:15 Then the princes of Edom were dismayed. Dread took hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan grew rigid with fear.
Exodus 15:16 Let terror and dread fall upon them, by the greatness of Your arm. Let them become as still as a stone, until Your people pass over, O Lord—until this people passes over whom You have claimed as Your own.
Exodus 15:17 You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of Your inheritance, Your most firm dwelling place, which You, O Lord, have made. It is Your sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.
Exodus 15:18 The Lord will reign forever and beyond.
Exodus 15:19 For Pharaoh’s horses, with his chariots and his horsemen, went into the sea; and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them. But the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea.
Exodus 15:20 Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and in dances.
Exodus 15:21 And Miriam led them in song, saying: 'Let us sing to the Lord, for He has shown His great glory mightily; He has cast the horse and its rider into the sea.'
Exodus 15:22 Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the desert of Sur. They journeyed for three days through the wilderness and found no water.
Exodus 15:23 And they came to Marah, but they could not drink the waters of Marah because they were bitter. Therefore, a fitting name was given to the place, and he called its name Marah, which means 'bitterness.'
Exodus 15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, 'What shall we drink?'
Exodus 15:25 But Moses cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree. When Moses cast it into the waters, they became sweet. There the Lord established for them decrees and judgments, and there He tested him—Moses, and through him, the people of Israel.
Exodus 15:26 Saying: 'If you will diligently listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and will do what is right in His sight, and will obey His commandments, and keep all My statutes, I will bring upon you none of the diseases which I brought upon Egypt. For I am the Lord your healer.'
Exodus 15:27 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.
Exodus 16:1 They set out from Elim. The entire people of the Children of Israel came to the desert of Sin, which is located between Elim and Sinai. This happened on the fifteenth day of the second month—about a month after they had departed from the land of Egypt.
Exodus 16:2 The entire community of the Children of Israel began to murmur against Moses and Aaron while they were in the wilderness.
Exodus 16:3 And they said to Moses and Aaron, 'If only we had died by the hand of the Lord while we were in the land of Egypt! There, we used to sit by pots of meat and eat our fill of bread. Why have you brought us out into this wilderness, only to kill this entire community with hunger?'
Exodus 16:4 Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Listen, I will rain bread down for you from the sky. The people must go out and gather what is sufficient for each day, so that I may test them to see whether they will follow My law or not.'
Exodus 16:5 'But on the sixth day, they must prepare what they bring in, and it will be double what they are accustomed to gather on other days.'
Exodus 16:6 Then Moses and Aaron said to all the Children of Israel, 'This evening you will know that the Lord brought you out from the land of Egypt.'
Exodus 16:7 'And in the morning, you will see the glory of the Lord. For the Lord has heard your murmuring against Him. For who are we, that you should complain against us?'
Exodus 16:8 And Moses added, 'The Lord will give you meat to eat this evening and bread to eat your fill in the morning. This is because the Lord has heard your murmuring, with which you have murmured against Him. For who are we? Your murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord.'
Exodus 16:9 Then Moses said to Aaron, 'Say to the entire assembly of the Children of Israel: Come forward before the Lord, for He has heard your murmuring.'
Exodus 16:10 And as Aaron spoke to the entire multitude of the Children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness. And behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.
Exodus 16:11 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Exodus 16:12 'I have heard the murmuring of the Children of Israel. Speak to them, saying: This evening you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. And you will know that I am the Lord your God.'
Exodus 16:13 So, it came to pass that in the evening, quails came up and covered the entire camp. And in the morning, there was dew lying all around the camp.
Exodus 16:14 When the dew had evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness, there appeared something like fine flakes of frost upon the ground.
Exodus 16:15 When the Children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, 'Man hu?' which means: 'What is this?' For they did not know what it was.
Exodus 16:16 Then Moses said to them, 'This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat.'
Exodus 16:17 'This is what the Lord has commanded: Let each one of you gather from it as much as he needs to eat—a gomor for each person, according to the number of souls in your tents. So shall you gather it.'
Exodus 16:18 And the Children of Israel did so; some gathered more, some less.
Exodus 16:19 And they measured it by the gomor: he who had gathered more had no excess, and he who had gathered less found no shortage. Each person had gathered just enough according to what they could eat.
Exodus 16:20 And Moses said to them, 'Let no one leave any of it until morning.'
Exodus 16:21 But they did not listen. Some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul. And Moses became angry with them.
Exodus 16:22 They gathered it every morning, each person as much as they needed. But when the sun grew hot, it would melt away.
Exodus 16:23 But on the sixth day, they gathered twice as much food, two gomors for each person. And all the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.
Exodus 16:24 He answered, 'This is what the Lord has said: Tomorrow is the rest of the Sabbath, a holy day for the Lord. Whatever you need to bake, bake today; and whatever you need to boil, boil today. But whatever is left over, set aside until morning.'
Exodus 16:25 So they set it aside until morning, as Moses had commanded, and it did not become foul, nor were any worms found in it.
Exodus 16:26 Then Moses said, 'Eat it today, because today is the Sabbath of the Lord. Today you will not find any of it in the field.'
Exodus 16:27 And it happened that on the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, but they found nothing.
Exodus 16:28 Then the Lord said to Moses, 'How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and My law?'
Exodus 16:29 'See, the Lord has given you the Sabbath. That is why on the sixth day He gave you food for two days. Let each of you remain in your place; let no one go out from his place on the seventh day.'
Exodus 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
Exodus 16:31 The house of Israel called its name Manna. It was like white coriander seed, and its taste was like flour mixed with honey.
Exodus 16:32 And Moses said, 'This is what the Lord has commanded: Fill a gomor of it and keep it for your future generations, so that your descendants may know how I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.'
Exodus 16:33 Then Moses said to Aaron, 'Take an urn and put in it as much Manna as a gomor can hold, and place it beside the Testimony, so that it may be kept for your future generations.'
Exodus 16:34 As the Lord had commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it beside the Testimony for safekeeping.
Exodus 16:35 Now the Children of Israel ate Manna for forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They used this food until they reached the borders of the land of Canaan.
Exodus 16:36 Now, a gomor is the tenth part of an ephah.
Exodus 16:37 This verse is a textual error in some editions of the Clementine Vulgate, appearing here instead of Deuteronomy 14:22. It does not relate to the narrative of Exodus 16.
Exodus 16:38 This verse is also a textual error in some editions of the Clementine Vulgate, appearing here instead of Deuteronomy 14:26. It does not relate to the narrative of Exodus 16.
Exodus 16:39 This verse is also a textual error in some editions of the Clementine Vulgate, appearing here instead of Deuteronomy 15:10. It does not relate to the narrative of Exodus 16.
Exodus 16:40 This verse is also a textual error in some editions of the Clementine Vulgate, appearing here instead of Deuteronomy 28:12. It does not relate to the narrative of Exodus 16.
Exodus 17:1 The entire community of the sons of Israel then moved on. They departed from the Desert of Sin, traveling through their regular stopping places. This was all according to the command of the Lord. They made their camp in a place called Rephidim, but there was no water there for the community to drink.
Exodus 17:2 The community argued with Moses. They demanded: “Give us water so we can drink!” Moses replied to them: “Why are you quarreling with me? Why are you putting the Lord God to the test?”
Exodus 17:3 The community there became extremely thirsty due to the lack of water. And they grumbled against Moses, saying: “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Was it so you could kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?”
Exodus 17:4 Moses then cried out to the Lord God, saying: “What should I do for this community? It will be only a little while, and they will stone me to death.”
Exodus 17:5 Then the Lord God said to Moses: “Go ahead of the community, and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Also, take in your hand your staff—the very one with which you struck the Nile River—and go.”
Exodus 17:6 “Look, I will stand before you there, on the rock at Horeb. You will strike that rock, and water will flow out of it so the community can drink.” Moses did exactly as he was told, in the presence of the elders of Israel.
Exodus 17:7 And he called the name of that place Massa, which means “Testing”. He did this because the sons of Israel quarreled, and because they put the Lord God to the test, saying: “Is the Lord God truly among us, or not?”
Exodus 17:8 Amalek then came and fought against Israel in Rephidim.
Exodus 17:9 Moses said to Joshua: “Choose strong, capable men for yourself. Go out with them and fight against Amalek. Tomorrow, I will stand at the top of the hill, holding the staff of God in my hand.”
Exodus 17:10 Joshua did exactly as Moses had told him, and he fought against Amalek. Meanwhile, Moses, Aaron, and Hur climbed to the very top of the hill.
Exodus 17:11 Whenever Moses raised his hands, Israel gained the advantage. But when he lowered them even slightly, Amalek began to prevail.
Exodus 17:12 However, Moses' arms were very heavy. So they took a stone and placed it under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur supported his hands on both sides. And so it was that his hands remained raised until the setting of the sun.
Exodus 17:13 Joshua then routed Amalek and his community with the edge of the sword.
Exodus 17:14 Then the Lord God said to Moses: “Write this down as a memorial in a book, and recite it for Joshua to hear, because I will utterly blot out the name of Amalek from under the sky.”
Exodus 17:15 And Moses built an altar. He called its name “The Lord is My Exaltation”, or “The Lord is My Banner”.
Exodus 17:16 For he said: “Because a hand was lifted against the Lord God's throne, the Lord God's war will be against Amalek from generation to generation.”
Exodus 18:1 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law and the priest of Midian, heard about all the great and mighty things God had done for Moses and for His people Israel, because the Lord had led Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus 18:2 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken Zipporah, Moses' wife, after Moses had sent her away for a time.
Exodus 18:3 And Jethro also took Moses' two sons. The name of the first son was Gershom, which means 'I have been a stranger in a foreign land'.
Exodus 18:4 The name of the other son was Eliezer, which means 'For the God of my father is my helper, and He has rescued me from the hand of Pharaoh'.
Exodus 18:5 So Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with Moses' sons and his wife to Moses in the desert, where Moses had set up camp near the mountain of God.
Exodus 18:6 Jethro sent a messenger to Moses, saying, 'I, Jethro, your father-in-law, am coming to you, along with your wife and your two sons with her.'
Exodus 18:7 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law. He bowed down to him and kissed him. They asked about each other's well-being, and then they entered Moses' tent.
Exodus 18:8 Moses then recounted to his father-in-law everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for the sake of Israel, and all the hardship and troubles that had befallen them on their journey, and how the Lord had graciously delivered them from every danger.
Exodus 18:9 Jethro rejoiced greatly over all the good things the Lord had done for Israel, especially because He had delivered them from the oppressive hand of the Egyptians.
Exodus 18:10 And Jethro said, 'Blessed be the Lord, who has delivered you from the cruel hand of the Egyptians and from the powerful hand of Pharaoh, and who has rescued His people from the servitude of Egypt.'
Exodus 18:11 Now I know and fully understand that the Lord is greater than all other gods, because He has demonstrated His power against those who dealt so proudly and arrogantly with Israel.
Exodus 18:12 Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God. Aaron and all the elders of Israel came and ate a sacred meal with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.
Exodus 18:13 Now on the next day, Moses sat as judge over the people. And the people stood before Moses from early morning until late in the evening.
Exodus 18:14 When Moses' father-in-law saw all the work Moses was doing for the people, he asked, 'What is this thing you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all the people stand around you from morning until evening?'
Exodus 18:15 Moses answered him, 'It is because the people come to me to inquire about God's will and to seek a judgment from Him.'
Exodus 18:16 Whenever they have a dispute, they come to me, so that I may judge between them and make known to them the statutes of God and His laws.
Exodus 18:17 Moses' father-in-law said to him, 'The way you are handling this situation is not good; it is not efficient or sustainable.'
Exodus 18:18 'You will surely wear yourself out, and so will these people who are with you. The burden of this task is too heavy for you; you alone cannot possibly bear it.'
Exodus 18:19 'Now listen to my words, and I will give you counsel, and may God be with you as you implement it. You should continue to represent the people before God, bringing their cases and concerns to Him.'
Exodus 18:20 'You should also instruct them in God's statutes and sacred ceremonies, and show them the specific path they should walk and the work they are obligated to do.'
Exodus 18:21 'But from among all the people, you must select capable men—men who truly fear God, who are trustworthy, and who utterly hate dishonest gain and corruption. Appoint them over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.'
Exodus 18:22 'Let these men judge the people at all times. Whatever matters are too major or complex, they should refer to you, but they themselves should judge all the minor and simpler matters. This way, your burden will be lighter, as the responsibility will be shared by others.'
Exodus 18:23 'If you do this, and God so commands you to do it, then you will be able to endure this work, and all these people will be able to return to their homes in peace and with justice served.'
Exodus 18:24 Moses listened carefully to his father-in-law's voice and did everything that he had suggested.
Exodus 18:25 So Moses chose capable and virtuous men from all of Israel and appointed them as leaders over the people: leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens.
Exodus 18:26 These appointed men judged the people at all times. Whatever matters were more significant, they referred to Moses himself; only the minor cases did they judge on their own.
Exodus 18:27 Then Moses sent his father-in-law away, and Jethro returned and went back to his own land.
Exodus 19:1 In the third month after Israel had departed from the land of Egypt, on that very day, they arrived in the Sinai wilderness.
Exodus 19:2 After they had set out from Rephidim and arrived at the Sinai desert, they made their camp in that very place. There, the people of Israel pitched their tents facing Mount Sinai.
Exodus 19:3 Moses then climbed the mountain to encounter God. From the mountain, the Lord called to him, saying, "You are to speak these words to the family of Jacob, and you are to announce them to the descendants of Israel:"
Exodus 19:4 "You yourselves saw what I did to the Egyptians. You saw how I carried you safely, as if on the wings of eagles, and brought you directly to Myself."
Exodus 19:5 "Now then, if you truly listen to My voice and faithfully keep My covenant, you will become My own cherished possession from among all the nations. For the entire earth is Mine."
Exodus 19:6 "And you will be for Me a kingdom of priests—a nation set apart by God to serve Him—and a holy people. These are the words you must speak to the people of Israel."
Exodus 19:7 So Moses returned and called together the elders of the people. He then explained to them all the words and instructions that the Lord had commanded him to share.
Exodus 19:8 And all the people responded together, saying, "Everything that the Lord has spoken, we will do." Then Moses reported the people's words back to the Lord.
Exodus 19:9 The Lord said to Moses, "Listen! I am coming to you in a thick, dark cloud. This is so the people will hear Me speaking with you directly, and from that moment on, they will always believe in you." Moses had already delivered the people's words to the Lord.
Exodus 19:10 Then the Lord told him, "Go to the people and prepare them to be set apart for Me today and tomorrow. They must wash their garments."
Exodus 19:11 "And they must be ready by the third day, because on that third day, the Lord Himself will descend visibly upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people."
Exodus 19:12 "You must also set boundaries around the mountain for the people, and tell them: 'Be extremely careful not to go up on the mountain or even touch its edge. Anyone who touches the mountain will certainly be put to death.'"
Exodus 19:13 "No human hand should touch such a one, but they must be stoned or shot through with arrows. Whether it is an animal or a person, it shall not live if it touches the mountain. Only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast, then they may ascend the mountain."
Exodus 19:14 So Moses descended from the mountain to the people and oversaw their purification rites. When they had washed their garments,
Exodus 19:15 he told them, "Be ready by the third day, and during this time, do not engage in marital relations."
Exodus 19:16 On the third day, as morning dawned, suddenly there were thunderings and flashes of lightning, and a very thick cloud covered Mount Sinai. A powerful blast from a ram's horn sounded, growing louder and louder. The people who were in the camp were filled with terror.
Exodus 19:17 Moses then led the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the very foot of the mountain.
Exodus 19:18 The entire Mount Sinai was smoking because the Lord had descended upon it in fire. Smoke billowed up from it like from a furnace, and the whole mountain was violently shaken.
Exodus 19:19 The sound of the ram's horn continued to grow louder and more prolonged. Moses spoke, and God answered him with a voice that could be heard.
Exodus 19:20 The Lord descended upon the summit of Mount Sinai. From there, He called Moses to the very top of the mountain. When Moses had climbed up,
Exodus 19:21 God said to him, "Go down at once and strictly warn the people not to break through the boundaries to gaze upon the Lord, for if they do, many of them will surely perish."
Exodus 19:22 "Even the priests who regularly approach the Lord must consecrate themselves, otherwise, the Lord might strike them down."
Exodus 19:23 Moses said to the Lord, "The people cannot possibly ascend Mount Sinai, because You Yourself warned us and strictly commanded: 'Set boundaries around the mountain and make it holy.'"
Exodus 19:24 The Lord said to him, "Go down! Then you may come up again, you and Aaron with you. But the priests and the people must not break through the boundaries and ascend to the Lord, lest He strike them dead."
Exodus 19:25 So Moses went down to the people and told them all these things.
Exodus 20:1 And the Lord spoke all these commands, saying:
Exodus 20:2 “I am the Lord, your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt, out of the place of your slavery.
Exodus 20:3 You shall not have other gods besides Me.
Exodus 20:4 You shall not make for yourself any carved image, nor any likeness of anything that is in the sky above, or that is on the earth below, or that is in the waters beneath the earth.
Exodus 20:5 You shall not adore these false images, nor worship them; for I am the Lord, your God, a powerful and jealous God, who punishes the wickedness of the fathers on their children, even to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me.
Exodus 20:6 But I show mercy to thousands of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
Exodus 20:7 You shall not take the Name of the Lord, your God, in vain; for the Lord will not hold guiltless anyone who takes the Name of the Lord, his God, in vain.
Exodus 20:8 Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy.
Exodus 20:9 For six days you shall labor and do all your work.
Exodus 20:10 But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, your God; you shall not do any work on it, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your animal, nor the stranger who is within your gates.
Exodus 20:11 For in six days the Lord made the universe, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
Exodus 20:12 Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land that the Lord, your God, will give you.
Exodus 20:13 You shall not murder.
Exodus 20:14 You shall not commit adultery.
Exodus 20:15 You shall not steal.
Exodus 20:16 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
Exodus 20:17 You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not desire his wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that belongs to him.”
Exodus 20:18 Now all the people saw the thundering voices, and the lightning flashes, and the sound of the trumpet, and the smoking mountain. And being terrified and shaken with fear, they stood afar off.
Exodus 20:19 They said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but let not the Lord speak to us, lest we die.”
Exodus 20:20 And Moses said to the people, “Do not fear, for God has come to test you, and that His awe-inspiring presence might be in you, so that you do not sin.”
Exodus 20:21 So the people stood afar off, but Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
Exodus 20:22 Then the Lord said to Moses, “This is what you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen that I spoke to you from the sky.’
Exodus 20:23 You shall not make gods of silver alongside Me, nor shall you make gods of gold for yourselves.
Exodus 20:24 You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and on it you shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause My Name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.
Exodus 20:25 But if you make an altar of stones for Me, you shall not build it of cut and polished stones; for if you lift up a tool upon it, you will have defiled it.
Exodus 20:26 Nor shall you go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness may not be exposed upon it.”

Exodus 21:1 These are the legal decrees that you must present to the people of Israel.
Exodus 21:2 If you purchase a Hebrew servant, he shall serve you for six years. In the seventh year, he shall leave as a free man without having to pay anything.
Exodus 21:3 He shall leave with the same status he had when he entered service. If he entered with a wife, then his wife shall leave with him.
Exodus 21:4 But if his master gives him a wife, and she bears him sons or daughters, then the wife and her children shall remain the master's property, and the man himself shall leave alone.
Exodus 21:5 But if the servant should plainly declare, saying: 'I do not wish to leave as a free man, because I love my master, my wife, and my children; I want to remain with them.'
Exodus 21:6 Then his master shall bring him before the judges, and he shall bring him to a door or doorpost. The master shall then pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall remain his servant for the rest of his life.
Exodus 21:7 If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not leave her service as other female servants do.
Exodus 21:8 If she does not please her master, to whom she was given, he must allow her to be redeemed by her family. He does not have the power to sell her to a foreign people if he has rejected her.
Exodus 21:9 However, if he betroths her to his own son, then he must treat her with the same rights and dignity as a natural daughter.
Exodus 21:10 And if he takes another wife, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, nor her conjugal rights.
Exodus 21:11 If he does not provide her with these three things, then she shall leave as a free woman, without having to pay any money.
Exodus 21:12 Whoever strikes a man and causes his death, he shall surely be put to death.
Exodus 21:13 But if a man did not intentionally plot to kill, and God allowed the person to die by his hand accidentally, then I will designate a place for you where he may flee for safety.
Exodus 21:14 But if someone intentionally and treacherously murders his neighbor, you shall take him away from My altar, and he shall be put to death.
Exodus 21:15 Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus 21:16 Whoever kidnaps a person and sells him, and is proven guilty, shall surely be put to death.
Exodus 21:17 Whoever curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
Exodus 21:18 If men quarrel and one strikes his neighbor with a stone or with his fist, and the man does not die but is confined to his bed,
Exodus 21:19 if the injured man then rises and walks about outside, even if with a staff, the man who struck him shall not be guilty of murder. However, the assailant must pay for the injured man’s lost wages and cover all medical expenses for his full recovery.
Exodus 21:20 If a man strikes his male or female servant with a rod, and the servant dies while still under his hand, the master shall be guilty of a crime.
Exodus 21:21 However, if the servant survives for a day or two, the master shall not be punished for murder, as the servant is considered his property, and the loss of his property is a sufficient consequence for him.
Exodus 21:22 If men quarrel and one strikes a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry, but the woman herself lives, then the offender shall surely be fined. The amount of the fine shall be determined by what the woman's husband demands, and what the judges determine is just.
Exodus 21:23 But if her death also results from the injury, then it shall be 'a life for a life'—the offender shall be put to death.
Exodus 21:24 An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot,
Exodus 21:25 a burn for a burn, a wound for a wound, a bruise for a bruise.
Exodus 21:26 If a man strikes the eye of his male or female servant and permanently damages it, he must set the servant free in compensation for the eye he destroyed.
Exodus 21:27 And if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female servant, he shall likewise set them free.
Exodus 21:28 If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned to death, and its meat must not be eaten. However, the owner of the ox shall be considered innocent of the death, provided he was unaware of the ox's aggressive nature.
Exodus 21:29 But if the ox was known to be aggressive and prone to goring in the past, and its owner was warned about it yet failed to keep it securely confined, and it then kills a man or a woman, then both the ox shall be stoned to death and its owner shall also be put to death.
Exodus 21:30 However, if a ransom is imposed upon him instead of the death penalty, he shall pay whatever amount is demanded as compensation for his life.
Exodus 21:31 Whether the ox kills a son or a daughter, the owner shall be judged according to these same laws.
Exodus 21:32 If the ox kills a male or female servant, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the servant's master, and the ox itself shall be stoned to death.
Exodus 21:33 If a man opens a pit, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
Exodus 21:34 the owner of the pit shall fully compensate the animal's owner with money. The dead animal itself shall then belong to the owner of the pit.
Exodus 21:35 If one man's ox gores another man's ox so that it dies, then they shall sell the living ox and divide the money from the sale equally. They shall also divide the carcass of the dead ox.
Exodus 21:36 But if it was known that the ox was accustomed to goring in the past, and its owner did not keep it confined, then he must give an ox in full payment for the other ox. The dead ox shall then belong to the negligent owner.
Exodus 22:1 If someone steals an ox or a sheep, and then either slaughters it or sells it, he shall repay five oxen for the one ox, and four sheep for the one sheep. This law ensures a high restitution for depriving the owner of their property permanently.
Exodus 22:2 If a thief is caught breaking into a house—by tunneling through a wall or breaking in—and is struck and dies, the one who killed him will not be held guilty for his death. This law permits self-defense against burglars at night.
Exodus 22:3 But if this happens after sunrise, the homeowner will be guilty for the death. If the thief survives, he must make restitution. If he has nothing, he shall be sold into servitude to cover the cost of his theft. This distinction between night and day reflects the assumption that at night, one cannot discern the thief's intent.
Exodus 22:4 If the stolen animal—whether an ox, a donkey, or a sheep—is found alive in the thief's possession, he must restore double its value to the owner. This lesser penalty applies when the stolen item can be returned.
Exodus 22:5 If someone lets his livestock graze in a field or vineyard belonging to another, causing damage, he must make restitution with the best produce from his own field and vineyard. This ensures that the compensation is full and fair.
Exodus 22:6 If a fire starts and spreads to thorny bushes, then catches a field of grain—whether it is standing or gathered in piles—or an entire field, the person who started the fire must repay the damage. This law holds one responsible for negligence with fire.
Exodus 22:7 If someone gives money or an item to a friend for safekeeping, and it is stolen from the one who received it: if the thief is caught, he must restore double its value. This protects entrusted property.
Exodus 22:8 If the thief is not found, the owner of the house where the item was stolen from safekeeping must approach the judges—who represent God's justice—and swear an oath that he did not take the item himself. This places the matter under divine judgment.
Exodus 22:9 For every case of fraud—whether it concerns an ox, a donkey, a sheep, clothing, or any other loss—if a person is suspected but cannot prove he did not steal, he shall repay double to his neighbor. This covers various types of misappropriation.
Exodus 22:10 If someone entrusts to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any other animal for safekeeping, and it dies, is injured, or is carried off, and no one witnesses what happened:
Exodus 22:11 An oath before God shall settle the matter between them both, that the keeper did not lay a hand on his neighbor's property. The owner must accept this sworn statement, and the keeper will not be compelled to pay restitution. This relies on the keeper's integrity before God.
Exodus 22:12 But if the animal was stolen from the keeper, he must pay restitution for the loss to the owner. This indicates a higher level of responsibility for preventing theft.
Exodus 22:13 If the animal was torn apart by a wild beast, the keeper must bring the remains as proof, and he will not have to pay restitution for the loss. This acknowledges uncontrollable circumstances.
Exodus 22:14 If someone borrows an animal from a friend, and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, the borrower must certainly repay its value. This is because the borrower is solely responsible for its care.
Exodus 22:15 But if the owner was present when the injury or death occurred, the borrower is not compelled to repay. This applies especially if the animal was hired out; the rental fee itself covers the risk of loss in the presence of the owner.
Exodus 22:16 If someone seduces a virgin who is not yet promised to another man, and has relations with her, he must pay the marriage price for her and take her as his wife. This law protects the virgin's honor and ensures her future.
Exodus 22:17 If the virgin's father utterly refuses to give her to him, the seducer must still pay money equal to the customary marriage price for virgins. This serves as a penalty for his actions, even without marriage.
Exodus 22:18 You shall not allow sorcerers and witches to live. This command reflects God's strong condemnation of magic and demonic practices.
Exodus 22:19 Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must surely be put to death. This is an abomination against natural law and purity.
Exodus 22:20 Whoever sacrifices to any god except the Lord God alone shall be utterly destroyed—put to death. This is a primary commandment against idolatry.
Exodus 22:21 You shall not distress a foreigner, nor oppress him, because you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. This command calls for empathy and justice, remembering their own past experience.
Exodus 22:22 You shall not harm widows or orphans. These vulnerable groups are under God's special protection.
Exodus 22:23 If you harm them, and they cry out to me, I will surely hear their cry. This warns of God's immediate response to injustice against the vulnerable.
Exodus 22:24 And my wrath will be kindled, and I will strike you down with the sword, so your own wives will become widows and your children orphans. This is a severe warning of reciprocal divine judgment.
Exodus 22:25 If you lend money to my people, to the poor among you, you shall not act like a moneylender towards them. You shall not burden them with interest. This command prohibits usury among Israelites, especially to the poor.
Exodus 22:26 If you take your neighbor's outer garment as a pledge for a loan, you must return it to him before the sun sets. This is because the poor may need it for warmth during the night.
Exodus 22:27 For it is his only covering, the very clothing for his body; he has nothing else to sleep in. If he cries out to me, I will hear him, because I am merciful. God hears the cries of the poor and oppressed.
Exodus 22:28 You shall not revile the judges—those who represent God's authority—nor curse the ruler of your people. This command teaches respect for all authority, both divine and civil.
Exodus 22:29 You shall not delay in offering your tithes and your first fruits. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me. This refers to the dedication of the firstborn male to God, later redeemed.
Exodus 22:30 You shall do the same with your oxen and your sheep: for seven days, an offspring shall be with its mother, but on the eighth day, you shall give it to Me. This is about dedicating the firstborn animals.
Exodus 22:31 You shall be holy people to Me. You must not eat any meat that has been torn by wild beasts in the field, but you shall throw it to the dogs. This preserves ritual purity and distinction.
Exodus 23:1 You shall not accept a false report. Nor shall you join hands with a wicked person to give dishonest testimony.
Exodus 23:2 You shall not follow the crowd to do evil. Nor shall you in a lawsuit agree with the opinion of the many, if their judgment would cause you to deviate from the truth.
Exodus 23:3 You shall not show partiality to a poor person in a lawsuit.
Exodus 23:4 If you encounter the ox or donkey of your enemy straying, you must bring it back to him.
Exodus 23:5 If you see the donkey of someone who hates you lying under its burden, you shall not just pass by it, but you must help the person to lift it up.
Exodus 23:6 You shall not pervert justice against a poor person in their lawsuit.
Exodus 23:7 You shall flee from falsehood. You shall not kill an innocent and righteous person, for I abhor the wicked.
Exodus 23:8 Nor shall you accept bribes, which blind even the wise and distort the words of the righteous.
Exodus 23:9 You shall not oppress a foreigner, for you know the hearts of foreigners, because you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
Exodus 23:10 For six years you shall sow your land and gather its harvest.
Exodus 23:11 But in the seventh year, you shall let the land rest and lie fallow. This is so the poor among your people may eat from it, and whatever they leave, the wild animals of your region may devour. You shall do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
Exodus 23:12 For six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall rest. This is so your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female servant, along with the foreigner, may be refreshed.
Exodus 23:13 All that I have told you, you shall observe carefully. You shall not swear by the names of other gods, nor shall their names be heard from your mouth.
Exodus 23:14 Three times a year you shall keep a feast for Me.
Exodus 23:15 You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you shall eat no leavened bread, just as I commanded you at the appointed time in the month of Abib (which means 'new sprouts'), when you came out of Egypt. You shall not appear before Me empty-handed.
Exodus 23:16 And you shall observe the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labor, of what you have sown in the field. And you shall observe the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you have gathered all your produce from the field.
Exodus 23:17 Three times a year, all your males shall appear before the Lord, your God.
Exodus 23:18 You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall any part of the sacrifice of My feast remain until the morning.
Exodus 23:19 You shall bring the best of the firstfruits of your land into the house of the Lord, your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
Exodus 23:20 Behold, I am sending My angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.
Exodus 23:21 Be attentive to him and listen to his voice; do not rebel against him. For he will not forgive your transgressions, because My Name is in him.
Exodus 23:22 But if you diligently listen to his voice and do all that I speak to you through him, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and afflict those who afflict you.
Exodus 23:23 My angel will go before you and bring you to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, whom I will utterly destroy.
Exodus 23:24 You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them. You shall not imitate their practices, but you shall utterly break down their sacred pillars and smash their altars.
Exodus 23:25 And you shall serve the Lord, your God, so that I may bless your bread and your water, and remove sickness from your midst.
Exodus 23:26 There shall be no woman who miscarries or is barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of your days.
Exodus 23:27 I will send My terror before you and throw into confusion every people to whom you come. I will make all your enemies flee from you.
Exodus 23:28 I will send My forces before you, which will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites, before you enter the land.
Exodus 23:29 I will not drive them out from before you in a single year, lest the land become desolate and the wild animals multiply against you.
Exodus 23:30 Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you become numerous and take possession of the land.
Exodus 23:31 And I will set your boundaries from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the River (meaning the Euphrates). For I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hands, and I will drive them out from before you.
Exodus 23:32 You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
Exodus 23:33 They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against Me by serving their gods, which would become a snare to you.
Exodus 24:1 God also said to Moses: "Come up to the Lord, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy elders from Israel, and you all shall worship from a distance (as a sign of reverence for My holy presence)."
Exodus 24:2 Moses alone will ascend closer to the Lord. The others (Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders) will not come near Him, and the people will not ascend with Moses at all (maintaining a clear distinction in access to God's presence).
Exodus 24:3 So Moses came down and told the people all the words (commands and laws) of the Lord, as well as His judgments. And all the people responded with one voice, proclaiming: "All the words which the Lord has spoken, we will do (confirming their acceptance of the covenant)."
Exodus 24:4 Then Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord (the terms of the covenant). And rising early in the morning, he built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and he set up twelve stone pillars, each one representing one of the twelve tribes of Israel (symbolizing their unified presence before God).
Exodus 24:5 He then sent young men from among the children of Israel, and they offered burnt offerings (sacrifices entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God). They also sacrificed calves as peace offerings (sacrifices for fellowship and communion with God and each other) to the Lord.
Exodus 24:6 So Moses took half of the blood from these sacrifices and put it into basins. But the other half he poured over the altar (signifying atonement and consecration to God).
Exodus 24:7 Then, taking the book of the covenant (the written laws and stipulations), he read it aloud for the people to hear. And they responded, saying: "Everything that the Lord has spoken, we will do, and we will be obedient (reaffirming their solemn commitment)."
Exodus 24:8 Then Moses took the remaining blood and sprinkled it on the people. And he declared: "This is the blood of the covenant (the solemn agreement sealed by life itself) which the Lord has made with you concerning all these words (His laws and promises)."
Exodus 24:9 So Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel (the same group mentioned in verse 1, now granted a closer approach) went up the mountain.
Exodus 24:10 And they saw a manifestation of the God of Israel. Under His feet was something like a pavement made of sapphire stone, appearing as clear and blue as the sky when it is serene (a vision of divine glory, not God's essence).
Exodus 24:11 And God did not lay His hand in judgment upon these leaders who had seen this manifestation of Him, even though it was a partial viewing of the Almighty. So they saw God (in His revealed glory), and they ate and drank (participating in a covenant meal in His presence, an act of great favor).
Exodus 24:12 Then the Lord said to Moses: "Come up to Me on the mountain and stay there (for an extended period). And I will give you tablets of stone (the Decalogue, written by My own hand), containing the Law and the commandments which I have written, so that you may teach them to the people of Israel."
Exodus 24:13 So Moses rose, along with Joshua his assistant (who would accompany him part-way up the mountain). And Moses began ascending the mountain of God (Mount Sinai, where God's presence was revealed).
Exodus 24:14 He said to the elders (who remained at the foot of the mountain): "Wait here for us until we return to you. You will have Aaron and Hur with you; if any question or dispute arises among you, you shall refer it to them (as your temporary leaders)."
Exodus 24:15 As Moses ascended higher, a thick cloud covered the mountain (a visible sign of God's dwelling there and His hidden glory).
Exodus 24:16 And the glory of the Lord (His magnificent presence) dwelt (rested) upon Mount Sinai, with the cloud covering it for six days. On the seventh day, He called Moses from the midst of the thick darkness (the innermost part of the cloud where God communed directly with him).
Exodus 24:17 Now the appearance of the glory of the Lord, as visible to the children of Israel below, was like a blazing fire on the very top of the mountain (a fearsome and awe-inspiring sight).
Exodus 24:18 So Moses entered the midst of the cloud and ascended further into the mountain. And he remained there for forty days and forty nights (a profound period of fasting, communion, and divine instruction).
Exodus 24:19 The Lord spoke to Moses again (while he was on the mountain), saying:
Exodus 24:20 "Tell the children of Israel to bring Me offerings. From every person whose heart moves him to offer willingly (without compulsion), you shall accept these offerings for My sanctuary."
Exodus 24:21 "Now these are the materials you are to receive (as voluntary offerings): gold, and silver, and bronze (or copper, as a strong and useful metal)."
Exodus 24:22 "And blue fabric, and purple fabric, and scarlet fabric (dyed twice for a rich, vibrant color). Also, fine linen, and goats' hair (for durable textiles)."
Exodus 24:23 "And rams' skins dyed red, and fine leather (likely badger skins or another durable, colorful leather suitable for covering). And acacia wood (a strong, rot-resistant wood found in the desert regions)."
Exodus 24:24 "Oil for the lamps (to keep the sanctuary illuminated). Spices for the anointing oil (used to consecrate persons and objects) and fragrant incense (for worship, creating a sweet aroma before God)."
Exodus 24:25 "Onyx stones, and other precious stones for the ephod (a sacred vestment worn on the shoulders by the High Priest) and the breastplate (a ceremonial pouch worn over the chest, containing the Urim and Thummim for divine guidance)."
Exodus 24:26 "And they shall make Me a sanctuary (a holy, set-apart dwelling place). The purpose of this is so that I may dwell (make My presence known) among them (as their God and guide)."
Exodus 24:27 "You are to make it according to every exact pattern of the tabernacle (this portable dwelling of God) which I will show you, and according to the pattern of all its vessels (the sacred furnishings) for its service. This is precisely how you shall make it (emphasizing divine origin and specific design)."
Exodus 24:28 "They shall also make an ark (a sacred chest, the most important object in the Tabernacle) of acacia wood. Its length shall be two and a half cubits (approximately 45 inches). Its width shall be one and a half cubits (approximately 27 inches). And its height shall also be one and a half cubits (approximately 27 inches)."
Exodus 24:29 "You shall overlay it (the ark) with pure gold, both inside and out. And you shall make a gold molding (a decorative rim, often called a 'crown') around its upper edge (adding to its beauty and distinction)."
Exodus 24:30 "And you shall cast four gold rings, which you will place on its four feet (or corners), one on each side of the ark. Two rings shall be on one side, and two rings on the other side (providing attachment points for carrying)."
Exodus 24:31 "You shall also make poles (carrying staves) of acacia wood, and you shall overlay them with gold (matching the ark's precious material)."
Exodus 24:32 "You shall put these poles through the rings that are on the sides of the ark, so that it may be carried by them (without anyone directly touching the holy ark)."
Exodus 24:33 "These poles shall remain in the rings permanently. They shall never be removed from them (as a strict command, emphasizing the ark's sanctity and readiness for movement)."
Exodus 24:34 "And you shall put into the ark the Testimony (the two tablets of the Ten Commandments, which bear witness to God's covenant) which I will give to you (as the foundation of My covenant with Israel)."
Exodus 24:35 "You shall also make a mercy seat (or 'atonement cover') of pure gold. Its length shall be two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits (exactly matching the dimensions of the ark it will cover)."
Exodus 24:36 "You shall also make two cherubim (angelic figures, symbolizing heavenly guardians of God's presence) of hammered gold. You shall make them skillfully crafted from the two ends of the mercy seat (where God will speak, hence 'oracle')."
Exodus 24:37 "One cherub shall be on one side (of the mercy seat), and the other cherub on the other side. You shall make them to emerge seamlessly from each end of the mercy seat itself." This ensures they are an integral part of the mercy seat.
Exodus 24:38 "The cherubim shall have their wings spread upwards, covering the mercy seat with their wings (as if guarding it). And their faces shall be turned towards each other, looking reverently down towards the mercy seat (the place of divine communion and atonement)."
Exodus 24:39 "And you shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark. In that ark, you shall place the Testimony (the tablets of the Law) which I will give to you (thus the mercy seat covers the Law, signifying God's mercy over judgment)."
Exodus 24:40 "From there (from above the mercy seat), I will give commands to you. And I will speak with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are upon the ark of the Testimony (the Ark of the Covenant). There, I will give you all the commandments that I will impart through you to the children of Israel (establishing this as the central place of divine revelation and intercession)."
Exodus 25:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Exodus 25:2 Speak to the children of Israel and tell them to bring me contributions—offerings for the Tabernacle. You are to receive these gifts from everyone whose heart is willing to give.
Exodus 25:3 These are the contributions you shall receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze;
Exodus 25:4 blue-violet yarn, purple yarn, scarlet yarn that has been dyed twice, fine linen, and goat hair;
Exodus 25:5 rams’ skins dyed red, badger skins, and acacia wood;
Exodus 25:6 oil for the lamps, aromatic spices for anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, onyx stones, and other precious stones for the ephod and the breastpiece.
Exodus 25:7 oil for the lamps, aromatic spices for anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, onyx stones, and other precious stones for the ephod and the breastpiece.
Exodus 25:8 And they shall build a sanctuary for Me, so that I may dwell among them and be present with My people.
Exodus 25:9 You shall make it exactly according to all the design of the Tabernacle that I will show you, and of all its furnishings for its service. You shall make it in this way.
Exodus 25:10 You shall make an Ark from acacia wood. Its length shall be two and a half cubits, its width one and a half cubits, and its height likewise one and a half cubits.
Exodus 25:11 You shall cover it with the purest gold, inside and outside you shall cover it. You shall also make a golden crown, a molding around its upper edge, all around it.
Exodus 25:12 And you shall cast four gold rings for it, and place them on its four corners: two rings on one side, and two rings on the other side.
Exodus 25:13 You shall also make poles from acacia wood, and cover them with gold.
Exodus 25:14 You shall put the poles into the rings that are on the sides of the Ark, so that it may be carried by them.
Exodus 25:15 The poles shall remain in the rings permanently; they are not to be removed from them.
Exodus 25:16 And into the Ark you shall put the testimony—the tablets of the Ten Commandments—which I will give to you.
Exodus 25:17 You shall also make a propitiatory—a mercy seat—of the purest gold. Its length shall be two and a half cubits, and its width one and a half cubits.
Exodus 25:18 You shall make two cherubim—angelic figures—of gold. You shall make them of hammered work at the two ends of the propitiatory.
Exodus 25:19 Let one cherub be on one end and the other cherub on the other end. From the two ends of the propitiatory, you shall make the cherubim.
Exodus 25:20 The cherubim shall have their wings spread upward, covering the propitiatory with their wings, and they shall face each other, with their faces turned toward the propitiatory, which is to cover the Ark.
Exodus 25:21 You shall place the propitiatory on top of the Ark, and in the Ark you shall put the testimony—the tablets—which I will give to you.
Exodus 25:22 From there I will give you instructions, and I will speak to you from above the propitiatory—the mercy seat—and from between the two cherubim that are upon the Ark of the Testimony, concerning all that I will command you for the children of Israel.
Exodus 25:23 You shall also make a table from acacia wood. Its length shall be two cubits, its width one cubit, and its height one and a half cubits.
Exodus 25:24 You shall cover it with the purest gold, and make a golden crown—a molding—all around its edge.
Exodus 25:25 You shall make a rim all around it, a handbreadth wide, and make a golden molding for the rim around it. Also, you shall make two gold rings for it, and place them on the four corners that are on its four legs.
Exodus 25:26 The ring shall be under the rim, so that poles may be put into them, and the table may be carried.
Exodus 25:27 You shall make these poles from acacia wood and cover them with gold, so that the table may be carried by them.
Exodus 25:28 And on the table you shall always place the Bread of the Presence—the showbread—before Me.
Exodus 25:29 You shall also make its dishes, its censers, its bowls, and its jars of pure gold, in which libations—drink offerings—are to be poured.
Exodus 25:30 And on the table you shall always place the Bread of the Presence—the showbread—before Me.
Exodus 25:31 You shall also make a lampstand of pure, hammered gold. Its base and its shaft, its cups, its ornamental knobs, and its lilies shall proceed from it as one piece.
Exodus 25:32 Six branches shall extend from its sides: three branches of the lampstand from one side, and three branches from the other side.
Exodus 25:33 Three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with its ornamental knob and a lily, shall be on one branch. And similarly, three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with its ornamental knob and a lily, shall be on the next branch. This pattern applies to all six branches that extend from the lampstand's central shaft.
Exodus 25:34 And on the central shaft of the lampstand, there shall be four cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with its ornamental knob and a lily.
Exodus 25:35 There shall also be an ornamental knob under each pair of the six branches that extend from the central shaft of the lampstand.
Exodus 25:36 Their ornamental knobs and their branches shall be of one piece with the lampstand; all of it shall be one piece of pure, hammered gold.
Exodus 25:37 You shall also make its seven lamps, and set them on the lampstand so that they give light in front of it.
Exodus 25:38 Its snuffers and its trays—for the wicks and soot from the lamps—shall also be of purest gold.
Exodus 25:39 All these vessels which we have mentioned shall be made from a talent of purest gold.
Exodus 25:40 Look carefully and make them according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.
Exodus 26:1 You shall then make the Tabernacle itself—the sacred dwelling place—from ten curtains. These curtains are to be woven from fine twisted linen, along with blue, purple, and double-dyed scarlet threads, skillfully crafted with artistic designs.
Exodus 26:2 Each one of these curtains is to be twenty-eight cubits long, which is about forty-two feet, and four cubits wide, which is about six feet. All the curtains will have the exact same measurements.
Exodus 26:3 Five of these curtains are to be joined together to form one large sheet, and the other five curtains will likewise be joined together to form a second large sheet.
Exodus 26:4 You shall also make loops of blue thread along the edge of the first set of five curtains, and similar loops along the edge of the second set of five curtains, on the sides where they will be joined.
Exodus 26:5 You are to make fifty loops on the edge of one large curtain sheet, and fifty loops on the edge of the other large curtain sheet. These loops should be directly opposite each other, so that one sheet can be joined to the other.
Exodus 26:6 Then you will make fifty golden clasps. With these clasps, you will join the loops of the curtains, and in this way, the two large sheets will become one complete Tabernacle covering.
Exodus 26:7 You will also make an outer covering for the Tabernacle from eleven curtains woven from goat hair.
Exodus 26:8 Each one of these goat hair curtains is to be thirty cubits long, which is about forty-five feet, and four cubits wide, which is about six feet. All the goat hair curtains will have the exact same measurements.
Exodus 26:9 You will join five of these goat hair curtains together into one section, and the other six curtains into a second section, so that the sixth curtain in this second section will be folded over at the very front of the Tabernacle, providing extra coverage.
Exodus 26:10 You shall make fifty loops along the edge of one section of goat hair curtains, and fifty loops along the edge of the other section of goat hair curtains, so that they can be joined together.
Exodus 26:11 And you will make fifty bronze clasps, which you will use to join the loops. In this way, the two sections of goat hair curtains will form one unified roof covering.
Exodus 26:12 The surplus fabric from the goat hair covering, specifically one cubit from each side, will hang down over the sides of the Tabernacle.
Exodus 26:13 And the extra cubit of length from each end of the roof covering for the Tabernacle will cover both sides of the Tabernacle structure, extending fully over it.
Exodus 26:14 You shall also make an additional covering for the Tabernacle from rams' skins dyed red, and above that, another covering made from fine leather.
Exodus 26:15 You are to make the upright frames for the Tabernacle from acacia wood.
Exodus 26:16 Each frame board will be ten cubits high, which is about fifteen feet, and two cubits wide, which is about three feet.
Exodus 26:17 Each board will have two tenons at its bottom, like pegs, designed to fit into sockets, so that one board can be securely joined to another. You are to make all the boards for the Tabernacle this way.
Exodus 26:18 Of these boards, twenty will be placed on the south side, facing the south wind.
Exodus 26:19 You shall make forty silver bases to support these twenty boards. There will be two bases under each board, one for each of its tenons.
Exodus 26:20 On the second side of the Tabernacle, which faces the north, there will also be twenty boards.
Exodus 26:21 And for these, you will make forty silver bases, with two bases under each board.
Exodus 26:22 For the west side of the Tabernacle, you are to make six boards.
Exodus 26:23 And you will make two additional boards for the corners of the Tabernacle at the rear. These corner boards will be joined from the bottom all the way to the top and meet perfectly at the corner with a pivot-like joint. This is how it will be done for both corners.
Exodus 26:24 These boards will be joined securely from the bottom up to the very top, meeting together in a single unit at the top and by means of a precise hinge. This design will be applied to both parts and both corners, ensuring stability.
Exodus 26:25 So, for the west side and its corners, there will be a total of eight boards, and sixteen silver bases, with two bases under each board.
Exodus 26:26 You shall also make crossbars from acacia wood: five bars to hold together the boards on one side of the Tabernacle.
Exodus 26:27 And five bars for the boards on the other side of the Tabernacle, and five bars for the west side, which is the rear of the Tabernacle.
Exodus 26:28 The middle crossbar will run all the way through the centers of the boards, from one end to the other, providing continuous strength.
Exodus 26:29 You are to overlay the boards themselves with pure gold, and you will cast golden rings to serve as holders, through which the crossbars will be passed. And you shall also overlay the crossbars themselves with pure gold.
Exodus 26:30 You are to set up the Tabernacle exactly according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.
Exodus 26:31 You shall also make an inner veil from blue, purple, and double-dyed scarlet threads, along with fine twisted linen. It must be skillfully woven with intricate embroidery, showing various artistic designs.
Exodus 26:32 You will hang this veil by golden rings upon four pillars made of acacia wood. These pillars are themselves to be overlaid with gold and set into silver bases.
Exodus 26:33 Inside this veil, you are to place the Ark of the Testimony. The veil will then serve as the division between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, separating these two sacred areas.
Exodus 26:34 You shall also place the Mercy Seat upon the Ark of the Testimony within the Most Holy Place itself.
Exodus 26:35 You are to place the table outside the veil, and the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the Tabernacle, with the table itself on the north side.
Exodus 26:36 You shall also make a screen for the entrance of the Tabernacle, using blue, purple, and double-dyed scarlet threads, along with fine twisted linen, all expertly embroidered.
Exodus 26:37 And for this screen, you will make five pillars of acacia wood, which are to be overlaid with gold. Their capitals—the decorative tops—will also be golden, and you shall cast bronze bases for them.
Exodus 27:1 You shall also make an altar out of acacia wood. It must be five cubits long and five cubits wide, so it will be square, and it must be three cubits high.
Exodus 27:2 Make four horn-like projections extending from its four corners, all of it made from the same wood. Then cover the entire altar and its horns with bronze.
Exodus 27:3 You shall also make all the necessary tools for the altar: pans for removing the ashes, shovels, meat forks, and fire pans. All these tools must be made of bronze.
Exodus 27:4 You shall also make a bronze grate for it, designed like a net, and attach four bronze rings to its four corners.
Exodus 27:5 You must place this bronze grate below the lower rim of the altar, extending halfway up the altar itself.
Exodus 27:6 You shall also make carrying poles for the altar out of acacia wood, and cover these poles with bronze.
Exodus 27:7 These poles are to be inserted through the rings on the altar, so they extend from both sides, allowing the altar to be carried.
Exodus 27:8 You must make this altar hollow and empty on the inside, not solid, exactly as it was shown to you on the mountain.
Exodus 27:9 You shall also make a courtyard for the Tent of Meeting. On its south side, there will be hangings made of finely twisted linen, a hundred cubits long on that one side.
Exodus 27:10 For this, there will be twenty posts with twenty bronze bases, and the tops of these posts, along with their connecting rods, shall be made of silver.
Exodus 27:11 Similarly, for the north side, there will be hangings a hundred cubits long, along with twenty posts, the same number of bronze bases, and silver tops for the posts and their connecting rods.
Exodus 27:12 For the width of the courtyard, facing west, there will be hangings fifty cubits long, with ten posts and ten bases.
Exodus 27:13 For the width of the courtyard that faces east, it will also be fifty cubits.
Exodus 27:14 On one side of the entrance, there will be hangings ten cubits long, with three posts and three bases.
Exodus 27:15 And on the other side of the entrance, there will also be hangings ten cubits long, with three posts and three bases.
Exodus 27:16 At the entrance of the courtyard, you shall make a screen of twenty cubits in height, crafted from blue, purple, and scarlet material, and finely twisted linen, embroidered with designs. For this screen, there will be four posts and four bases.
Exodus 27:17 All the posts around the perimeter of the courtyard shall be joined with silver connecting rods and have silver caps, and all their bases will be bronze.
Exodus 27:18 The courtyard will be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide. Its hangings will be five cubits high, made of finely twisted linen, and all the bases of its posts shall be bronze.
Exodus 27:19 All the tools for the Tent of Meeting, used for every service and ceremony, and all its pegs, as well as the pegs for the courtyard, must be made of bronze.
Exodus 27:20 Command the sons of Israel to bring you the purest and clearest olive oil, so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.
Exodus 27:21 In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil that screens the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall tend these lamps so they burn from evening until morning before the Lord. This is a perpetual decree for the generations of the sons of Israel.
Exodus 28:1 You are to bring to yourself, Moses, your brother Aaron along with his sons from among the children of Israel. They are to perform the sacred office of priest for me: Aaron, Nadab, Abiu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
Exodus 28:2 You shall then make sacred garments for Aaron your brother, which are for his glory and for his beauty.
Exodus 28:3 And you shall speak to all those with wise hearts, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom. They are to make Aaron’s garments, in which he will be consecrated and minister to me.
Exodus 28:4 These are the garments which are to be made: the breastplate, the ephod, the priestly robe, the finely woven tunic, the turban, and the sash. They shall make these sacred garments for Aaron your brother and for his sons, so that they may perform the sacred office of priest for me.
Exodus 28:5 They shall bring gold, blue thread, purple thread, scarlet yarn that is dyed twice, and twisted fine linen.
Exodus 28:6 You shall make the ephod from gold, blue thread, purple thread, scarlet yarn dyed twice, and twisted fine linen, crafted with skillful weaving.
Exodus 28:7 You shall attach two shoulder pieces to its two sides, joining them together.
Exodus 28:8 The woven band of the ephod itself, which is a single piece, shall be made of the same skillful craftsmanship and materials: gold, blue thread, purple thread, scarlet yarn dyed twice, and twisted fine linen.
Exodus 28:9 You shall take two onyx stones and engrave upon them the names of the children of Israel:
Exodus 28:10 Six names on one stone, and the remaining six names on the other stone, according to the order of their birth.
Exodus 28:11 With the skill of an engraver, like those who carve precious stones, you shall engrave both stones with the names of the children of Israel, setting them in gold filigree and joining them securely.
Exodus 28:12 You shall place these stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, to serve as a memorial for the children of Israel. Aaron shall carry their names before the Lord upon both his shoulders, as a constant remembrance.
Exodus 28:13 You shall also make two settings of gold,
Exodus 28:14 and two chains of pure gold, woven like cords and intertwined with each other, which you shall fasten to the gold settings.
Exodus 28:15 You shall also make the breastplate of judgment, crafted with the same skillful weaving as the ephod, from gold, blue thread, purple thread, scarlet yarn dyed twice, and twisted fine linen.
Exodus 28:16 It shall be square and doubled over, measuring a span in length and a span in width.
Exodus 28:17 You shall place in it four rows of precious stones. In the first row, there shall be a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald.
Exodus 28:18 In the second row, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.
Exodus 28:19 In the third row, a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.
Exodus 28:20 In the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl. These stones shall be set in gold filigree and securely joined.
Exodus 28:21 There shall be twelve stones, each engraved with the name of one of the children of Israel, corresponding to each of the twelve tribes.
Exodus 28:22 For the breastplate, you shall make chains of pure gold, crafted like cords and intertwined with each other, just as you did for the ephod.
Exodus 28:23 You shall put these chains through two rings, which are to be on each side of the breastplate.
Exodus 28:24 You shall also put two other gold chains into two rings that are to be at the top of the ephod, on its front side.
Exodus 28:25 Then you shall join these chains to the gold settings that are on the front of the ephod's shoulder pieces.
Exodus 28:26 You shall also make two gold rings, which you shall place at the two lower ends of the breastplate, on the inner edge that faces the ephod.
Exodus 28:27 And two other gold rings you shall place on each side of the ephod, below, at its lower joint, on the front, and above the woven band of the ephod.
Exodus 28:28 You shall join the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that the breastplate remains securely attached and cannot become loose from the ephod.
Exodus 28:29 And Aaron shall carry all the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his chest whenever he enters the sanctuary. This will be a perpetual memorial before the Lord.
Exodus 28:30 You shall put the Urim and the Thummim into the breastplate of judgment. These sacred objects are to be on Aaron's chest when he enters before the Lord. Thus, Aaron shall always carry the means of discerning God's judgment for the children of Israel upon his chest before the Lord.
Exodus 28:31 You shall make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue thread.
Exodus 28:32 There shall be an opening for the head in its middle, with a woven border around this opening, like the collar of a woven garment, so that it will not easily tear.
Exodus 28:33 At the bottom hem of the robe, you shall make pomegranates of blue thread, purple thread, and scarlet yarn dyed twice, all around the hem. And in between these pomegranates, you shall place gold bells.
Exodus 28:34 The pattern shall be a gold bell, then a pomegranate, then a gold bell, then a pomegranate, and so on, all around the hem of the robe.
Exodus 28:35 Aaron shall wear this robe when he ministers as a priest, so that the sound of the bells is heard when he enters and exits the sanctuary before the Lord. This is to ensure his safety and prevent his death while ministering in God's presence.
Exodus 28:36 You shall also make a plate of pure gold, and engrave upon it, as one engraves a seal, the words: 'Holy to the Lord'.
Exodus 28:37 You shall fasten this plate with a blue cord, and it shall be worn upon the turban,
Exodus 28:38 on Aaron’s forehead. Aaron shall bear the iniquities connected with the holy offerings, those consecrated by the children of Israel, in all their sacred gifts and oblations. This gold plate shall always be on his forehead, so that the Lord may be gracious to the Israelites, accepting their offerings and forgiving any unintended sin in their sacred acts.
Exodus 28:39 You shall also make the turban of fine linen, and you shall weave the finely checkered tunic with embroidered needlework.
Exodus 28:40 Furthermore, for Aaron's sons, you shall make linen tunics, sashes, and caps, for their glory and for their beauty.
Exodus 29:1 Now, this is the ritual you shall perform to consecrate Aaron and his sons, so they may serve Me as priests. From the herd, take one young bull; also take two rams that are physically perfect and without blemish.
Exodus 29:2 From the finest wheat flour, you shall bake unleavened bread, as well as cakes made without yeast but mixed with oil. Also, make unleavened wafers that are brushed with oil.
Exodus 29:3 Place all these baked goods into one basket, and then present that basket to God. You shall also present the young bull and the two rams for the sacred offerings.
Exodus 29:4 Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony, the sacred dwelling where God’s presence is made known. There, you shall ritually cleanse them by washing them with water.
Exodus 29:5 Then, you shall dress Aaron in his consecrated priestly garments. These include the long tunic, the ephod (a special outer garment), and the breastpiece. You must secure the ephod and breastpiece with its woven sash.
Exodus 29:6 Next, place the priestly turban upon Aaron’s head, and fasten the sacred golden plate, inscribed with 'Holy to the Lord,' onto the front of the turban.
Exodus 29:7 Afterward, pour the special anointing oil generously upon Aaron’s head. Through this sacred anointing ritual, Aaron will be fully consecrated and set apart for God’s service.
Exodus 29:8 Bring Aaron’s sons forward also, and dress them in their tunics, the long white priestly garments.
Exodus 29:9 You shall tie sashes around both Aaron and his sons. Then, place turbans on the heads of Aaron’s sons. By this ceremony, they will become My priests according to an eternal, unchangeable law. After you have fully ordained them through this hand-consecrating ceremony,
Exodus 29:10 You shall bring the young bull, designated for the purification offering, to the front of the Tabernacle of Testimony. There, Aaron and his sons will lay their hands firmly upon the bull’s head, signifying the transfer of sin.
Exodus 29:11 You shall then slaughter the bull in the presence of the Lord, right at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony.
Exodus 29:12 Take some of the bull’s blood and, with your finger, smear it onto the four horns of the altar of burnt offering. Then, pour all the remaining blood from the bull at the base of the altar.
Exodus 29:13 Take all the fat that covers the bull’s internal organs, including the fatty lobe that is on the liver, and both kidneys with their surrounding fat. You are to burn these parts on the altar as a smoke offering.
Exodus 29:14 However, the bull’s flesh, its hide, and its dung you must carry outside the camp and burn completely with fire, because this animal serves as a purification offering to atone for sins.
Exodus 29:15 Next, you shall take one of the rams, designated for the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons will lay their hands upon its head, signifying dedication to God.
Exodus 29:16 Once you have slaughtered this ram, take its blood and pour it all around the altar of burnt offering.
Exodus 29:17 Cut the ram’s body into its separate pieces. Then, wash its internal organs and its legs thoroughly with water. Afterward, arrange these washed parts, along with the head and all the other cut pieces, on the altar to be burned.
Exodus 29:18 You shall offer the entire ram as a burnt offering, completely consumed by fire to the Lord. This is a burnt offering for the Lord, a pleasing aroma that signifies God’s acceptance, an offering given entirely to the Lord.
Exodus 29:19 Now, take the second ram, the ram designated for the ordination ceremony. Aaron and his sons will lay their hands upon its head.
Exodus 29:20 When you have slaughtered this ram, take some of its blood. With your finger, put a small amount of blood on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, and on the lobes of his sons’ right ears. Also, put blood on the thumb of their right hands and on the great toe of their right feet. The rest of the blood you shall pour all around the altar of burnt offering.
Exodus 29:21 Then, take some of the blood that is on the altar and mix it with some of the anointing oil. Sprinkle this mixture upon Aaron and his priestly garments, and upon his sons and their priestly garments. In this way, Aaron and his sons, along with their garments, shall all be fully consecrated and made holy.
Exodus 29:22 From the ram of ordination, you shall take the fat tail, the fat that covers the internal organs, the fatty lobe of the liver, both kidneys with their surrounding fat, and the right thigh. These are specific parts for the ram used in this priestly consecration ceremony.
Exodus 29:23 Also, from the basket of unleavened bread that is placed before the Lord, take one loaf of bread made with oil, one unleavened cake, and one unleavened wafer.
Exodus 29:24 Place all these items—the meat portions and the breads—upon the hands of Aaron and his sons. Then, you shall perform the wave offering, holding their hands as you present these consecrated things before the Lord.
Exodus 29:25 After the wave offering, take all the items from their hands and burn them completely on the altar of burnt offering. This will be a pleasing aroma before the Lord, for it is a special offering given to the Lord.
Exodus 29:26 You shall take the breast from the ram of ordination, which is designated for Aaron, and present it as a wave offering before the Lord. This breast will then become your designated portion, Moses.
Exodus 29:27 You shall consecrate the breast that was waved as a wave offering, and the thigh that was presented as a heave offering. These portions have been set apart from the ram for both Aaron and his sons.
Exodus 29:28 These portions shall be a perpetual entitlement for Aaron and his sons from the people of Israel. For they are a wave offering and a heave offering, taken from the peace offerings that the Israelites present to the Lord, designating them as holy sustenance for the priests.
Exodus 29:29 The holy garments that Aaron wears as high priest shall be passed down to his sons who succeed him. They are to be anointed in these very garments, and their hands consecrated, as part of their own ordination.
Exodus 29:30 The son who is appointed priest in Aaron’s place, and who enters the Tabernacle of Testimony to minister in the Holy Place, must wear these garments for seven consecutive days.
Exodus 29:31 You shall also take the ram that was used for the ordination ceremony and cook its meat in a sacred area within the Tabernacle courtyard.
Exodus 29:32 Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of that ram, along with the bread from the basket, at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony. This shared meal is an integral part of their consecration.
Exodus 29:33 They shall eat these things because they were offered to make atonement for their ordination and to consecrate them. No unauthorized person, no one outside the priestly family, may eat of these consecrated items, because they are holy and set apart for God.
Exodus 29:34 If any of the consecrated meat or any of the bread remains until the morning, you must burn the leftovers completely with fire. They are not to be eaten, because they have been made holy and cannot be kept overnight.
Exodus 29:35 You shall carry out all these commands precisely as I have instructed regarding Aaron and his sons. For seven full days, you shall perform the full ordination ceremony, consecrating their hands for service.
Exodus 29:36 Moreover, each day of these seven days, you shall offer a young bull as a sin offering to make atonement for the priests. When you offer this sacrificial atonement, you shall also purify the altar and anoint it with oil to consecrate it, making it holy for God.
Exodus 29:37 For seven days, you shall perform atonement for the altar and consecrate it. After this, the altar will be most holy, a true holy of holies. Everything and everyone who touches that consecrated altar shall become holy, absorbing its sacred status.
Exodus 29:38 Now, this is what you shall offer on the altar regularly and continually: two lambs, each one year old, every single day.
Exodus 29:39 One lamb is to be offered in the morning, and the other lamb in the evening, establishing a daily rhythm of worship.
Exodus 29:40 With the first lamb, you shall offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of pressed oil. And with each lamb, there shall be a drink offering of a quarter of a hin of wine, poured out before the Lord.
Exodus 30:1 You shall construct an altar for the burning of incense; you must make this altar from durable acacia wood.
Exodus 30:2 Its length will be one cubit, and its width one cubit, meaning it will be square. Its height will be two cubits. Its horns, a part of its construction, will extend upwards from it.
Exodus 30:3 You shall cover it with the purest gold, both its top and its sides, and its horns. And you shall make a golden rim around its top.
Exodus 30:4 And you shall place two golden rings below the rim on its opposite sides, so that poles may be inserted into them, and the altar can be carried by these poles.
Exodus 30:5 You shall also make these poles from acacia wood and cover them with gold.
Exodus 30:6 You shall place this altar in front of the veil that hangs before the Ark of the Testimony. It will be positioned before the atonement cover that shields the Testimony, which is the very place where I will speak with you.
Exodus 30:7 And Aaron shall burn upon this altar a most fragrant incense every morning. When he prepares the lamps, he shall light the incense upon it.
Exodus 30:8 And when he sets up the lamps in the evening, he shall burn incense again, a perpetual offering before the Lord throughout all your generations.
Exodus 30:9 You shall not offer upon it any other compounded incense, nor any burnt offering, nor any grain offering. Nor shall you pour out any drink offerings upon it.
Exodus 30:10 And Aaron shall make atonement upon its horns once each year with the blood from the sin offering. He shall purify it and consecrate it throughout your generations; it shall be most holy to the Lord.
Exodus 30:11 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying this:
Exodus 30:12 When you take a census of the sons of Israel according to their numbers, each one shall give a ransom for his soul to the Lord, so that no plague may come upon them when they are counted.
Exodus 30:13 This is what everyone who is counted shall give: half a shekel, according to the standard of the sanctuary shekel (which is twenty gerahs). This half-shekel portion shall be offered to the Lord.
Exodus 30:14 Everyone who is counted, from twenty years old and above, shall give this ransom.
Exodus 30:15 The rich shall not give more, nor shall the poor give less than the half-shekel, when they give the ransom for their souls to the Lord.
Exodus 30:16 You shall receive this money of atonement from the sons of Israel and dedicate it for the service of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. It shall be a memorial offering from the sons of Israel before the Lord, to make atonement for their souls.
Exodus 30:17 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying this:
Exodus 30:18 You shall also construct a bronze basin with its bronze stand for washing. You shall place it between the Tabernacle of the Testimony and the altar. And you shall put water in it.
Exodus 30:19 Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it.
Exodus 30:20 When they are about to enter the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and when they are about to approach the altar to offer incense to the Lord, they must wash so that they do not die.
Exodus 30:21 When they wash their hands and feet, they shall not enter the Tabernacle of the Testimony, nor shall they approach the altar to offer a fragrant offering to the Lord, lest they die. This ritual washing shall be a perpetual religious law for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations.
Exodus 30:22 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying this:
Exodus 30:23 Take the finest spices: five hundred shekels of liquid myrrh, two hundred and fifty shekels of fragrant cinnamon, and two hundred and fifty shekels of fragrant calamus.
Exodus 30:24 Also, take five hundred shekels of cassia, and one hin of olive oil.
Exodus 30:25 And from these ingredients, you shall make holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment skillfully compounded by a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.
Exodus 30:26 With this oil, you shall anoint the Tabernacle of the Testimony and the Ark of the Testimony.
Exodus 30:27 You shall also anoint the table with all its vessels, and the lampstand with all its accessories.
Exodus 30:28 You shall anoint both the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offerings, along with all the vessels that pertain to their service.
Exodus 30:29 You shall consecrate all these items, and they will become most holy. Everyone who touches them will be made holy by contact.
Exodus 30:30 You shall also anoint Aaron and his sons, and you shall consecrate them so that they may serve Me as priests.
Exodus 30:31 You shall also speak to the sons of Israel, saying: This holy anointing oil shall be set apart for Me throughout your generations.
Exodus 30:32 The body of a common person shall not be anointed with it, and you shall not make any other oil with a similar composition. Because it has been consecrated, it shall remain holy to you.
Exodus 30:33 Whoever makes anything like it, or puts any of it on a foreigner, shall be cut off from his people.
Exodus 30:34 The Lord also said to Moses: Take for yourself fragrant spices—liquid storax, onycha, sweet-smelling galbanum, and pure frankincense. All these spices must be of equal weight.
Exodus 30:35 And from these, you shall make compounded incense, the work of a perfumer, carefully blended, pure, and worthy of consecration.
Exodus 30:36 When you have ground it very finely, you shall place some of it before the Tabernacle of the Testimony, where I will speak with you. This incense shall be most holy to you.
Exodus 30:37 The incense that is made with this precise composition, you shall not make for yourselves, but you shall keep it consecrated exclusively for the Lord.
Exodus 30:38 Whoever makes anything like it simply to enjoy its fragrance shall be cut off from his people.
Exodus 30:39 N/A
Exodus 30:40 N/A
Exodus 31:1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Exodus 31:2 Look, I have specifically called Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah, by name.
Exodus 31:3 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, endowing him with wisdom, and understanding, and knowledge for every kind of work,
Exodus 31:4 to devise all sorts of intricate designs that can be crafted, and for the work of joining pieces together, and to work with gold, and silver, and bronze.
Exodus 31:5 and in the carving of marble, and various other stones, and in carpentry work, and for devising any type of artistic skill imaginable.
Exodus 31:6 I Myself have given him a companion, Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan.
Exodus 31:7 and in the heart of every skilled artisan, I have placed wisdom, so that they may accomplish everything I have commanded you:
Exodus 31:8 the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and the Ark of the Testimony, and the Mercy Seat which is upon it, and all the furnishings of the Tabernacle,
Exodus 31:9 and the table with its utensils, and the lampstand of pure gold with its utensils, and the altar of incense,
Exodus 31:10 and the altar of burnt offerings with its utensils, and all the other implements of the Tabernacle,
Exodus 31:11 and also the sacred priestly vestments for Bezaleel for his priestly duties, and the garments for the other ministers,
Exodus 31:12 and the anointing oil, and the sweet-smelling incense for the holy place.
Exodus 31:13 They shall make everything that I have commanded you.
Exodus 31:14 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: 'You must carefully observe My Sabbaths, because it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you.'"
Exodus 31:15 You must keep the Sabbath holy, because it is consecrated to you. Whoever profanes it shall surely be put to death. Anyone who performs any work on it, that person's soul shall be cut off from among their people.
Exodus 31:16 For six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath, a holy rest for the Lord. Anyone who does any work on this day shall die.
Exodus 31:17 So the children of Israel must keep the Sabbath, and celebrate it throughout their generations. It is an everlasting covenant between Me and the children of Israel, and a perpetual sign: because in six days the Lord created the universe and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested from His work and refreshed Himself.
Exodus 32:1 The people of Israel saw that Moses was taking a long time to come down from the mountain, so they gathered together against Aaron and said to him: "Stand up and make us gods to lead us, because as for this Moses, the man who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him."
Exodus 32:2 Then Aaron said to them: "Take off the gold earrings from the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me."
Exodus 32:3 So all the people did as he commanded and brought their earrings to Aaron.
Exodus 32:4 When he had received the gold from their hands, he formed it with a melting and shaping process and made a molten calf. Then they said: "These are your gods, O Israel, who led you out of the land of Egypt."
Exodus 32:5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf. He then proclaimed in a loud voice to all the people: "Tomorrow is a feast day for the Lord God!"
Exodus 32:6 The next morning, the people rose early and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then the people sat down to eat and drink, and afterward, they stood up to indulge in revelry.
Exodus 32:7 Then the Lord God spoke to Moses, saying: "Go down from the mountain! For your people, whom you led out of the land of Egypt, have sinned greatly."
Exodus 32:8 They have quickly turned aside from the way that I showed them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and they have worshipped it and offered sacrifices to it, saying: "These are your gods, O Israel, who led you out of the land of Egypt!"
Exodus 32:9 And again the Lord God said to Moses: "I see that this people is stubborn and stiff-necked."
Exodus 32:10 "Now, leave me alone, so that my burning wrath may rage against them, and I may destroy them. And I will make you into a great nation instead."
Exodus 32:11 But Moses pleaded with the Lord his God, saying: "Why, O Lord, should your burning wrath rage against your own people, whom you led out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?"
Exodus 32:12 "Please do not let the Egyptians say: 'He cunningly led them out only to kill them in the mountains and destroy them from the face of the earth.' Let your anger subside, and be merciful regarding the evil of your people."
Exodus 32:13 "Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your very self, saying: 'I will multiply your descendants like the stars of the sky, and all this land of which I have spoken, I will give to your descendants, and they will possess it forever.'"
Exodus 32:14 And the Lord God relented from doing the harm that He had threatened against His people.
Exodus 32:15 Moses then turned and came down from the mountain, holding the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand, inscribed on both sides, front and back.
Exodus 32:16 They were written by the very finger of God, and engraved with His work upon the tablets.
Exodus 32:17 When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting, he said to Moses: "The sound of battle cries is heard in the camp!"
Exodus 32:18 Moses replied: "That is not the sound of those encouraging a battle, nor the cry of those provoking flight. Rather, I hear the sound of singing."
Exodus 32:19 As he approached the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Enraged, he threw the tablets from his hands and smashed them at the foot of the mountain.
Exodus 32:20 He then took the calf they had made, burned it with fire, and ground it into powder. He scattered the powder into water and made the children of Israel drink it.
Exodus 32:21 And Moses said to Aaron: "What did this people do to you, that you brought such a great sin upon them?"
Exodus 32:22 Aaron replied to him: "Do not be angry, my lord. For you yourself know this people, that they are prone to evil."
Exodus 32:23 "They said to me: 'Make us gods to lead us, because as for this Moses, the man who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'"
Exodus 32:24 "So I said to them: 'Who among you has gold?' They took it off and gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out!"
Exodus 32:25 Moses then saw that the people were exposed and defenseless, for Aaron had stripped them bare and disgraced them before their enemies.
Exodus 32:26 So Moses stood at the entrance of the camp and said: "Whoever is for the Lord God, let him join me!" And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.
Exodus 32:27 He said to them: "Thus says the Lord God of Israel: 'Let each man put his sword on his thigh. Go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and let each man kill his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.'"
Exodus 32:28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and on that day, about twenty-three thousand men fell dead.
Exodus 32:29 And Moses said: "You have consecrated yourselves today for the Lord God, each man against his own son and his own brother, so that a blessing may be given to you."
Exodus 32:30 Now on the next day, Moses spoke to the people: "You have committed a very great sin. I will go up to the Lord God; perhaps I can make atonement for your wickedness."
Exodus 32:31 Then he returned to the Lord God and said: "Oh, Lord, I beg you, this people has committed a great sin, for they have made for themselves gods of gold!"
Exodus 32:32 "Now, either forgive them this guilt, or if you will not, then erase me from your book which you have written!"
Exodus 32:33 The Lord God replied to him: "Whoever has sinned against me, him will I erase from my book."
Exodus 32:34 "Now therefore, go and lead this people to the place of which I have spoken to you. My angel will go before you. For on the day of my vengeance, I will indeed punish them for this sin also."
Exodus 32:35 So the Lord God struck the people with a plague because of the wickedness they had committed in making the calf, which Aaron had made.
Exodus 33:1 The Lord also said to Moses: "Go up from this place—you and your people, whom you led out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: 'To your offspring I will give it.'"
Exodus 33:2 "And I will send an angel ahead of you to drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
Exodus 33:3 to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go up with you, because you are a stiff-necked people—lest I destroy you on the way."
Exodus 33:4 When the people heard this very harsh message, they mourned, and no one put on their ornaments of joy.
Exodus 33:5 And the Lord said to Moses: "Speak to the children of Israel: 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up among you for even one moment, I would destroy you. Now take off your ornaments, so that I may know what I will do to you.'"
Exodus 33:6 So the children of Israel removed their ornaments from themselves near Mount Horeb.
Exodus 33:7 Moses also took the tabernacle and pitched it outside the camp, far away, and called it "the Tent of Meeting" — or "Tabernacle of the Covenant". And everyone who sought the Lord would go out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.
Exodus 33:8 And when Moses went out to the tabernacle, all the people would rise and stand, each at the entrance of his own tent, and watch Moses' back until he entered the tabernacle.
Exodus 33:9 And when Moses had entered the Tent of Meeting, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tabernacle, and the Lord would speak with Moses.
Exodus 33:10 All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tabernacle. And all stood and worshipped, each at the entrance of their own tents.
Exodus 33:11 Now the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, just as a person speaks to a friend. When Moses returned to the camp, his assistant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tabernacle.
Exodus 33:12 And Moses said to the Lord: "See, You are commanding me to lead out this people, yet You have not let me know whom You will send with me. You have also said: 'I know you by name, and you have found favor with Me.'"
Exodus 33:13 "If, therefore, I have found favor in Your sight, show me Your presence, so that I may know You and continue to find favor in Your eyes. Consider this people—Your very own nation."
Exodus 33:14 And the Lord said: "My presence shall go before you, and I will give you rest."
Exodus 33:15 And Moses replied: "If You Your very self do not go before us, do not lead us up from this place."
Exodus 33:16 "For by what shall it be known that I and Your family—Your people—have found favor in Your sight, unless You walk with us? This is how we will be greatly honored by all the peoples who dwell upon the earth."
Exodus 33:17 And the Lord said to Moses: "Even this very request that you have spoken, I will do; for you have found favor before Me, and I know you by name."
Exodus 33:18 And Moses said: "Show me Your glory!"
Exodus 33:19 The Lord responded: "I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will show compassion on whom I please."
Exodus 33:20 And again He said: "You cannot see My divine presence, for no human being can see Me and live."
Exodus 33:21 And again He said: "Behold, there is a place near Me, and you shall stand upon the rock."
Exodus 33:22 "And when My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My hand until I have passed by."
Exodus 33:23 "Then I will take away My hand, and you will see My back—meaning My after-effect or the manifestation of My presence after I have passed—but My divine presence you cannot see."
Exodus 34:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses: 'Hew two stone tablets for yourself, exactly like the first ones were, and I will write upon them the exact same words that were on the first tablets, the ones you broke.'
Exodus 34:2 Be ready in the morning, so you can immediately ascend Mount Sinai and stand with Me at the very summit of the mountain.
Exodus 34:3 No one else is to ascend with you, and no one else is to be seen anywhere on the mountain. Furthermore, no cattle or sheep are to graze facing that mountain.
Exodus 34:4 So Moses hewed two stone tablets, just like the previous ones had been. Rising early in the night, he ascended Mount Sinai, exactly as the Lord had commanded him, carrying the tablets with him.
Exodus 34:5 And when the Lord descended in the cloud, Moses stood with Him, calling upon the very Name of the Lord.
Exodus 34:6 As He passed by Moses, He declared: 'The Lord, the Lord God—He is full of mercy and tenderness, ever-patient, abounding in steadfast love, and perfectly truthful.'
Exodus 34:7 —He who keeps mercy for thousands of generations, and takes away wickedness, and crimes, and all sins, though no one is inherently innocent before Him—He who repays the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and the children's children, even to the third and fourth generation.
Exodus 34:8 Moses immediately bowed down to the ground, prostrating himself, and worshipped God,
Exodus 34:9 saying, 'If I have found favor in Your sight, Lord, I beg you to walk among us—even though Your people are stubborn and rebellious—and take away our iniquities and our sins, and make us Your very own possession.'
Exodus 34:10 The Lord answered: 'I will now enter into a solemn covenant with you before all of your people. I will perform wonders that have never before been done on the earth, nor among any other nation, so that this people, in whose midst you live, may see the awe-inspiring works of the Lord that I am about to do.'
Exodus 34:11 Observe all that I am commanding you today: I myself will drive out from before you the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Exodus 34:12 Be careful never to make a covenant with the inhabitants of that land, lest they later become your ruin. Instead, you must destroy their altars, break their sacred pillars, and cut down their pagan groves.
Exodus 34:13 You are not to worship any foreign god; for the Lord, whose very Name is 'Jealous God,' is a God who demands absolute devotion.
Exodus 34:14 Do not by any means make a covenant with the people of those regions, because when they commit spiritual fornication with their gods, and worship their idols, someone might call you to eat from their sacrifices.
Exodus 34:15 Nor are you to take wives for your sons from among their daughters, lest when those women commit spiritual fornication, they also cause your sons to commit spiritual fornication with their gods.
Exodus 34:16 You are not to make for yourselves any molten gods.
Exodus 34:17 You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, just as I commanded you at the appointed time in the month of Abib—the month of new crops—for it was in the springtime that you came out of Egypt.
Exodus 34:18 Every firstborn male that opens the womb is Mine. Of all the livestock, both cattle and sheep, every firstborn male is to be consecrated to Me.
Exodus 34:19 The firstborn of a donkey you shall ransom with a lamb; but if you do not ransom it, then you must break its neck. Every firstborn of your sons you shall ransom, and you are not to appear before My presence empty-handed.
Exodus 34:20 You shall labor for six days, but on the seventh day you shall cease from plowing and from harvesting.
Exodus 34:21 You are to keep the Feast of Weeks, which is the feast of the first fruits of your wheat harvest, and also the Feast of Ingathering, which occurs at the turn of the year when all the crops are gathered in.
Exodus 34:22 Three times in a year, every male among you shall appear before the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel.
Exodus 34:23 For when I have driven out the nations from before you and enlarged your territories, no one will plot against your land when you ascend and appear before the presence of the Lord your God three times in a year.
Exodus 34:24 You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall any part of the Paschal lamb remain until morning.
Exodus 34:25 You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
Exodus 34:26 The Lord then spoke to Moses: 'Write these words for yourself, for it is by these very words that I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.'
Exodus 34:27 So Moses was there with the Lord for forty days and forty nights. He ate no bread and drank no water. And on the tablets, God Himself wrote the ten words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.
Exodus 34:28 Now when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, holding the two tablets of the Testimony—the covenant—he did not know that his face was emitting rays of light from his intimate communion with the Lord.
Exodus 34:29 Aaron and the children of Israel saw that Moses' face was emitting rays of light, and they were afraid to approach him closely.
Exodus 34:30 But Moses called them, so Aaron and the leaders of the assembly returned to him. And after he spoke to them,
Exodus 34:31 all the children of Israel came near to him, and he commanded them all the things he had heard from the Lord on Mount Sinai.
Exodus 34:32 And after he had finished speaking all the words, he put a veil over his face.
Exodus 34:33 Whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. And when he came out, he would speak to the children of Israel all that had been commanded to him.
Exodus 34:34 The children of Israel would see that Moses' face, as he came out, was emitting rays of light, and so he would put the veil over his face again until he went in to speak with the Lord.
Exodus 34:35 The children of Israel would see that Moses' face, as he came out, was emitting rays of light, and so he would put the veil over his face again until he went in to speak with the Lord.

Exodus 34:40 This verse does not exist in the Clementine Vulgate for Exodus chapter 34.
Exodus 35:1 Moses then called together all the people of Israel and he told them: “Here are the things that God has commanded you to do:”
Exodus 35:2 “You are to work for six days, but the seventh day will be holy for you. It is the Sabbath, a day of rest for the Lord. Anyone who does any work on that day will be put to death.”
Exodus 35:3 “You must not light any fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath day.”
Exodus 35:4 Moses then spoke to all the people of Israel again, saying: “These are the commands that God has given you:”
Exodus 35:5 “Set aside a sacred offering for the Lord. Everyone who is willing and eager to give with a generous heart should bring the Lord’s offering of gold, silver, bronze,”
Exodus 35:6 “blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric, fine linen, goat hair,”
Exodus 35:7 “ram skins dyed red, fine leather, acacia wood,”
Exodus 35:8 “oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet-smelling incense,”
Exodus 35:9 “and onyx stones and other jewels to be set into the High Priest’s ephod and breastplate.”
Exodus 35:10 “Every skilled craftsman among you should come and make everything that the Lord has commanded for the Tabernacle:”
Exodus 35:11 “the Tabernacle itself, its outer tent, its covering, the metal rings, the wooden frames, the crossbars, the pillars, and their bases,”
Exodus 35:12 “the Ark of the Covenant, its carrying poles, the Ark’s lid (the Mercy Seat), and the curtain that hangs in front of it,”
Exodus 35:13 “the table for the Bread of the Presence, its carrying poles, all its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence itself,”
Exodus 35:14 “the lampstand for light, its accessories, its lamps, and the oil for lighting,”
Exodus 35:15 “the altar of incense, its carrying poles, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the Tabernacle,”
Exodus 35:16 “the altar for burnt offerings, its bronze grating, its carrying poles, and all its utensils; the basin and its stand,”
Exodus 35:17 “the curtains for the courtyard, its pillars, their bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard,”
Exodus 35:18 “the pegs for the Tabernacle and the courtyard, along with their ropes.”
Exodus 35:19 “Also the beautifully woven priestly garments that will be used for ministering in the Holy Place: the sacred garments for Aaron, the High Priest, and the garments for his sons, so they can serve God as priests.”
Exodus 35:20 After Moses finished speaking, all the people of Israel departed from him.
Exodus 35:21 Then everyone whose heart was stirred and whose spirit was willing came and brought their offerings to the Lord for the work of the Tent of Meeting, which contained the Covenant, and for all the holy priestly garments.
Exodus 35:22 Both men and women came. They brought brooches, earrings, rings, bracelets—every kind of gold object. Anyone who was able to bring an offering of gold for the Lord brought it.
Exodus 35:23 And everyone who possessed blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric, fine linen, goat hair, red-dyed ram skins, or fine leather brought them.
Exodus 35:24 Everyone who was able to offer silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the Lord. And everyone who had acacia wood for any purpose brought it.
Exodus 35:25 All the women who were skilled in weaving crafted and spun the blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric, and fine linen.
Exodus 35:26 And all the women whose hearts were willing spun the goat hair.
Exodus 35:27 The leaders of the tribes brought onyx stones and other jewels for the ephod and the breastplate,
Exodus 35:28 along with spices and oil for the lamps, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
Exodus 35:29 All the men and women whose hearts willingly prompted them brought their gifts to the Lord, so that the work that God had commanded through Moses could be done.
Exodus 35:30 Then Moses said to the people of Israel: “Look, God has specifically called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.”
Exodus 35:31 “God has filled him with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, understanding, and knowledge in every kind of craft.”
Exodus 35:32 “He has given him the ability to design and create works of art using gold, silver, and bronze;”
Exodus 35:33 “to engrave stones and set them, to carve wood, and to work in every type of skilled craftsmanship.”
Exodus 35:34 “God has also put it in his heart, and in the heart of Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to teach others these skills.”
Exodus 35:35 “He has endowed both of them with exceptional wisdom and skill to perform every kind of artistic work—such as engraving, weaving, and embroidering with blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric, and fine linen, and to weave any kind of cloth, and to discover all sorts of new crafts.”
Exodus 36:1 So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled craftsman—to whom the Lord had given wisdom and understanding so they would know how to perform all the work for the holy sanctuary—they did everything the Lord had commanded.
Exodus 36:2 Then Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and every wise man whom God had gifted with wisdom, and all those who willingly came forward to perform the work.
Exodus 36:3 Moses gave back to them all the funds and everything that the children of Israel had offered as gifts to construct the sanctuary. Yet, every single morning, the people continued to bring their offerings,
Exodus 36:4 so the craftsmen who were engaged in the work of the sanctuary came forward.
Exodus 36:5 They said to Moses, "The people are offering more than what is needed."
Exodus 36:6 So Moses gave a command and sent out a proclamation, saying, "Let no man or woman offer anything more for the work of the sanctuary!" This is how the people were stopped from bringing gifts,
Exodus 36:7 because what had already been offered was sufficient and even superabundant.
Exodus 36:8 All the craftsmen who were wise of heart then began to complete the work of the tabernacle. They made ten curtains from fine twisted linen, blue fabric, purple fabric, and scarlet fabric dyed twice, crafted with varied and intricate artistic work.
Exodus 36:9 Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains had the same measurement.
Exodus 36:10 So they joined five of the curtains to one another, and the other five they also joined to one another.
Exodus 36:11 They also made loops of blue material at the edge of each of the five connected curtains, on both sides, for joining them together.
Exodus 36:12 There were fifty loops on one curtain set and fifty loops on the other, facing each other.
Exodus 36:13 They made fifty golden clasps by which the edges of the curtains were joined, so that the tabernacle would become one unified structure.
Exodus 36:14 They also made eleven curtains from goats' hair to cover the roof of the tabernacle.
Exodus 36:15 Each curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains had the same measurement.
Exodus 36:16 They joined five of these curtains by themselves, and the other six they joined by themselves.
Exodus 36:17 They made fifty loops at the extreme edge of one set of joined curtains, and fifty loops at the extreme edge of the other set, so that they could be joined together.
Exodus 36:18 They also made fifty bronze clasps, by which the loops of the covering could be joined, so that it would become one unified covering.
Exodus 36:19 They also made coverings for the tabernacle from rams' skins dyed red, and another covering above that, made from blue skins.
Exodus 36:20 They also made upright boards for the tabernacle from acacia wood.
Exodus 36:21 The length of each board was ten cubits, and its width was one and a half cubits.
Exodus 36:22 Each board had two tenons to connect one to the other; they made them this way for all the boards of the tabernacle.
Exodus 36:23 They made twenty boards for the south side, which faces the south.
Exodus 36:24 They made forty silver bases under each of the twenty boards—specifically, two bases under each tenon.
Exodus 36:25 For the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty boards.
Exodus 36:26 And they made forty silver bases, two bases under each board.
Exodus 36:27 For the western side of the tabernacle, they made six boards.
Exodus 36:28 And they made two boards for the back corners of the tabernacle,
Exodus 36:29 which were joined together from the bottom all the way to the top, and fitted into a single connection. They made them this way on both sides for the corners,
Exodus 36:30 so that there were eight boards in total, and sixteen silver bases, meaning two bases under each board.
Exodus 36:31 They also made bars of acacia wood: five bars for holding together the boards on one side of the tabernacle,
Exodus 36:32 five others for fitting to the boards of the other side, and also five for the western side of the tabernacle at the back.
Exodus 36:33 They also made a central bar running through the middle of the boards, extending from one end to the other.
Exodus 36:34 And they covered the boards themselves with sheets of gold, and made their bases of cast silver, and made golden rings through which the bars could be passed. The bars themselves were also covered with sheets of gold.
Exodus 36:35 They also made a veil from blue fabric, purple fabric, and scarlet fabric dyed twice, and fine twisted linen, woven with intricate artistic work and skillful craft.
Exodus 36:36 And they made four columns from acacia wood, which they covered with gold, and their bases were made of silver. Their hooks, however, were made of gold.
Exodus 36:37 They also made a curtain for the entrance of the tabernacle, from blue fabric, purple fabric, scarlet fabric dyed twice, and fine twisted linen, all woven with needlework.
Exodus 36:38 And they made five columns with their bases, which they covered with gold; their capitals and the decorative carvings were also gold. They also made five silver bases for these columns.
Exodus 37:1 Now, Bezalel constructed the Ark of the Covenant using acacia wood. Its length was two and a half cubits, its width was one and a half cubits, and its height was also one and a half cubits.
Exodus 37:2 He then overlaid the Ark, both inside and out, with pure gold. He also made a decorative molding of gold that went all around its top edge.
Exodus 37:3 He cast four gold rings and fastened them to each of the four corners—two rings on one side and two on the opposite side.
Exodus 37:4 He also made carrying poles from acacia wood, which he then overlaid with gold.
Exodus 37:5 He inserted these poles into the rings on the sides of the Ark, so it could be carried.
Exodus 37:6 He also made the Mercy Seat out of pure gold. It was two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.
Exodus 37:7 He crafted two cherubim from hammered pure gold, placing one at each end of the Mercy Seat.
Exodus 37:8 One cherub was on one end, and the other cherub on the opposite end. Their faces were turned towards each other, their wings were spread out over the Mercy Seat, and they were looking down at it, forming a unified piece with the Mercy Seat itself.
Exodus 37:9 He also constructed the Table of the Presence using acacia wood. It was two cubits long, one cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high.
Exodus 37:10 He covered the table with pure gold and fashioned a gold molding around its edge.
Exodus 37:11 He made a rim for the table, four fingers wide, and overlaid it with gold. Above this rim, he added another gold molding.
Exodus 37:12 He cast four gold rings and attached them to the four corners of the table, next to its legs.
Exodus 37:13 These rings were positioned near the lower molding so that poles could be inserted through them to carry the table.
Exodus 37:14 He made these carrying poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus 37:15 He also made the seven-branched Lampstand of pure, hammered gold. All parts of it were formed and crafted from solid gold.
Exodus 37:16 Its base, its central shaft, its branches, its cups, its decorative flower blossoms, and all its other elements were made of gold.
Exodus 37:17 Six branches extended from its sides: three branches on one side and three branches on the other.
Exodus 37:18 On each of the six branches, there were three cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with their ornamental knobs and flower petals. The three cups on the other branch were also in the shape of almond blossoms, with their knobs and petals.
Exodus 37:19 There were six branches extending from the central shaft of the Lampstand.
Exodus 37:20 And on the central shaft itself, there were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, along with their knobs and petals.
Exodus 37:21 There was a knob under each pair of the three sets of branches that extended from the Lampstand's main shaft.
Exodus 37:22 All the knobs and stems were made of pure, hammered gold.
Exodus 37:23 He also made the Lampstand's seven lamps, its snuffers, and its trays, all from pure gold.
Exodus 37:24 He used a talent of pure gold for the Lampstand and all its associated implements.
Exodus 37:25 He also made the Altar of Incense from acacia wood. It was square, one cubit long on each side, and two cubits high. Horns extended from its corners.
Exodus 37:26 He overlaid the altar—its top, its sides, and its horns—with pure gold. He also made a gold molding around its top edge.
Exodus 37:27 He cast two gold rings and placed them below the molding on two opposite sides, so that poles could be inserted through them to carry it.
Exodus 37:28 He made these carrying poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
Exodus 37:29 He also prepared the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense, following the precise work of a perfumer.
Exodus 37:30 He also constructed the Altar of Burnt Offering from acacia wood. It was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide, and three cubits high.
Exodus 37:31 Its horns were an integral part of it, extending from its corners, and he overlaid the entire altar with bronze.
Exodus 37:32 In the middle of the altar, he made a bronze grating, in the form of a network, extending from the top down to its halfway point.
Exodus 37:33 He cast four bronze rings and attached them to the four upper corners of the grating, so that poles could be inserted into them.
Exodus 37:34 He made these carrying poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
Exodus 37:35 He also made all the various utensils for the altar, for every ritual use: basins, meat hooks, shovels, tongs, and firepans—all made of bronze.
Exodus 37:36 He made a bronze base, which was placed near the altar. It had a bronze grating on top, like a network, reaching up to the middle of the altar.
Exodus 37:37 He cast four bronze rings and attached them to its four upper corners for inserting the carrying poles.
Exodus 37:38 He also made bronze carrying poles and overlaid them with bronze.
Exodus 37:39 He made all the vessels for the Dwelling (Tabernacle), along with all its other implements, including the curtains and their bases.
Exodus 37:40 And he made all the vessels of the Dwelling, for all its prescribed rituals.
Exodus 38:1 He also made the altar for burnt offerings out of acacia wood. It was five cubits long and five cubits wide, making it square, and it stood three cubits high.
Exodus 38:2 He made its horns to extend directly from each of its four corners. And he covered the entire altar with bronze plates.
Exodus 38:3 And he made all the various utensils for the altar's use: pans for gathering ashes, shovels, flesh hooks (three-pronged forks), hooks, and fire pans. All these objects were made entirely of bronze.
Exodus 38:4 He also made for it a bronze grating, like a mesh, positioned below the altar's rim and extending halfway down its interior. At the four corners of this grating, he put four bronze rings through which carrying poles could be inserted.
Exodus 38:5 He also made these carrying poles out of acacia wood and covered them with bronze plates.
Exodus 38:6 The altar itself, which had four parts, was carried by these poles.
Exodus 38:7 He also made the bronze laver with its bronze base from the mirrors of the women who ministered at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
Exodus 38:8 He also constructed the courtyard. On the south side, there were curtains made of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits long, supported by twenty bronze pillars with their bronze bases. The capitals of the pillars, and their connecting rods, were made of silver.
Exodus 38:9 On the north side, there were also curtains one hundred cubits long, with twenty bronze pillars and their bronze bases. The capitals of the pillars, and their connecting rods, were made of silver.
Exodus 38:10 But on the west side, the curtains were fifty cubits long, with ten pillars and ten bases. The capitals of the pillars, and their connecting rods, were made of silver.
Exodus 38:11 And on the east side, the curtains were fifty cubits long.
Exodus 38:12 Ten cubits on one side and ten cubits on the other covered the entrance of the courtyard, with two pillars and two bases on each side of the entrance.
Exodus 38:13 On the parts of the courtyard that stretched along each side of the main entrance, the curtains were fifteen cubits long, with three pillars and three bases.
Exodus 38:14 All the curtains of the courtyard were made of fine twisted linen.
Exodus 38:15 The bases of the pillars were bronze, and their capitals and connecting hooks were silver. The pillars themselves were covered with silver plating.
Exodus 38:16 And for the entrance of the courtyard, there was a curtain made of embroidered work, woven with blue, purple, scarlet yarns, and fine twisted linen. It was twenty cubits long and five cubits high, corresponding in all respects to the height of the courtyard curtains.
Exodus 38:17 For this entrance curtain, there were four bronze bases and four silver capitals, fitted with silver connecting hooks, and the pillars themselves were covered with silver plating.
Exodus 38:18 All the pegs for the Tabernacle and for the courtyard all around were made of bronze.
Exodus 38:19 The total amount of gold, silver, and bronze offered for the work of the sanctuary was recorded by these weights.
Exodus 38:20 The weights of the gold, silver, and bronze offered were tallied according to the count of those who had consulted Moses. Each individual's contribution was registered for the service of the Levites, under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.
Exodus 38:21 These are the items for the Tabernacle of the Testimony —where the covenant documents were kept— which were tallied by Moses, for the service of the Levites, under the direct supervision of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.
Exodus 38:22 Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, was the master craftsman and architect. He carved, sculpted, and brought forth all that could be conceived.
Exodus 38:23 And with him was Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an excellent craftsman and embroiderer in blue, purple, double-dyed scarlet yarn, and fine linen.
Exodus 38:24 All the gold that was used for the work of the sanctuary, including what was contributed by each individual, amounted to twenty-nine talents and seven hundred thirty shekels, measured by the sacred standard of the sanctuary.
Exodus 38:25 The silver offered by those who were registered among the people amounted to one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, measured by the sacred standard of the sanctuary.
Exodus 38:26 This was collected from each head of a household, twenty years old and above, from the six hundred three thousand five hundred men. Each man paid half a shekel, which is an obol according to the sacred weight of the sanctuary.
Exodus 38:27 Thus, there were one hundred talents of silver. From this silver, the bases for the sanctuary and the bases for the veil were cast: one hundred bases from one hundred talents, with one talent used for each base.
Exodus 38:28 And from the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels, he made the connecting hooks for the pillars, covered the pillar capitals with silver plating, and joined them with rings.
Exodus 38:29 The bronze offered amounted to seventy-two talents and four hundred shekels, measured by the sacred standard of the sanctuary.
Exodus 38:30 From this bronze, he made the bases for the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, the bronze altar, its bronze grating, and all its utensils.
Exodus 38:31 It was also used for the bases of the courtyard all around, and for its curtain at the entrance, and for all the pegs of the Tabernacle, and all the pegs for the courtyard all around.
Exodus 39:1 Therefore, from the violet, double-dyed purple, and scarlet threads, they made the garments that the priests were to wear when they ministered in the holy places and rituals, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39:2 So they made the ephod from gold, violet, double-dyed purple, scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen.
Exodus 39:3 They cut golden plates and hammered them into fine threads, so they could be twisted together with the other threads: the violet, double-dyed purple, scarlet, and very fine linen, all crafted with embroidered work.
Exodus 39:4 They made two shoulder pieces for it, which were connected on each side at the joining points.
Exodus 39:5 Its woven waistband was made of the very same materials, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39:6 They also prepared two onyx stones, set in gold filigree, and engraved them with the names of the sons of Israel, using the art of a gem cutter.
Exodus 39:7 They placed these stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as a memorial for the sons of Israel, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39:8 They also made the breastplate with embroidered work, similar to the work of the ephod, from gold, violet, double-dyed purple, scarlet thread, and twisted fine linen.
Exodus 39:9 It was square and doubled over, measuring one palm's length on each side.
Exodus 39:10 They set four rows of precious stones in it. The first row had a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald.
Exodus 39:11 The second row had a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.
Exodus 39:12 The third row had a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.
Exodus 39:13 The fourth row had a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl. All these stones were set in gold filigree and perfectly joined together.
Exodus 39:14 There were twelve stones, corresponding to the twelve names of Israel, each engraved with a single name by the art of a sculptor and gem cutter.
Exodus 39:15 They made chains for the breastplate, linked to each other, out of pure gold.
Exodus 39:16 They also made two gold clasps and two gold rings, which could be joined to the breastplate on both sides.
Exodus 39:17 Through these rings, they inserted the two gold chains and attached them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod.
Exodus 39:18 They also made two gold borders and two gold rings, and placed these rings on each side of the breastplate.
Exodus 39:19 And two other gold rings they fastened on the two lower edges of the ephod, on the inside, near where it was joined.
Exodus 39:20 This was so the breastplate could be fastened and secured by the rings and chains joining it.
Exodus 39:21 And the breastplate was bound by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord, so it could not become separated from the woven material it was joined to, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39:22 They also made the robe of the ephod entirely of violet thread.
Exodus 39:23 And there was an opening in the middle of it, like the opening of a coat of mail, so it could be put on, and its opening was reinforced with woven work all around.
Exodus 39:24 And at the bottom, all around the hem of this robe, they made decorations resembling pomegranates, using violet, double-dyed purple, scarlet thread, and twisted fine linen.
Exodus 39:25 They also made bells of pure gold and placed them between the pomegranates, all around the hem of the robe.
Exodus 39:26 So there was a bell and a pomegranate alternating all around the hem, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39:27 They also made tunics of fine linen, woven work, for Moses and his sons.
Exodus 39:28 And turbans of fine linen, and elegant linen caps, and linen breeches of fine linen.
Exodus 39:29 They also made a sash of twisted fine linen, and violet, double-dyed purple, and scarlet thread, all with embroidered work, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39:30 They also made the plate for the holy consecration, from pure gold, and engraved on it, with the work of a sculptor: 'Holy to the Lord.'
Exodus 39:31 They fastened it to the top of the turban with a violet cord, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39:32 So all the work of the Tabernacle and the Tent of the Covenant was completed. The sons of Israel did everything just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 39:33 And they brought the Tabernacle to Moses, along with the tent covering, and all its furnishings: the clasps, the planks, the bars, the pillars, and the bases.
Exodus 39:34 They brought the covering of ram skins dyed red, and the other outer covering made of violet-dyed animal skins.
Exodus 39:35 They brought the mercy seat, the table with all its utensils, the lampstand with its lamps, and all its accessories.
Exodus 39:36 They brought the golden altars, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the veil for the entrance of the Tabernacle.
Exodus 39:37 They brought the bronze altar, its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils, along with the laver and its base.
Exodus 39:38 They brought the hangings for the courtyard, and its pillars, its bases, and the veil for the gate of the courtyard, its cords, and its pegs, and all the utensils for the service of the Tabernacle and the Tent of the Covenant.
Exodus 39:39 They brought the garments that the priests wore when they ministered in the holy places and rituals.
Exodus 39:40 Just as the Lord had commanded Moses, so all the sons of Israel did everything.
Exodus 40:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses and said:
Exodus 40:2 On the first day of the first month, you shall set up the tent for the Ark of the Covenant, which bears witness to My covenant with Israel.
Exodus 40:3 Inside the tent, you shall place the Ark of the Covenant. Then you shall shield it with a veil.
Exodus 40:4 You shall bring in the table of the bread of the presence, and in proper order, you will arrange everything that belongs on it. You will then set up the lampstand with its lamps.
Exodus 40:5 You shall place the golden altar for incense offerings in front of the Ark of the Covenant. And you shall hang the curtain at the entrance of the tent.
Exodus 40:6 And in front of that altar, you shall place the altar for burnt offerings.
Exodus 40:7 You shall place the basin for washing between the altar and the tent, filling it with water.
Exodus 40:8 You shall then enclose the courtyard with its curtains and hang the curtain at the entrance of the entire courtyard.
Exodus 40:9 Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tent with all of its furnishings and vessels so that they may be set apart as holy to God.
Exodus 40:10 You shall also consecrate the altar for burnt offerings and all its vessels by anointing them.
Exodus 40:11 You shall anoint the washing basin with its stand, and you shall set them apart as holy.
Exodus 40:12 You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of the Ark of the Covenant. And when you have washed them with water,
Exodus 40:13 you shall dress Aaron in the holy garments. You shall anoint him and set him apart as holy to serve Me as a priest.
Exodus 40:14 You shall also bring his sons and dress them in tunics.
Exodus 40:15 You shall anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may serve Me as priests. And this anointing shall be for them a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.
Exodus 40:16 And Moses did everything exactly as the Lord had commanded him.
Exodus 40:17 So, in the first month of the second year, on the first day of that month, the tent for the Ark of the Covenant was set up.
Exodus 40:18 Moses set up the tent, placed its planks, its bases, its crossbars, and its pillars.
Exodus 40:19 He spread the covering over the tent and placed the outer covering on top of it, just as the Lord had commanded.
Exodus 40:20 He then took the tablets of the covenant and placed them inside the Ark. He placed the atonement cover on top of the Ark, and he brought the Ark into the tent.
Exodus 40:21 And he hung the veil in front of it, just as the Lord had commanded.
Exodus 40:22 He also placed the table in the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, on the north side, outside the veil.
Exodus 40:23 And he properly arranged the bread of the presence on it before the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:24 He also placed the lampstand in the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, opposite the table, on the south side.
Exodus 40:25 He arranged the lamps in their proper order according to the Lord's command.
Exodus 40:26 He also placed the golden altar for incense in the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, in front of the veil.
Exodus 40:27 He burned fragrant incense on it, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:28 And he hung the curtain at the entrance of the tent.
Exodus 40:29 He placed the altar for burnt offerings at the entrance of the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, and he offered burnt offerings and other sacrifices on it, just as the Lord had commanded.
Exodus 40:30 And he set the washing basin between the tent of the Ark of the Covenant and the altar, filling it with water.
Exodus 40:31 In it, Moses and Aaron, along with his sons, washed their hands and their feet.
Exodus 40:32 They would wash whenever they entered the tent of the covenant and whenever they approached the altar, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Exodus 40:33 He also erected the courtyard around the tent and the altar, setting up the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard. After everything was completed,
Exodus 40:34 a cloud covered the tent of the Ark of the Covenant, and the glory of the Lord filled it completely.
Exodus 40:35 And Moses was unable to enter the tent of the covenant because the cloud had covered it, and the majesty of the Lord shone brightly within it.
Exodus 40:36 Whenever the cloud lifted from the tent, the children of Israel would travel, moving forward in their groups.
Exodus 40:37 If the cloud remained above, they would stay in the same place.
Exodus 40:38 For the Lord's cloud rested upon the tent by day, and a fire was in it by night. All of Israel could see this, throughout all their journeys and encampments.
Leviticus 1:1 The Lord spoke to Moses inside the Tabernacle of Testimony, saying:
Leviticus 1:2 Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: When any person among you offers a sacrifice to the Lord, you must offer it from your livestock—either from your cattle or from your sheep.
Leviticus 1:3 If his offering is a burnt offering from his herd of cattle, he must present a perfect male animal at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony. This is so his offering will be acceptable to the Lord, making atonement for him.
Leviticus 1:4 He will lay his hand on the head of the animal offered for sacrifice, and this act will make it acceptable, thereby providing atonement for him.
Leviticus 1:5 Then he must slaughter the young bull before the Lord. Aaron's sons, the priests, will offer its blood by sprinkling it all around the altar, which stands at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
Leviticus 1:6 After skinning the animal offered for sacrifice, they will cut it into its individual pieces.
Leviticus 1:7 They will then place fire upon the altar, after arranging wood on it beforehand.
Leviticus 1:8 And on top of the wood and fire, they will arrange the cut pieces, including the head and all the internal fat that adheres to the liver.
Leviticus 1:9 However, the internal organs and the legs must be washed with water. Then the priest will burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 1:10 If the burnt offering is from the flock—either from the sheep or the goats—he must offer a perfect male animal without blemish.
Leviticus 1:11 He will slaughter it on the north side of the altar, before the Lord. Aaron’s sons will then sprinkle its blood all around the altar.
Leviticus 1:12 After cutting it into pieces, they will arrange the head and all the internal fat adhering to the liver on top of the wood, which has been placed on the fire.
Leviticus 1:13 However, the internal organs and the legs must be washed with water. Then the priest will offer all of it and burn it on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 1:14 If his burnt offering to the Lord is from birds—either turtledoves or young pigeons—
Leviticus 1:15 The priest will bring it to the altar. He will wring its neck to break it and then burn it on the altar, pressing its head against the side of the altar.
Leviticus 1:16 He will open the bird and remove its crop and its contents, not burning them, and throw them beside the altar on the east side, in the place where the ashes are usually placed.
Leviticus 1:17 He will tear its wings, but not separate them entirely from the body, and then burn the bird on the altar, upon the wood and the fire. This is a burnt offering, an offering of a most pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 1:18 When a person presents a grain offering as a sacrifice, his offering to the Lord must be fine flour.
Leviticus 1:19 He will pour olive oil on it and put frankincense on it, then bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests.
Leviticus 1:20 When the priest receives it, he will take a handful as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar; it is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 1:21 Whatever remains of the grain offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is a most holy portion from the Lord’s offerings.
Leviticus 1:22 When you offer a grain offering baked in an oven, it must consist of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.
Leviticus 1:23 If your grain offering is prepared on a griddle, it must be unleavened fine flour mixed with oil.
Leviticus 1:24 You will break it into pieces and pour oil over it.
Leviticus 1:25 If your grain offering is prepared in a pan, it must be fine flour mixed with oil.
Leviticus 1:26 The priests will take a portion of it as a memorial and burn it on the altar; it is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 1:27 Whatever remains will belong to Aaron and his sons, a most holy portion from the Lord’s offerings.
Leviticus 1:28 If a person sins unintentionally by doing something forbidden by the Lord's Law, and thus becomes guilty, even if they were unaware of the transgression at the time:
Leviticus 1:29 He must offer a perfect young bull from the herd to the Lord as a sin offering, and he will bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony, to the priest.
Leviticus 1:30 He will lay his hand on the head of the young bull and slaughter it before the Lord.
Leviticus 1:31 The priest will then sprinkle some of its blood all around the altar.
Leviticus 1:32 He will remove all the fat that covers the internal organs, and all the fat that is attached to the liver.
Leviticus 1:33 Just as the fat is removed from peace offerings, he will remove it and burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 1:34 The priest will pray for him, making intercession for his sin, and it will be forgiven him.
Leviticus 1:35 If his sin offering is a goat from the flock, he must offer a perfect female goat.
Leviticus 1:36 He will lay his hand on its head and slaughter it in the place where burnt offerings are usually killed, before the Lord.
Leviticus 1:37 The priest will sprinkle some of its blood all around the altar.
Leviticus 1:38 He will remove all its fat, just as the fat is removed from peace offerings, and burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. The priest will pray for him, and it will be forgiven him.
Leviticus 1:39 If he offers a lamb as his sin offering, he must offer a perfect male lamb.
Leviticus 1:40 He will lay his hand on its head and slaughter it in the place where burnt offerings are usually killed. The priest will sprinkle some of its blood all around the altar.
Leviticus 2:1 When a person offers a sacrificial offering to the Lord, that offering must be of fine flour — a grain offering.
Leviticus 2:2 And the person must pour oil over the fine flour, and then put frankincense on it, and bring it to the sons of Aaron, who are the priests.
Leviticus 2:3 One of the priests will take a handful of the fine flour and oil, along with all the frankincense, and burn it on the altar as a memorial portion. This offering is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 2:4 But whatever remains from the offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is considered most holy, taken from the Lord’s offerings.
Leviticus 2:5 When you offer a grain offering baked in an oven, it must be unleavened bread made of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers brushed with oil.
Leviticus 2:6 If your offering is prepared on a griddle, it must be of fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened.
Leviticus 2:7 After it is cut into pieces, you must pour oil over it.
Leviticus 2:8 If the offering is prepared on a baking pan, it must be of fine flour mixed with oil.
Leviticus 2:9 You will bring these offerings to the Lord through the hands of a priest. When the first priest presents it, he will hand it over to another priest.
Leviticus 2:10 This priest will then take a memorial portion from it and burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 2:11 Whatever remains from this offering will belong to Aaron and his sons. It is considered most holy, taken from the Lord’s offerings.
Leviticus 2:12 Every grain offering presented to the Lord must be made without leaven. You must not burn any honey in an offering made to the Lord.
Leviticus 2:13 Whatever you offer as firstfruits to the Lord, you must bring as a new offering. But it will not be burned on the altar as a pleasing aroma.
Leviticus 2:14 You must season every one of your offerings with salt. Do not omit the salt of the covenant of your God from your offering. You must offer salt with every single offering you make.
Leviticus 2:15 If you offer a grain offering of firstfruits of grain to the Lord, you must offer roasted heads of grain and crushed new grain as the beginning of your offering.
Leviticus 2:16 Over this, you must pour oil and put frankincense, because it is an offering to the Lord.
Leviticus 3:1 If someone brings a peace offering—an offering made to establish communion with God or give thanks—and chooses to offer an animal from his cattle, whether it is a male or a female, he must present it to the Lord without any physical defect.
Leviticus 3:2 And he shall place his hand upon the head of his sacrificial animal. This animal will then be slaughtered at the entrance of the tent of meeting. The sons of Aaron, who are priests, shall drain its blood and sprinkle it all around the altar.
Leviticus 3:3 From this peace offering, he shall then present as an offering by fire to the Lord the fat that covers the animal's internal organs, including all the fatty tissue surrounding these organs.
Leviticus 3:4 He shall also offer the two kidneys, with the fat that is on them near the loins, and the fatty lobe that covers the liver, removing it together with the kidneys.
Leviticus 3:5 The sons of Aaron shall then burn these parts on the altar, placing them on top of the burnt offering that is already laid upon the wood and the fire. This is an offering by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 3:6 If his offering is from the flock—that is, if he offers a peace offering from the sheep, whether it is a male or a female—he must present it without blemish.
Leviticus 3:7 If he offers a lamb, he must follow the same procedures described above for cattle.
Leviticus 3:8 He shall lay his hand upon the head of his sacrificial animal, which will then be slaughtered at the entrance of the tent of meeting. The sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood all around the altar.
Leviticus 3:9 From the peace offering, he shall then present as an offering by fire to the Lord its fat, including the entire fat tail, cut off close to the backbone. He shall also offer the fat that covers the internal organs.
Leviticus 3:10 And the two kidneys, with the fat that is on them near the loins, and the fatty lobe that covers the liver, removing it together with the kidneys.
Leviticus 3:11 The priest shall then burn these parts on the altar. This is the food of the offering by fire to the Lord.
Leviticus 3:12 If his offering is a goat, he must present it without blemish.
Leviticus 3:13 He shall lay his hand upon its head, and it will then be slaughtered at the entrance of the tent of meeting. The sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood all around the altar.
Leviticus 3:14 From it, he shall then present as an offering by fire to the Lord its fat, including the fat that covers the internal organs, and all the fatty tissue surrounding these organs.
Leviticus 3:15 And the two kidneys, with the fat that is on them near the loins, and the fatty lobe that covers the liver, removing it together with the kidneys.
Leviticus 3:16 The priest shall then burn these parts on the altar as food for the offering by fire, for a pleasing aroma. For all the fat belongs to the Lord.
Leviticus 3:17 This shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations and in all your dwelling places: you shall eat no fat and no blood.
Leviticus 4:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 4:2 “Speak to the children of Israel: If a person sins unintentionally, doing something that the Lord has forbidden in His commandments, and does not realize it at the time, then this is what they must do:
Leviticus 4:3 If the High Priest—the one who has been anointed—sins in a way that brings guilt upon the people, he must offer a young, unblemished bull to the Lord as a sacrifice for his own sin.
Leviticus 4:4 He must bring the young bull to the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, before the Lord. He shall place his hand upon its head and slaughter it there before the Lord.
Leviticus 4:5 Then he must take some of the bull's blood and carry it into the Tabernacle of the Testimony.
Leviticus 4:6 He shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times towards the veil of the sanctuary.
Leviticus 4:7 And he must put some of that same blood on the horns of the altar of pleasing incense before the Lord, which is inside the Tabernacle of the Testimony. The rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar for burnt offerings, which stands at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
Leviticus 4:8 Then he shall remove all the fat from the bull offered for sin: the fat that covers the intestines, and all the fat on the intestines,
Leviticus 4:9 and both kidneys with the fat that is on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.
Leviticus 4:10 He shall remove these, just as it is removed from a young bull offered as a sacrifice of peace, and burn them on the altar for burnt offerings.
Leviticus 4:11 But the bull's hide, all its meat along with its head and legs, its intestines, and its dung,
Leviticus 4:12 the entire bull, he must carry outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are usually poured out. He shall burn it with fire on a pile of wood in that clean place, outside the camp.
Leviticus 4:13 Now, if the entire congregation of Israel sins unintentionally, and through lack of attention does something against the Lord's commandment,
Leviticus 4:14 and later realizes its sin, the community must offer a young bull as a sacrifice for sin, and bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.
Leviticus 4:15 Then the elders of the community shall place their hands on its head before the Lord and slaughter it there.
Leviticus 4:16 The High Priest, who is anointed, must carry some of the bull's blood into the Tabernacle of the Testimony.
Leviticus 4:17 He shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times towards the veil.
Leviticus 4:18 And he shall put some of that same blood on the horns of the altar that is before the Lord inside the Tabernacle of the Testimony. The rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar for burnt offerings, which is at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
Leviticus 4:19 Then he must remove all its fat and burn it on the altar.
Leviticus 4:20 He shall do to this young bull just as he did to the previous one. And when the priest intercedes for them, the Lord will forgive them.
Leviticus 4:21 The young bull itself he shall carry outside the camp and burn, just as I commanded before.
Leviticus 4:22 If a ruler sins unintentionally, doing something against any of the commandments of the Lord his God, and afterwards realizes his guilt,
Leviticus 4:23 he must offer a male goat, unblemished, as a sacrifice.
Leviticus 4:24 He shall place his hand on its head and slaughter it in the place where burnt offerings are usually killed before the Lord, because it is a sacrifice for sin.
Leviticus 4:25 Then the priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the sacrifice and put some of it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings, pouring the rest at its base.
Leviticus 4:26 But he shall burn all its fat on the altar, just as with a burnt offering. And when the priest intercedes for him, the Lord will forgive him for his sin.
Leviticus 4:27 If an ordinary person from the common people sins unintentionally, doing something forbidden by the Lord’s law, and thus incurs guilt,
Leviticus 4:28 and afterwards realizes their sin, they must offer an unblemished female goat as a sacrifice.
Leviticus 4:29 They shall place their hand on the head of the sacrifice for sin and slaughter it in the place of the burnt offering.
Leviticus 4:30 Then the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings, and pour the rest at its base.
Leviticus 4:31 And he shall remove all its fat, just as fat is removed from peace offerings, and burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. And when the priest intercedes for the person, the Lord will forgive them.
Leviticus 4:32 If someone offers a male lamb without blemish as a sacrifice for sin,
Leviticus 4:33 they shall place their hand on its head and slaughter it in the place where burnt offerings are usually slaughtered.
Leviticus 4:34 Then the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar for burnt offerings, and pour the rest at its base.
Leviticus 4:35 And he shall remove all its fat, just as it is removed from the ram sacrificed for peace offerings, and burn it on the altar as an incense to the Lord. And when the priest intercedes for the person, the Lord will forgive them for the sin they committed.
Leviticus 5:1 If a person commits a sin by not speaking up,
after they have heard a public oath or adjuration
calling for witnesses to testify,
and they themselves were a witness
to something they saw or knew,
but they failed to report what they knew,
then that person will be held accountable for their sin.
Leviticus 5:2 Or if a person touches anything ritually unclean—
whether the carcass of an unclean wild animal,
or the carcass of an unclean domestic animal,
or the carcass of an unclean crawling creature—
and they were initially unaware of the ritual impurity,
but then later remember and realize it,
that person becomes ritually unclean and is guilty of sin.
Leviticus 5:3 Or if a person touches human uncleanness,
any kind of ritual impurity by which a person normally becomes defiled,
and they were initially unaware of it,
but then later remember and realize it,
that person will be guilty.
Leviticus 5:4 Or if a person acts sinfully by making a rash vow—
swearing with their lips to do something, whether good or bad,
or making any other kind of sworn promise—
and then they forget about it,
but afterwards realize their failure to keep it,
that person has committed a transgression.
Leviticus 5:5 Therefore, whoever commits a sin in any of these ways
must confess their sin.
Leviticus 5:6 And they shall offer for their sin to the Lord
a female animal from the flock, either a lamb or a goat.
And the priest will then make atonement for that person, for their sin.
Leviticus 5:7 But if the person cannot afford to offer an animal from the flock,
then they shall offer to the Lord two turtledoves or two young pigeons:
one as a sin offering, and the other as a burnt offering to God.
Leviticus 5:8 The priest shall offer the first bird as the sin offering,
wringing its head at the neck, but without fully detaching it.
Leviticus 5:9 And he shall sprinkle some of its blood on the side of the altar,
but the remaining blood shall be drained at the base of the altar,
because this is a sin offering.
Leviticus 5:10 But the other bird he shall prepare as a burnt offering,
according to the usual ritual.
Then the priest will make atonement for that person, for their sin,
and they will be forgiven.
Leviticus 5:11 But if the person cannot afford to offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
then for their sin, they shall offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour.
It must be offered without olive oil and without frankincense,
because it is a sin offering.
Leviticus 5:12 And the person shall bring it to the priest,
who, taking a handful of it, will set it aside as a memorial portion,
and then burn it on the altar as a portion for the Lord.
Leviticus 5:13 Thus the priest will make atonement for that person,
for the sin they committed, and they will be forgiven.
The remainder of the offering, however, will belong to the priest as his portion.
Leviticus 5:14 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 5:15 If a person commits a transgression and, by mistake,
unknowingly acts against what is consecrated to the Lord—
for this trespass, they shall offer an unblemished ram from the flock
as a guilt offering,
valued at two just shekels according to the sanctuary standard.
Leviticus 5:16 And if the person has caused any loss concerning consecrated things,
they must make full restitution for that loss,
and add a fifth part (twenty percent) to it,
giving it to the priest.
Then the priest will make atonement for them by offering the ram.
Leviticus 5:17 If a person commits a sin by mistake,
unknowingly doing something that is forbidden by the Lord's Law,
and later becomes aware of their transgression,
that person will still bear the guilt of their sin.
Leviticus 5:18 And they shall bring an unblemished ram from the flock to the priest,
valued appropriately for the trespass.
Then the priest will make atonement for that person for their unintentional sin,
because they acted unknowingly, and they will be forgiven.
Leviticus 5:19 This is for an unintentional transgression against the Lord.
Leviticus 5:20 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 5:21 If a person commits a sin, and thereby shows contempt for the Lord,
by denying to their neighbor a deposit that had been entrusted to their care,
or by violently taking what belongs to another,
or by committing fraud,
Leviticus 5:22 or by denying that they found something lost,
and then swearing a false oath about it—
whatever the specific thing for which they have sinned,
Leviticus 5:23 when they are guilty of such a trespass,
they must restore everything they took away by any kind of fraud,
and add a fifth part (twenty percent) to it,
giving it back to the owner whom they defrauded.
Leviticus 5:24 And for their sin, they shall offer an unblemished ram from the flock to the Lord,
giving it to the priest,
valued appropriately for the measure and estimation of the sin.
Leviticus 5:25 Then the priest will make atonement for them before the Lord,
and they will be forgiven for whatever sin they have committed in any of these cases.
Leviticus 5:26 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 6:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 6:2 If a person sins by acting contemptuously toward the Lord, for example, by denying a deposit left with them by their neighbor, or by extorting something by force, or by committing fraud,
Leviticus 6:3 or if they have denied finding something, and then sworn a false oath concerning it; or if they have done anything else from all the ways that a person typically commits sin:
Leviticus 6:4 once they are found guilty of this wickedness, they must return everything they gained through deceit. They must also add an additional fifth part to it, giving this total amount to the priest, as compensation for what they unjustly took.
Leviticus 6:5 And for their specific sin, they shall offer a perfect ram, without blemish, from the flock. They will give this ram to the priest for atonement, according to its assessed value and the prescribed manner of expiation.
Leviticus 6:6 The priest will then pray for them before the Lord. After this, whatever sin they have committed will be forgiven them.
Leviticus 6:7 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 6:8 Command Aaron and his sons this: This is the law for the burnt offering, also known as the holocaust. The burnt offering is the sacrifice that is completely consumed by fire on the altar, burning from evening throughout the night until morning. The fire for this offering must always be kept burning on the altar.
Leviticus 6:9 The officiating priest shall put on his sacred linen tunic and linen breeches. Then he shall gather the ashes from the burnt offering—the ashes that the sacrificial fire has consumed—and pour them next to the altar.
Leviticus 6:10 After this, he must change into different garments, and then carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place.
Leviticus 6:11 The fire on the altar must always be kept burning; it shall never be allowed to go out. Every morning, the priest shall add wood to it and arrange the burnt offering on top. Then he will burn the fat of the peace offerings upon it.
Leviticus 6:12 This fire is to be perpetual; it shall never be allowed to fail or go out on the altar.
Leviticus 6:13 This is the law for the sin offering. The animal for this offering must be slaughtered in the very place where the burnt offering is sacrificed, before the Lord. This sacrifice is considered most holy.
Leviticus 6:14 The priest who eats of this offering must observe the ritual laws. If any of its flesh should accidentally touch his garment, that garment must be washed in a holy place to purify it.
Leviticus 6:15 Any clay vessel in which the offering has been cooked must be broken afterward. But if it is a bronze vessel, it shall be thoroughly scoured and washed with water.
Leviticus 6:16 Every male descendant of the priestly family may eat of this offering, because it is considered most holy.
Leviticus 6:17 However, any sin offering whose blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting—the tabernacle of testimony—to make atonement within the sanctuary, shall not be eaten. Instead, it must be completely consumed by fire.
Leviticus 6:18 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 6:19 This is the special grain offering that Aaron and his sons must offer to the Lord on the day of their anointing: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with oil, as a perpetual grain offering to be made regularly.
Leviticus 6:20 Half of this offering shall be presented in the morning, and the other half in the evening.
Leviticus 6:21 It shall be prepared in a pan, mixed with oil, and fried. After you have divided it into suitable portions and pieces, you shall offer it as a burnt offering, a truly pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 6:22 The priest who succeeds his father and is anointed with the same sacred ritual shall perform this offering in the same way. This is an eternal, prescribed law for the Lord alone. The entirety of this offering must be consumed by fire.
Leviticus 6:23 Every grain offering made by a priest shall be completely consumed by fire; it shall never be eaten.
Leviticus 6:24 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 6:25 Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law for the sin offering. The animal for this offering shall be slaughtered in the very same place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, before the Lord. This sacrifice is considered most holy.
Leviticus 6:26 The priest who presents this offering for sin shall eat it in a holy place—specifically, in the court of the Tent of Meeting, which is the tabernacle of testimony.
Leviticus 6:27 Whatever touches the flesh of the offering shall become holy. If any of its blood is sprinkled on a garment, that part of the garment must be washed in a holy place.
Leviticus 6:28 Any clay vessel in which the offering has been cooked must be broken. But if it is a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured and then rinsed thoroughly with water.
Leviticus 6:29 Every male from the priestly family may eat of it, because it is considered most holy.
Leviticus 6:30 However, any sin offering—any victim whose blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting, which is the tabernacle of testimony, to make atonement in the sanctuary—shall not be eaten. Instead, it must be completely consumed by fire.
Leviticus 7:1 These are the laws for the sin offering, which is most holy.
Leviticus 7:2 Just as with the burnt offering, the sin offering is to be sacrificed in the place where the burnt offering is killed. Its blood is to be poured out all around the altar.
Leviticus 7:3 They must offer all its fat: the fat tail (especially prominent in certain sheep breeds), the fat covering the entrails, both kidneys with the fat that covers them, and the fatty lobe of the liver, which is typically removed along with the kidneys.
Leviticus 7:4 The priest shall then burn these parts on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord, an offering for sin.
Leviticus 7:5 Every male in the priestly family is permitted to eat its flesh in a holy place, because this offering is most holy.
Leviticus 7:6 The same rules apply to the trespass (or guilt) offering: it is most holy, and it belongs to the priests.
Leviticus 7:7 The priest who presents it as an offering is the one who shall eat it.
Leviticus 7:8 Whenever a burnt offering is made, the hide of the animal, which is not burned, shall belong to the priest whose hand poured out its blood.
Leviticus 7:9 Every grain offering that is baked in the oven, or prepared on the griddle, or in a pan, shall belong to the priest who offers it.
Leviticus 7:10 Any grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, shall be given to all the sons of Aaron in equal shares.
Leviticus 7:11 This is the law for the peace offering that is presented to the Lord.
Leviticus 7:12 If someone offers it as a thank offering, they must present unleavened loaves mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and fine flour fried with oil, along with thin cakes mixed with oil.
Leviticus 7:13 They must also offer leavened loaves along with the thank offering, which is sacrificed as part of the peace offerings.
Leviticus 7:14 From each kind of bread, they shall present one loaf to the Lord as a heave offering for the firstfruits. These loaves will then belong to the priest who pours out the animal’s blood.
Leviticus 7:15 The flesh of the peace offering, which is sacrificed as a thank offering, must be eaten on the very same day it is offered. Nothing from it may be left until the next morning.
Leviticus 7:16 If the offering is made because of a vow, or as a freewill offering, and not as a thank offering, then it may be eaten on the day it is offered, but any remaining portion may be eaten on the second day.
Leviticus 7:17 But any part of the offering that is left over by the third day must be completely burned with fire.
Leviticus 7:18 If anyone eats the flesh of the peace offering on the third day, the offering will not be accepted, and it will bring no benefit to the one who presented it. Furthermore, any person who partakes of such defiled meat shall be held guilty of a serious transgression against God’s law.
Leviticus 7:19 Any meat that touches something unclean must not be eaten; instead, it must be completely burned with fire. Whoever eats of such defiled meat will become unclean themselves.
Leviticus 7:20 However, if the meat itself is clean, but a person who is ritually unclean eats from it, that person will be cut off from their people and their spiritual lineage.
Leviticus 7:21 And if a person touches human uncleanness, or the uncleanness of any animal, or anything else that can defile, and then eats from the flesh of these peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from their people.
Leviticus 7:22 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 7:23 Say to the children of Israel: 'You must not eat the fat from any ox, sheep, or goat.'
Leviticus 7:24 The fat from an animal that dies naturally or is torn by wild beasts may be used for other practical purposes (such as making soap or fuel for lamps), but it is absolutely forbidden for food.
Leviticus 7:25 If anyone eats the fat of an animal from which a fire offering is made to the Lord, that person shall be cut off from their people.
Leviticus 7:26 Moreover, in all your settlements, you must not eat any blood from any creature that has flesh.
Leviticus 7:27 Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from their people.
Leviticus 7:28 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 7:29 Say to the children of Israel: 'Whoever brings a peace offering to the Lord must present his offering to the Lord from what he has brought, as a gift from his own hands (this refers to the ritual of the wave offering).
Leviticus 7:30 With his own hands, he must bring the fat (which is burned as a pleasing aroma) and the breast, which have been separated from the rest of the meat, to be presented to the Lord as a fire offering.
Leviticus 7:31 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast portion of the animal is to belong to Aaron and his sons.
Leviticus 7:32 Furthermore, the right thigh (often referred to as the shoulder or upper arm in other contexts) from the peace offerings shall be given to the priest as his priestly portion.
Leviticus 7:33 The priest who offers the blood and the fat of the peace offering shall receive the right thigh as his own share.
Leviticus 7:34 For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering from the children of Israel, from their peace offerings. I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their perpetual due, by an everlasting statute.
Leviticus 7:35 This is the priestly due and portion for Aaron and his sons from the offerings made to the Lord, given to them on the day they were brought forward to serve as priests.
Leviticus 7:36 The Lord commanded these portions to be given to them by the children of Israel as a religious observance, to be upheld forever.
Leviticus 7:37 These are the laws concerning the burnt offering, the sin offering, the trespass (or guilt) offering, the consecration offering for priests, and the peace offerings.
Leviticus 7:38 These are the laws that the Lord established for Moses on Mount Sinai, when He commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings to the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai.
Leviticus 8:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 8:2 “Gather Aaron and his sons, along with the sacred garments, the anointing oil, a calf for the sin offering, a ram for the burnt offering, and a basket filled with unleavened bread.
Leviticus 8:3 Then you shall assemble the entire congregation at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Meeting.”
Leviticus 8:4 So Moses did everything the Lord had commanded. And all the congregation gathered at the entrance.
Leviticus 8:5 Moses said to the assembly: “This is what the Lord has commanded to be done.”
Leviticus 8:6 Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward. He washed them with water,
Leviticus 8:7 and he clothed Aaron, the High Priest, with the tunic. He wrapped the sash around him, put the robe on him, and then placed the ephod on him.
Leviticus 8:8 He fastened the woven band of the ephod to Aaron’s shoulder and secured the breastplate with its own artistic sash.
Leviticus 8:9 He put the breastplate on Aaron, which contained the Urim and Thummim (the “Lights and Perfections” for divine revelation). He placed the turban on Aaron’s head, and on the front of the turban, he affixed the golden plate—the holy diadem, just as the Lord had commanded him.
Leviticus 8:10 Then Moses took the anointing oil and consecrated the Tabernacle and all its furnishings by anointing them.
Leviticus 8:11 After consecrating them, he sprinkled the altar seven times, anointing it and all its utensils to consecrate them fully.
Leviticus 8:12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, setting him apart for his sacred office.
Leviticus 8:13 Moses then brought Aaron’s sons forward and clothed them with tunics, sashed them with sashes, and placed headbands on them, just as the Lord had commanded.
Leviticus 8:14 Next, he brought the calf for the sin offering. Aaron and his sons placed their hands on the head of the calf,
Leviticus 8:15 and Moses slaughtered it. Taking some of the blood, he put his finger into it and touched the horns of the altar all around, purifying it. He then poured the remaining blood at the base of the altar, thereby consecrating it to make atonement for it.
Leviticus 8:16 He took all the fat covering the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with their fat, and burned them up in smoke on the altar.
Leviticus 8:17 But the hide, the meat, and the dung of the calf he burned outside the camp, just as the Lord had commanded.
Leviticus 8:18 Then Moses presented the ram for the burnt offering. Aaron and his sons placed their hands on its head.
Leviticus 8:19 When Moses had slaughtered it, he sprinkled the blood around all sides of the altar.
Leviticus 8:20 He cut the ram into pieces, and then burned the head, the pieces, and the fat in smoke upon the altar.
Leviticus 8:21 After washing the entrails and the legs, Moses burned the entire ram on the altar. This was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded him.
Leviticus 8:22 Then he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination for the priests. Aaron and his sons placed their hands on its head.
Leviticus 8:23 When Moses had slaughtered it, he took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
Leviticus 8:24 He then brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the remaining blood on the lobe of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. The rest of the blood he sprinkled around the altar.
Leviticus 8:25 He then took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that covered the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, both kidneys with their fat, and the right thigh.
Leviticus 8:26 From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord, he took one unleavened loaf, one cake of bread mixed with oil, and one wafer. He placed all these on top of the fat portions and the right thigh.
Leviticus 8:27 He put all these items together into the hands of Aaron and his sons. They presented them as a wave offering before the Lord.
Leviticus 8:28 Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them up in smoke on the altar, on top of the burnt offering. This was an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 8:29 Moses also took the breast from the ram of ordination as his own portion, just as the Lord had commanded him.
Leviticus 8:30 Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and their garments all around. In this way, he consecrated them and their garments.
Leviticus 8:31 Moses then said to Aaron and his sons: “Boil the meat at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Meeting, and eat it there, along with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat them.’
Leviticus 8:32 Whatever remains of the meat and the bread you shall burn with fire.”
Leviticus 8:33 You shall not go outside the entrance of the Tabernacle for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed. For seven days you will be ordained by God himself.
Leviticus 8:34 What has been done today is to complete the ritual; it will be done again tomorrow.
Leviticus 8:35 You shall remain at the entrance of the Tabernacle day and night for seven days, keeping the Lord’s charge, so that you do not die. For this is what I have been commanded.”
Leviticus 8:36 So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord had commanded through Moses.
Leviticus 9:1 It happened on the eighth day—the day after their seven-day consecration period—Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel, and spoke to them.
Leviticus 9:2 And Moses said to Aaron: 'Take a young bull from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. Both must be without any blemish, and you must offer them before the Lord.'
Leviticus 9:3 Then you, Aaron, must speak to the sons of Israel, saying: 'Take a male goat from the flock for a sin offering, and a yearling calf and a yearling lamb, both without blemish, for a burnt offering.'
Leviticus 9:4 Also, take an ox and a ram for peace offerings, both without blemish, so that they may be sacrificed before the Lord. And include fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering. For all these things will be offered before the Lord today.
Leviticus 9:5 So they brought all the things that Moses had commanded to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony, and the whole assembly stood there.
Leviticus 9:6 And Moses said: 'This is the very thing the Lord has commanded you to do. Perform these rituals, and the glorious presence of the Lord will become visible to you.'
Leviticus 9:7 Then Moses said to Aaron: 'Approach the altar, and offer your own sin offering and your burnt offering. Make intercession for yourself and for the people. After that, offer the people's offering, just as the Lord has commanded.'
Leviticus 9:8 Immediately, Aaron approached the altar and sacrificed the young bull for his own sin offering.
Leviticus 9:9 And his sons brought the blood to him. He dipped his finger into the blood, touched the horns of the altar, and then poured the remaining blood at the base of the altar.
Leviticus 9:10 Then, from the sin offering, he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver upon the altar.
Leviticus 9:11 However, the animal's flesh, its hide, its head, its legs, and its entrails—he burned these outside the camp, utterly consuming them.
Leviticus 9:12 He also sacrificed the burnt offering according to the prescribed ritual. His sons brought him the blood, which he then poured all around the perimeter of the altar.
Leviticus 9:13 But the offering itself—that is, the pieces of the animal, its head, and each individual limb—he completely consumed with fire upon the altar.
Leviticus 9:14 He also washed the entrails and the legs with water, and then burned them together upon the altar.
Leviticus 9:15 Then Aaron presented the people's offering. He took the male goat that was designated for their sins and sacrificed it, thereby purifying the altar through this ritual.
Leviticus 9:16 He also brought the burnt offering and placed it upon the altar, performing the ritual precisely as it is prescribed in the ceremonies.
Leviticus 9:17 He also presented the grain offering, which consisted of fine flour mixed with olive oil. He took a handful of it and burned it upon the altar, separate from the burnt offering.
Leviticus 9:18 Then he sacrificed the ox and the ram as peace offerings for the people. His sons brought him the blood, which he poured all around the altar.
Leviticus 9:19 But the fat portions of the oxen and the rams, along with their fatty tails, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver—all these parts came from the peace offerings.
Leviticus 9:20 They placed these fatty parts on top of the priests' portion of the breasts. Then, when they burned all the fat portions on the altar,
Leviticus 9:21 Aaron set aside the breasts along with the right thigh as a priestly portion—a wave offering presented before the Lord, just as Moses had been commanded.
Leviticus 9:22 Then Aaron raised his hands towards the people and blessed them. After descending from the altar, he completed the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
Leviticus 9:23 After this, Moses and Aaron entered the Tabernacle of Testimony. When they came out, they blessed the people, and immediately, the glorious presence of the Lord became visible to the entire assembly.
Leviticus 9:24 And behold, fire miraculously came forth from the Lord's presence and instantly consumed both the burnt offering and the fat portions that were on the altar. When everyone witnessed this, they all shouted together in praise to the Lord, falling prostrate on their faces in reverence.
Leviticus 10:1 Then Nadab and Abihu, Aaron’s sons, took their censers. They put fire into the censers and placed incense upon that fire. This act was an unauthorized offering before the Lord, a type of fire that God had not commanded them to use in worship.
Leviticus 10:2 Immediately, a fire came directly from the Lord and consumed them. They died in the presence of the Lord.
Leviticus 10:3 Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is the meaning of what the Lord declared: 'I will be recognized as holy by those who draw near to me in worship, and before all the people, I will be glorified.'" When Aaron heard this, he remained silent, understanding God's judgment.
Leviticus 10:4 Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, who were the sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel. He told them, "Go and carry your kinsmen away from the front of the holy place, and take them outside the camp for burial."
Leviticus 10:5 They immediately took them, still in their priestly tunics, and carried them outside the camp, just as Moses had commanded.
Leviticus 10:6 Then Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his remaining sons: "Do not uncover your heads, and do not tear your garments in mourning. Do not do this, lest you yourselves die and the Lord’s anger come upon all the congregation. Instead, let your relatives and all the house of Israel mourn the burning which the Lord has sent."
Leviticus 10:7 "And you yourselves must not leave the entrance of the tabernacle. Do not leave, lest you die, because the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you." So they did everything according to Moses’ command.
Leviticus 10:8 The Lord also spoke to Aaron, saying:
Leviticus 10:9 "You, and your sons with you, must not drink wine or any intoxicating drink when you enter the tent of meeting. If you do, you will die. This is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations."
Leviticus 10:10 "This command is given so that you may distinguish between what is holy and what is not holy, and between what is defiled and what is clean."
Leviticus 10:11 "And it is so that you may teach the children of Israel all My statutes which the Lord has spoken to them through Moses."
Leviticus 10:12 Then Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his remaining sons: "Take the grain offering that remains from the Lord's offerings and eat it without leaven beside the altar. Do this because it is most holy."
Leviticus 10:13 "You shall eat it in a holy place, for it has been given to you and your sons as your portion from the sacrifices of the Lord."
Leviticus 10:14 "Also, the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented as a heave offering, you, your sons, and your daughters with you, shall eat in any clean place. For these are assigned to you and to your sons and daughters as your due portion from the peace offerings of the children of Israel."
Leviticus 10:15 "The thigh and the breast are your due because they are the offerings of elevation and separation, which are presented before the Lord. These belong to you and your sons by a perpetual statute, just as the Lord has commanded."
Leviticus 10:16 Moses carefully inquired about the goat that had been offered for the sin offering, and he found that it had been burned completely. Being angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, he said:
Leviticus 10:17 "Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place? It is most holy, and it was given to you to remove the iniquity of the congregation and to make atonement for them before the Lord."
Leviticus 10:18 "Its blood was not brought inside the holy place and into the sanctuary, so you should have eaten it in the holy place, as it was commanded."
Leviticus 10:19 Aaron answered Moses: "Indeed, today a sin offering and a burnt offering have been presented before the Lord. But you know what misfortunes have happened to me this day – the death of my sons. If I had eaten its flesh today, would it have pleased the Lord?"
Leviticus 10:20 When Moses heard this, he immediately approved.
Leviticus 11:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them:
Leviticus 11:2 Speak to the children of Israel. These are the living creatures you are permitted to eat from all the animals on the earth.
Leviticus 11:3 Any animal that has a hoof which is divided—that is, split into two separate parts—and that also chews the cud, you are permitted to eat.
Leviticus 11:4 But any creature that chews the cud yet does not have a divided hoof, such as the camel and similar animals, will be considered ritually unclean for you.
Leviticus 11:5 The rock badger—a creature that chews the cud but does not have a divided hoof—is ritually unclean.
Leviticus 11:6 Likewise, the rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof, and so it is ritually unclean.
Leviticus 11:7 The pig, too, has a divided hoof but does not chew the cud, and so it is ritually unclean.
Leviticus 11:8 You are not permitted to eat the meat of these animals, nor are you permitted to touch their dead bodies, for they are ritually unclean for you.
Leviticus 11:9 These are the kinds of creatures you are permitted to eat from all the living things that dwell in the waters: Anything that has fins and scales, whether in the sea, in rivers, or in ponds, you are permitted to eat.
Leviticus 11:10 But anything that does not have fins and scales, among the creatures that move in the waters, and among those that live in rivers and ponds, will be ritually unclean for you.
Leviticus 11:11 You must consider their flesh detestable, and you must avoid their dead bodies.
Leviticus 11:12 All creatures in the waters that do not have fins and scales will be ritually unclean.
Leviticus 11:13 These are the birds you are not permitted to eat, and they must be avoided by you: the eagle, the lammergeier (a type of vulture), and the sea eagle,
Leviticus 11:14 the kite, and every kind of falcon or hawk,
Leviticus 11:15 and every kind of raven.
Leviticus 11:16 the ostrich, the little owl, the seagull, and every kind of hawk,
Leviticus 11:17 the screech owl, the cormorant, and the ibis,
Leviticus 11:18 the swan, the pelican, and the purple heron,
Leviticus 11:19 the stork, and every kind of plover, also the hoopoe, and the bat.
Leviticus 11:20 Every winged creature that walks on four legs is to be considered detestable by you.
Leviticus 11:21 However, you are permitted to eat those among the winged creatures that walk on four legs, but which also have longer legs at the back, enabling them to leap upon the ground.
Leviticus 11:22 You are permitted to eat these: every kind of locust, the bald locust, the cricket, and the grasshopper, each according to its own kind.
Leviticus 11:23 But every winged creature that has only four legs (and no other means of propulsion) is to be considered detestable by you.
Leviticus 11:24 Anyone who touches the dead bodies of these creatures will be ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 11:25 And anyone who carries away any part of their dead bodies must wash his clothes, and he will be ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 11:26 Every animal that has a hoof but neither divides it nor chews the cud will be ritually unclean. Anyone who touches such an animal will be ritually unclean.
Leviticus 11:27 Among all the animals that walk on four legs, those that touch the ground with their paws as if they were hands are ritually unclean for you. Anyone who touches their dead bodies will be ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 11:28 And anyone who carries their dead bodies must wash his clothes, and he will be ritually unclean until evening. All these creatures are ritually unclean for you.
Leviticus 11:29 These also are among the swarming creatures that move on the earth and are ritually unclean for you: the weasel, the mouse, and every kind of large lizard (like the monitor lizard),
Leviticus 11:30 the shrew, the chameleon, the gecko, the wall lizard, and the mole.
Leviticus 11:31 All these are ritually unclean. Anyone who touches their dead bodies will be ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 11:32 And if any dead body of these creatures falls upon an object, that object will become defiled. This applies to a wooden vessel, clothing, hides, or sacks. Any such object, if suitable for any use, must be immersed in water, and it will remain ritually unclean until evening. After that, it will be purified.
Leviticus 11:33 But if any dead body of these creatures is found inside an earthenware vessel, that vessel must be broken, because it becomes so defiled that it cannot be cleansed.
Leviticus 11:34 Any food that is touched by water from such a defiled vessel will become ritually unclean. And any liquid that is in such a vessel will also become defiled.
Leviticus 11:35 And if any of these dead bodies falls on an oven or a stove, these items will become ritually unclean. They must be broken down and destroyed because they are defiled.
Leviticus 11:36 However, springs, cisterns, and any collection of water will remain ritually clean. But anyone who touches the dead bodies of these creatures, even in such water, will become defiled.
Leviticus 11:37 If any dead body falls on seeds that are meant for planting, the seeds will remain ritually clean.
Leviticus 11:38 But if water has been poured over the seeds, and then a dead body falls into it, the seeds will become ritually unclean for you.
Leviticus 11:39 If an animal that you are permitted to eat dies naturally, anyone who touches its dead body will be ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 11:40 And anyone who eats any part of its dead body, or carries it, must wash his clothes, and he will be ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 12:1 The Lord God spoke to Moses, giving him these instructions:
Leviticus 12:2 “Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: When a woman becomes pregnant after receiving seed, and then gives birth to a male child, she will be ritually unclean for seven days. This time of uncleanness is exactly like the days of her monthly separation.”
Leviticus 12:3 “On the eighth day, the boy child must be circumcised.”
Leviticus 12:4 “She will then remain in a state of purification from her bleeding for thirty-three more days. During this period, she must not touch anything that is holy, nor may she enter the sanctuary of God, until the full days of her purification are complete.”
Leviticus 12:5 “But if she gives birth to a female child, she will be ritually unclean for two weeks, following the same ritual for monthly separation. Then, she will remain in a state of purification from her bleeding for sixty-six more days.”
Leviticus 12:6 “When the full time of her purification is complete, whether it was for a son or a daughter, she must bring a yearling lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Testimony, bringing them to the priest.”
Leviticus 12:7 “The priest will then present these offerings before the Lord God and pray for her. In doing this, she will be declared ritually clean from the flow of her blood. This is the ritual law for a woman who gives birth, whether to a male or a female child.”
Leviticus 12:8 “If her financial means are not sufficient, and she cannot afford to offer a lamb, then she may take two turtledoves or two young pigeons. One will be for a burnt offering, and the other will be for a sin offering. The priest will then pray for her, and she will be declared ritually clean.”

Leviticus 13:1 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Leviticus 13:2 If a man develops a discolored eruption on the skin of his flesh—whether it's a scab, or a spot—and it looks like the plague of leprosy, which is a term for a severe, ritualistically 'unclean' skin condition, then he must be brought to Aaron the priest, or to any of his sons who are priests.
Leviticus 13:3 And when the priest examines him, if the hairs in the affected area are white, and the area itself appears deeper than the rest of the skin, then it is indeed the uncleanness of leprosy, meaning it is a severe, ritually contaminating condition. The priest will then, by his judgment, declare him unclean and set him apart from the community.
Leviticus 13:4 But if the spot is whitish, and it is not deeper than the rest of the skin, nor does it have white hairs, then by the priest's command, the man with the eruption must be confined for seven days.
Leviticus 13:5 And if, on the seventh day when he is examined, his eruption has remained the same and has not spread on the skin, the priest must confine him again for another seven days.
Leviticus 13:6 And if again, on the seventh day, the eruption appears faded and has not spread on the skin, the priest will declare him clean. The man must then wash his clothes, and he will be clean.
Leviticus 13:7 But if after being declared clean and having shown himself to the priest, the leprosy has spread on the skin, he must return to the priest.
Leviticus 13:8 And the priest, seeing that it has spread, will declare him unclean.
Leviticus 13:9 If there is a plague of leprosy on a man, he must be brought to the priest.
Leviticus 13:10 And when the priest has examined him, and sees white hairs on the skin, and living flesh that has grown in the affected area,
Leviticus 13:11 it is a very old leprosy, and it has become chronic on the skin of his entire body. The priest will not declare him clean, because he is certainly unclean.
Leviticus 13:12 But if the leprosy has broken out over the skin and covered all the flesh from head to foot, wherever the priest's eye can see,
Leviticus 13:13 the priest will examine him and declare him completely clean. This is because it has entirely turned to a white color, and therefore he is clean.
Leviticus 13:14 However, whenever living flesh appears in that area, he will be unclean:
Leviticus 13:15 and then the priest, when he sees the living flesh, will judge him to be unclean.
Leviticus 13:16 But if it turns back to whiteness again, and covers all the flesh,
Leviticus 13:17 the priest will judge him to be clean.
Leviticus 13:18 If on a person's flesh and skin, a boil has formed and healed,
Leviticus 13:19 and after healing, a whitish or reddish scar appears, and the priest comes to examine this condition,
Leviticus 13:20 and sees that it is deeper than the surrounding flesh and has white hairs, he will declare him unclean, for it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus 13:21 But if the hair in the area is of its original color, and the skin is level and not deeper, he must confine the person for seven days.
Leviticus 13:22 And if it spreads, you will judge him to be unclean with leprosy.
Leviticus 13:23 But if it remains in its place, the priest will declare him clean.
Leviticus 13:24 If human skin has been burned by fire, and in the wound itself, a reddish or whitish color appears,
Leviticus 13:25 and when the priest examines it, he sees white hair in the affected area, and the area itself is deeper than the surrounding skin, he will judge him to be unclean, because the plague of leprosy has arisen in the burn.
Leviticus 13:26 But if the hair is of its original color, and the skin is level and not deeper, he must confine the person for seven days.
Leviticus 13:27 And on the seventh day, when he examines it, if it has spread, he will declare him unclean: for it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus 13:28 But if the wound has remained in its place and is of its original color, and is not deeper than the surrounding flesh, the priest will declare him clean: because it is a burn wound, and it is healing.
Leviticus 13:29 If a man or a woman has a plague-like affliction on the head or beard,
Leviticus 13:30 and the priest sees that it is deeper than the surrounding flesh, and the hairs in it are yellowish and very fine, he will judge them to be unclean: because it is leprosy of the head and beard.
Leviticus 13:31 But if the place of the affliction is level with the skin, and the hair is of its original color, he must confine the person for seven days.
Leviticus 13:32 And on the seventh day, if the place of the affliction has not spread, and the hair is of its original color, and the skin is level,
Leviticus 13:33 then with all the hair shaved off—he himself must shave it—and after washing his clothes, he will be clean.
Leviticus 13:34 If after being declared clean, the affliction on the head or beard spreads again,
Leviticus 13:35 and it is not deeper than the surrounding flesh, but the color of the affliction itself remains as it was before,
Leviticus 13:36 the priest will be certain and will declare him unclean without any doubt: because the affliction has spread.
Leviticus 13:37 But if it has remained in place, and the hair is of its original color, he will declare him clean, and he must wash his clothes, and he will be clean.
Leviticus 13:38 If a man or a woman develops white spots on their skin,
Leviticus 13:39 the priest will examine them: and if the color is somewhat dark, or not perfectly white, it is a mild skin condition called vitiligo, and the person is clean.
Leviticus 13:40 A man whose hair has fallen out from his head is bald, and he is clean.
Leviticus 14:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 14:2 “This is the law for one with leprosy: when he is declared clean, he shall be brought to the priest.
Leviticus 14:3 The priest will go outside of the camp, and when he sees that the person is truly clean,
Leviticus 14:4 he will order the one who is to be cleansed to bring two live, ritually clean sparrows, and cedar wood, and scarlet thread, and hyssop.
Leviticus 14:5 Then, the priest will command that one of the sparrows be sacrificed in an earthenware vessel over living—that is, running—water.
Leviticus 14:6 But the other live sparrow, along with the cedar wood, the scarlet thread, and the hyssop, he will dip into the blood of the sacrificed sparrow, and into the living water.
Leviticus 14:7 And he will sprinkle it seven times upon the one who is to be cleansed from the leprosy. After this ritual is completed, he will say: 'You are clean.'
Leviticus 14:8 Then the cleansed person must wash his clothes, shave off all the hair from his head, eyebrows, and beard. He must remove all the hair from his body. He will then wash himself with water, and he will be clean.
Leviticus 14:9 On the eighth day, he must take two male lambs without blemish, and one yearling ewe lamb without blemish. He also needs three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil by itself.
Leviticus 14:10 The priest who performs the purification will bring the person and all these offerings before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus 14:11 The priest will stand and present him before the Lord.
Leviticus 14:12 He will take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil. He will present both of them—the lamb and the oil—as a wave offering before the Lord.
Leviticus 14:13 He will sacrifice the lamb in the holy place where the sin offering and burnt offering are usually sacrificed. For just as the sin offering and the burnt offering belong to the priest, so does the guilt offering; it is most holy.
Leviticus 14:14 The priest will take some of the blood from the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one being cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
Leviticus 14:15 Then, from the log of oil, the priest will pour some into his own left palm.
Leviticus 14:16 He will dip his right forefinger into the oil and sprinkle some of it seven times before the Lord.
Leviticus 14:17 The rest of the oil that remains in his hand he will pour on the head of the one being cleansed. In this way, the priest will make atonement for him before the Lord.
Leviticus 14:18 The priest will then offer the sin offering. And using its blood, as mentioned before, he will cleanse the one who has been purified.
Leviticus 14:19 After that, he will sacrifice the burnt offering.
Leviticus 14:20 He will place both the burnt offering and its grain offerings on the altar. In this way, the person will be clean.
Leviticus 14:21 “Now, if the person is poor and cannot afford all these things, he must take one male lamb for a guilt offering to be waved, making atonement for him. He also needs three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil.
Leviticus 14:22 He must also bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one to be offered as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.
Leviticus 14:23 On the eighth day of his purification, he will bring them to the priest, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the Lord.
Leviticus 14:24 The priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering and the log of oil, and wave them together as a wave offering before the Lord.
Leviticus 14:25 He will then sacrifice the lamb for the guilt offering. And he will put some of its blood on the lobe of the right ear of the one being cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
Leviticus 14:26 The priest will also pour some of the oil into his left palm,
Leviticus 14:27 and dipping his right forefinger into it, he will sprinkle some seven times before the Lord.
Leviticus 14:28 Then he will touch the lobe of the right ear of the one being cleansed, and the thumb of his right hand, and the big toe of his right foot—specifically, on the places where he had previously put the blood of the guilt offering.
Leviticus 14:29 The rest of the oil that remains in the priest's hand he will pour on the head of the purified person, in order to make atonement for him before the Lord.
Leviticus 14:30 He will also offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons—
Leviticus 14:31 whichever he can afford to provide. One will be for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, according to their prescribed ritual.
Leviticus 14:32 This is the sacrifice for the person with leprosy, who, because of his lack of resources, cannot afford to provide the full offering for his purification according to the Lord's law.”
Leviticus 14:33 The Lord spoke again to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Leviticus 14:34 “When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving to you as a possession, and if a disease of leprosy—that is, a severe mold or mildew—appears in a house or dwelling:
Leviticus 14:35 the owner of that house must go and tell the priest, saying: 'It seems to me that something like leprosy has appeared in my house.'
Leviticus 14:36 The priest will order that everything be taken out of the house before he enters to inspect whether it is truly the disease, so that everything inside the house will not become unclean. After this, he will finally go in to examine the house.
Leviticus 14:37 When he inspects it, if there are spots on its walls that appear greenish or reddish, and they are sunken below the surrounding surface:
Leviticus 14:38 he will go out the door of the house, and immediately close it up for seven days.
Leviticus 14:39 He will return on the seventh day. If he finds that the affliction has spread,
Leviticus 14:40 he will command that the stones in which the affliction is present be removed and thrown outside the city into an unclean place.
Leviticus 15:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Leviticus 15:2 Any person, male or female, who suffers from an abnormal discharge of bodily fluid—such as an unusual flow of semen, or other bodily fluids—will be ritually unclean.
Leviticus 15:3 This condition of ritual uncleanness will be established and declared as such when a discharge flows from his body, or even if the discharge is somehow stopped.
Leviticus 15:4 Any bed on which such a person sleeps will become ritually unclean, and whatever they sit upon will also become ritually unclean.
Leviticus 15:5 If anyone touches the bed of such a person, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:6 If anyone sits where the unclean person has sat, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:7 Whoever touches the flesh of the unclean person must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:8 If the unclean person spits upon someone who is ritually clean, that person must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:9 Every saddle or seat upon which the unclean person has ridden will become ritually unclean.
Leviticus 15:10 And whoever touches any of these things will be ritually unclean until evening. If someone carries such a thing, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:11 Anyone whom the unclean person touches while sitting, if the unclean person has not first washed their hands, must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:12 Any clay vessel that the unclean person touches must be broken. But if it is a wooden vessel, it will be washed with water.
Leviticus 15:13 Therefore, after the person with the discharge has been healed, they must count seven days for their purification. After washing their clothes and their entire body in living—that is, running—water, they will then be ritually clean.
Leviticus 15:14 On the eighth day, such a person must take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them before the Lord, at the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony, and give them to the priest.
Leviticus 15:15 The priest will offer one bird as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. The priest will then pray for that person before the Lord, so that they may be cleansed from their discharge.
Leviticus 15:16 When a man has a normal emission of semen, he must wash his entire body with water, and he will be ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:17 Any garment or leather that he is wearing when this occurs will also become ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:18 If a man and woman have intercourse, both of them must wash themselves with water, and they will both be ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:19 A woman who is menstruating will be set apart for seven days.
Leviticus 15:20 Anyone who touches her during this time will be ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:21 Any bed on which she sleeps during her days of separation will become ritually unclean, and whatever she sits upon will also become ritually unclean.
Leviticus 15:22 If anyone touches her bed, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:23 If anyone touches any vessel upon which she has sat, they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:24 If a man sleeps with her during the time of her menstrual blood, he will become ritually unclean for seven days, and every bed on which he sleeps will become ritually unclean.
Leviticus 15:25 A woman who suffers a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her normal menstruation, or one whose blood continues to flow immediately after her menstruation, will remain ritually unclean for as long as she suffers the discharge, just as she would during menstruation.
Leviticus 15:26 Every bed on which she sleeps throughout the entire time of her discharge will be as ritually unclean as the bed of a menstruating woman, and whatever she sits upon will also be ritually unclean.
Leviticus 15:27 Whoever touches any of these things will be ritually unclean; they must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and remain ritually unclean until evening.
Leviticus 15:28 If, however, the blood discharge ceases, she must count seven days for her purification.
Leviticus 15:29 And on the eighth day, she will bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, at the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony, for a sin offering and for a burnt offering.
Leviticus 15:30 The priest, offering one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, will pray for her before the Lord concerning her discharge of uncleanness.
Leviticus 15:31 In this way, you are to teach the children of Israel to be careful regarding ritual uncleanness, so that they do not die in their defilements when they would otherwise pollute My sanctuary, which is in their midst.
Leviticus 15:32 This is the law for the man who has a discharge of semen, and for the man who becomes defiled through intercourse.
Leviticus 15:33 It is also the law for a menstruating woman, and for a woman who suffers a discharge of blood, and for both a man and a woman who have intercourse with each other.
Leviticus 16:1 The Lord spoke to Moses after Aaron’s two sons had died, when they were killed for offering unauthorized fire, which was not according to God's command.
Leviticus 16:2 And He said to him: "Speak to your brother Aaron and instruct him that he is not to enter the Most Holy Place, which is inside the veil and before the mercy seat that covers the Ark of the Covenant, whenever he wishes. If he does, he will die, because I will appear in a cloud over the mercy seat and execute judgment."
Leviticus 16:3 Aaron is to enter the Most Holy Place with these offerings: a young bull from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus 16:4 He is to put on a linen tunic, linen trousers for modesty, a linen sash, and a linen turban. These are holy garments, and he must bathe his entire body before putting them on.
Leviticus 16:5 From the entire assembly of the children of Israel, he is to take two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.
Leviticus 16:6 When Aaron offers the young bull as his own sin offering, he will make atonement for himself and for his household.
Leviticus 16:7 He will then take the two male goats and present them before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus 16:8 Aaron will cast lots for the two goats: one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for Azazel, the scapegoat.
Leviticus 16:9 The goat on which the lot for the Lord falls, Aaron will offer as a sin offering.
Leviticus 16:10 But the goat on which the lot for Azazel falls, he will present alive before the Lord. It will then be sent out into the wilderness to make atonement for the people by bearing their sins.
Leviticus 16:11 After Aaron offers his young bull as a sin offering and his ram as a burnt offering, he will make atonement for himself and for his household.
Leviticus 16:12 He will then take a censer full of burning coals from the altar, and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and bring them inside the veil.
Leviticus 16:13 So that when he puts the incense on the burning coals, the cloud of incense smoke will cover the mercy seat that is on the Ark of the Covenant, so he will not die.
Leviticus 16:14 He will also take some of the blood from the young bull and sprinkle it with his finger seven times on the eastern side of the mercy seat.
Leviticus 16:15 Then he will slaughter the goat for the people's sin offering and bring its blood inside the veil. He will do with its blood just as he did with the blood of the young bull, sprinkling it against the mercy seat.
Leviticus 16:16 In this way, he will cleanse the Most Holy Place from the defilement of the children of Israel, from their transgressions, and from all their sins. He will do the same ritual for the tent of meeting, which is pitched among them in the midst of their impure dwelling.
Leviticus 16:17 No one is to be in the tent of meeting when the high priest enters the Most Holy Place to make atonement for himself, for his household, and for the entire assembly of Israel, until he comes out.
Leviticus 16:18 When he comes out to the altar that is before the Lord, he will make atonement for himself and for the people, and he will consecrate it.
Leviticus 16:19 He will sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times with his finger, purifying and consecrating it from the defilement of the children of Israel.
Leviticus 16:20 After he has finished cleansing the Most Holy Place, the tent of meeting, and the altar, he will bring forward the live goat.
Leviticus 16:21 He will lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, all their transgressions, and all their sins. He will put these sins onto the head of the goat, and then send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man appointed for this task.
Leviticus 16:22 As the goat carries all their iniquities into an uninhabited land and is released into the wilderness, it signifies the removal of their sins.
Leviticus 16:23 Aaron will then go back into the tent of meeting, take off the linen garments he wore when he entered the Most Holy Place, and leave them there.
Leviticus 16:24 He will bathe his entire body with water in a holy place, and then put on his regular priestly garments. After he comes out, he will offer his own burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, making atonement for himself and for the people.
Leviticus 16:25 He will burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
Leviticus 16:26 The man who led the scapegoat away will wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, and after that, he may return to the camp.
Leviticus 16:27 The young bull and the goat that were offered for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make atonement, will be carried outside the camp. Their hides, flesh, and dung will be burned with fire.
Leviticus 16:28 Anyone who burns them will wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, and after that, he may return to the camp.
Leviticus 16:29 This is to be a perpetual statute for you: On the tenth day of the seventh month, you are to afflict your souls—a solemn fast and time of repentance. You must not do any work, whether you are a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you.
Leviticus 16:30 For on this Day of Atonement, you will be purified and cleansed from all your sins. Before the Lord, you will be made clean.
Leviticus 16:31 This is a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you are to afflict your souls, as a perpetual ordinance.
Leviticus 16:32 The atonement will be made by the priest who has been anointed and consecrated to serve as high priest in his father's place. He is to put on the sacred linen garments.
Leviticus 16:33 He will make atonement for the Most Holy Place, for the tent of meeting, and for the altar. He will also make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
Leviticus 16:34 This is to be a perpetual statute for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel and for all their sins once a year. So Aaron did exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Leviticus 17:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him these instructions:
Leviticus 17:2 “Speak to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, saying: This is the command that the Lord has issued:
Leviticus 17:3 Any man from the house of Israel, or from among the foreigners who reside among you, who slaughters an animal for sacrifice—whether an ox, a sheep, or a goat—inside the camp or outside the camp,
Leviticus 17:4 and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Witness to offer it to the Lord, that man will be considered guilty of bloodshed, just as if he had shed human blood. Therefore, that person will be cut off from among his people.
Leviticus 17:5 For this reason, the priests, the sons of Israel, must bring their offerings to the Lord at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Witness, and there they shall slaughter their peace offerings to the Lord.
Leviticus 17:6 They shall pour the blood upon the Lord’s altar at the entrance of the Tabernacle of Witness, and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 17:7 They shall never again offer their sacrifices to pagan deities, with whom they have prostituted themselves through idolatry. This will be a perpetual statute for them and for their descendants.
Leviticus 17:8 Also say to them: Any man from the house of Israel, or from among the foreigners who reside among you, who offers a burnt offering or any other sacrifice,
Leviticus 17:9 and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tabernacle of Witness to offer it to the Lord, that person will be cut off from his people.
Leviticus 17:10 Furthermore, any man from the house of Israel, or from among the foreigners who reside among them, who eats blood—I will set My face against that person, and I will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus 17:11 This is because the very life-force of the flesh is in the blood. I have given this blood to you to pour on the altar, so that you may make atonement for your souls, because it is the blood that must make atonement for a soul.
Leviticus 17:12 Therefore, I have said to the sons of Israel: No person among you shall eat blood, nor shall any of the foreigners who reside among you eat blood.
Leviticus 17:13 Also, any man from the sons of Israel, or from among the foreigners who reside among you, who hunts and catches a wild animal or a bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.
Leviticus 17:14 For the life-force of all flesh is in its blood. This is why I have said to the sons of Israel: You shall not eat the blood of any flesh, because the life-force of the flesh is in its blood. And whoever eats it will be cut off.
Leviticus 17:15 Any person who eats an animal that died naturally or was torn by a wild beast—whether an Israelite native or a foreigner—must wash his clothes and himself with water. He will be ritually unclean until evening; only then will he become clean through this ritual.
Leviticus 17:16 But if he does not wash his clothes and his body, he will bear the consequence of his sin and uncleanliness.
Leviticus 18:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him these instructions:
Leviticus 18:2 “Tell the children of Israel this: I am the Lord, your God.
Leviticus 18:3 Do not imitate the customs of Egypt, where you once lived. And do not adopt the practices of the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. You must not follow their traditions and laws.
Leviticus 18:4 Instead, you must obey my judgments. You must keep my commandments and live according to them. I am the Lord, your God.
Leviticus 18:5 You must keep my statutes and my judgments. A person who obeys them will truly live and flourish because of them. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 18:6 No man shall approach any close relative to engage in sexual acts that expose her nakedness. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 18:7 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father or your mother. She is your mother; you must not expose her nakedness.
Leviticus 18:8 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife. This would be uncovering your father’s nakedness.
Leviticus 18:9 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, whether she is your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, and whether she was born in your home or outside it. You must not do this.
Leviticus 18:10 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter. These are your own nakedness, because they are your direct descendants.
Leviticus 18:11 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter—she who was born to your father, who is therefore your sister. You must not do this.
Leviticus 18:12 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister. She is your father’s flesh and blood.
Leviticus 18:13 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother-in-law. She is your wife’s mother, who is like your own mother.
Leviticus 18:14 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother. And you shall not approach his wife to have relations with her, for she is your close relative.
Leviticus 18:15 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife, and for that reason, you must not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus 18:16 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife. This would be uncovering your brother’s nakedness.
Leviticus 18:17 You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter. You shall not take her daughter, nor her granddaughter born from that daughter, to uncover their ignominy. They are too closely related to her, and such unions are forbidden.
Leviticus 18:18 You shall not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife while your wife is still living, nor uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus 18:19 You shall not approach a woman who is in her menstrual period, nor uncover her nakedness while she is in this state.
Leviticus 18:20 You shall not lie with your neighbor’s wife, nor defile yourself with an emission of seed through such mixing.
Leviticus 18:21 You shall not give any of your offspring to be consecrated to Moloch, nor shall you profane the name of your God. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 18:22 You shall not lie with a male as you would with a woman. This is an abomination.
Leviticus 18:23 You shall not lie with any beast to defile yourself. Nor shall a woman offer herself to a beast to lie with it. This is an abomination.
Leviticus 18:24 Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices. For it is with all these defilements that the nations—whom I am driving out before you—have polluted themselves.
Leviticus 18:25 The land itself became defiled. Therefore, I will punish its iniquity, and the land will literally vomit out its inhabitants.
Leviticus 18:26 You, therefore, must keep my statutes and my judgments. For whoever commits any of these abominations will be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus 18:27 For all these abominations were committed by the inhabitants of the land who were before you, and they thereby polluted the land.
Leviticus 18:28 Beware, then, that the land does not also vomit you out, if you commit any such thing, just as it has vomited out the nation that was before you.
Leviticus 18:29 Every person who commits any of these abominations will be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus 18:30 Therefore, keep my commands. Do not follow the ordinances of those who were before you in these matters, and do not defile yourselves by them. I am the Lord, your God.
Leviticus 19:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 19:2 “Speak to all the assembled people of Israel, and say to them: 'You shall be holy, because I, the Lord your God, am holy.'
Leviticus 19:3 'Every one of you shall reverence his mother and his father. You shall keep My Sabbaths. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus 19:4 'Do not turn to idols, nor make for yourselves molten gods. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus 19:5 'When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord, to be acceptable, you shall offer it willingly.
Leviticus 19:6 'It shall be eaten on the same day that it is offered, and on the next day. Whatever remains until the third day shall be burned with fire.
Leviticus 19:7 'If anyone eats anything from it on the third day, the sacrifice will be defiled, and it will not please the one who offered it:
Leviticus 19:8 'The person who eats it will bear his guilt, because he has profaned what is holy to the Lord. That soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus 19:9 'When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely clear the corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.
Leviticus 19:10 'Nor shall you gather the fallen grapes from your vineyard or the stray berries. You shall leave them to be gathered by the poor and the stranger. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus 19:11 'You shall not steal. You shall not lie, nor shall any one of you deceive his neighbor.
Leviticus 19:12 'You shall not swear falsely by My Name, nor shall you profane the Name of your God. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 19:13 'You shall not defraud your neighbor, nor oppress him by violence. The wages of a hired worker shall not remain with you until morning.
Leviticus 19:14 'You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind. Instead, you shall fear the Lord your God, because I am the Lord.
Leviticus 19:15 'You shall do no injustice in judgment. You shall not be partial to the poor, nor show deference to the powerful. You shall judge your neighbor justly.
Leviticus 19:16 'You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people. You shall not stand by idly while your neighbor's life is at risk. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 19:17 'You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall openly rebuke your neighbor, so that you do not bear sin because of him.
Leviticus 19:18 'You shall not seek revenge, nor harbor anger against your fellow citizens. You shall love your friend as yourself. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 19:19 'You shall keep My statutes. You shall not let your cattle breed with a different kind of animal. You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed. You shall not wear a garment woven from two different kinds of material.
Leviticus 19:20 'If a man sleeps with a woman in an act of sexual intercourse, and she is a female slave betrothed to a husband, but has not yet been redeemed or given her freedom, they both shall be punished with scourging; they shall not be put to death, because she was not yet free.
Leviticus 19:21 'But for his guilt, he shall bring a ram to the Lord at the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony as an offering.
Leviticus 19:22 'And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord for the sin he has committed, and the sin he committed shall be forgiven him.
Leviticus 19:23 'When you enter the land and plant any fruit-bearing trees, you shall count their fruit as uncircumcised, meaning it is forbidden. For three years, it shall be considered unclean to you; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus 19:24 'In the fourth year, all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the Lord.
Leviticus 19:25 'But in the fifth year you may eat of its fruit, gathering its produce. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus 19:26 'You shall not eat anything with blood. You shall not practice divination or observe omens.
Leviticus 19:27 'You shall not cut the hair on your head in a circular fashion, nor shall you shave off the edges of your beard.
Leviticus 19:28 'You shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead, nor put any tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 19:29 'Do not prostitute your daughter, lest the land become defiled and filled with wickedness.
Leviticus 19:30 'You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 19:31 'Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus 19:32 'You shall rise up before the gray head and honor the person of the elderly; and you shall fear the Lord your God. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 19:33 'If a stranger lives with you in your land, you shall not oppress him.
Leviticus 19:34 'But the stranger who lives among you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you too were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus 19:35 'You shall do no injustice in judgment, in measures of length, in weight, or in liquid measure.
Leviticus 19:36 'You shall have honest scales, honest weights, an honest dry measure (ephah), and an honest liquid measure (hin). I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Leviticus 19:37 'Therefore, you shall observe all My statutes and all My judgments, and you shall do them. I am the Lord.'
Leviticus 20:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 20:2 Speak to the children of Israel: If anyone, whether an Israelite or a foreigner dwelling among you, gives their child to be sacrificed to the idol Moloch, that person must certainly be put to death. The people will stone them with stones.
Leviticus 20:3 And I will set My face against that person, and I will cut them off from among their people. I will also cut off their children who were given to Moloch, because they have defiled My Sanctuary and profaned My holy name.
Leviticus 20:4 If the people of the land neglect their duty and pretend not to see the one who gives their child to Moloch, and do not put that person to death,
Leviticus 20:5 then I will set My face against that person and against their family. And I will cut them off, along with all those who consented to them in their idolatry and spiritual fornication with Moloch, from among their people.
Leviticus 20:6 The soul who turns to mediums or diviners, and engages in spiritual fornication with them, I will set My face against that soul and cut them off from among their people.
Leviticus 20:7 Sanctify yourselves and be holy, because I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus 20:8 Keep My commandments and do them. I am the Lord who sanctifies you—the One who sets you apart for holiness.
Leviticus 20:9 Anyone who curses their father or mother must certainly be put to death. Their blood will be upon them, because they cursed their father and mother.
Leviticus 20:10 If a man commits adultery with the wife of another man, and he engages in illicit sexual relations with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress must certainly be put to death.
Leviticus 20:11 If a man lies with his stepmother and reveals his father’s nakedness (meaning, dishonors his father), he must certainly be put to death. His blood will be upon him.
Leviticus 20:12 If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them must certainly be put to death. They have committed a depraved act. Their blood will be upon them.
Leviticus 20:13 If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. Both must certainly be put to death. Their blood will be upon them.
Leviticus 20:14 If a man marries a woman and her mother, he has committed a depraved act. He shall be burned with fire along with them, and he will not remain among his people.
Leviticus 20:15 If a man lies with an animal, he must certainly be put to death. And you must also kill the animal.
Leviticus 20:16 If a woman approaches an animal to lie with it and mixes herself with it, both she and the animal must be put to death. Their blood will be upon them.
Leviticus 20:17 If a man takes his sister, whether his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and sees her nakedness (meaning, has sexual relations with her), and she in turn sees his disgrace, it is a depraved act. They shall be put to death naked in the sight of their people, and they will bear the consequence of their iniquity.
Leviticus 20:18 If a man lies with a woman during her menstrual period and uncovers her nakedness (meaning, has sexual relations with her) and exposes her menstrual flow, both of them shall perish from among their people.
Leviticus 20:19 You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or your father’s sister (meaning, have sexual relations with your aunt), for whoever does this reveals the disgrace of his own flesh. They will bear the consequence of their iniquity.
Leviticus 20:20 If a man lies with his uncle’s wife (meaning, his aunt by marriage) and reveals the disgrace of his relative, he has committed a depraved act. They will bear the consequence of their iniquity. They will die childless.
Leviticus 20:21 If a man takes his brother’s wife, he has committed a disgraceful act. He has revealed his brother’s nakedness (meaning, dishonored his brother). He will die childless.
Leviticus 20:22 Keep My statutes and My judgments, and do them, so that the land into which you are entering to dwell may not vomit you out.
Leviticus 20:23 Do not walk in the customs of the nations whom I am driving out before you. For they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
Leviticus 20:24 But I have said to you: Possess their land, and I will give it to you as an inheritance—a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the Lord your God, who has separated you from other peoples.
Leviticus 20:25 Therefore, you must also separate the clean animal from the unclean, and the clean bird from the unclean. Do not defile yourselves with animals, or with birds, or with anything that creeps on the earth, which I have shown you to be unclean.
Leviticus 20:26 Be holy to Me, for I am holy, the Lord your God. And I have separated you from the peoples, so that you may be Mine.
Leviticus 20:27 A man or a woman who has a pythonic spirit (meaning, a spirit of divination or necromancy) or a spirit of sorcery must certainly be put to death. They will be stoned with stones. Their blood will be upon them.
Leviticus 21:1 The Lord God also spoke to Moses, saying: 'Speak to Aaron's sons, who are the priests, and tell them this: They must not make themselves unclean because of a dead body among their own people.'
Leviticus 21:2 They may, however, make themselves unclean for a close relative who is their flesh and blood: meaning their mother, father, son, daughter, or brother,
Leviticus 21:3 or for their virgin sister who has not yet married.
Leviticus 21:4 A priest must not defile himself on account of a chief man among his people, nor become ritually unclean on that account.
Leviticus 21:5 They must not shave their heads bald, nor shave the edges of their beards in an unholy way, nor make any cuts on their bodies.
Leviticus 21:6 They must be holy to the Lord their God, and they must not profane His holy name, because they offer the Lord's sacrifices by fire and the food of their God, and therefore they must be holy.
Leviticus 21:7 They must not marry a prostitute, nor a woman who has been defiled by prostitution, nor a woman divorced from her husband: for they are consecrated to their God.
Leviticus 21:8 You must treat him as holy, because he offers the food of your God, and he must be pure to you: for I am the Lord, who sanctifies you.
Leviticus 21:9 If a priest's daughter is caught in prostitution, and thereby profanes the holiness of her father's name, she must be burned with fire.
Leviticus 21:10 The high priest, who is the greatest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil has been poured, and whose hands have been consecrated for the priesthood, and who is clothed in holy garments, must not uncover his head, nor tear his garments in mourning.
Leviticus 21:11 He must not go near any dead body at all: he must not make himself unclean, even for his own father or mother.
Leviticus 21:12 He must not leave the holy place of the tabernacle so that he does not profane the Lord's sanctuary: for the oil of the holy anointing of his God is upon him. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 21:13 He must marry a virgin.
Leviticus 21:14 He must not marry a widow, or a divorced woman, or a woman who has been defiled by prostitution, or a prostitute: instead, he must marry a virgin from his own people.
Leviticus 21:15 so that he does not defile his offspring among his people, because I am the Lord who has sanctified him.
Leviticus 21:16 The Lord God also spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 21:17 Speak to Aaron: No man among your descendants, throughout their generations, who has a blemish or defect in his body, may offer the food of his God,
Leviticus 21:18 nor may he approach to minister to Him.
Leviticus 21:19 If there is any man who is blind, or lame, or who has a small, or a large, or a twisted nose,
Leviticus 21:20 or who is a hunchback, or has an eye disease, or who has a white spot over the pupil of his eyes, or who has a chronic skin disease, or ringworm on his body, or a broken limb.
Leviticus 21:21 Anyone among the descendants of Aaron who has such a blemish or defect, must not approach to minister to the Lord, nor to offer gifts to Him.
Leviticus 21:22 However, he may eat from the showbread and from the other holy offerings.
Leviticus 21:23 provided that he does not go inside the veil, nor approach the altar, because he has a blemish or defect, and he must not profane My sanctuary. I am the Lord who sanctifies them.
Leviticus 21:24 So Moses spoke these words to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.
Leviticus 22:1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 22:2 Speak to Aaron and his sons, warning them to be careful with the holy offerings that the sons of Israel have consecrated. They must not defile My holy name, which I have sanctified for Myself, for I am the Lord.
Leviticus 22:3 Say to them: Any man from your priestly lineage who approaches the holy offerings consecrated and presented to the Lord by the sons of Israel, while he is in a state of ritual uncleanness, will be cut off from My presence and face divine punishment. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 22:4 No man from the lineage of Aaron, if he has leprosy or a discharge, is to eat from the things that have been sanctified for Me, until he becomes ritually clean. Likewise, anyone who touches a person unclean due to a dead body or who has a seminal emission,
Leviticus 22:5 or who touches any creeping thing by which he becomes defiled, or a man by whose touch he himself becomes unclean—that person will be unclean until evening.
Leviticus 22:6 He must not eat from the holy offerings until he has purified himself. Instead, he must wash his body with water.
Leviticus 22:7 When the sun has set, he will be clean. After that, he may eat from the holy offerings, because these are his priestly food.
Leviticus 22:8 They—meaning the priests—must not eat any animal that has died a natural death or that has been torn by wild beasts, so that they do not become defiled by eating such things. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 22:9 They must keep My commands, so that they do not sin and die in the sanctuary, by defiling it. I am the Lord, who sanctifies them, setting them apart for My service.
Leviticus 22:10 No unauthorized person, meaning anyone not from the priestly lineage, is to eat from the holy offerings. A guest living with the priest, or a hired servant, must not eat of them.
Leviticus 22:11 However, if a priest purchases a servant as property, that servant is part of his household and may eat from the holy offerings. And those who are born into his household, his own domestic servants, may also eat of his priestly food.
Leviticus 22:12 If a priest's daughter marries an unauthorized layman, she must not eat from the holy offerings or the firstfruits—these are reserved for the priestly family.
Leviticus 22:13 But if a priest's daughter becomes a widow or is divorced, and has no children, and she returns to her father's household just as she was before her marriage, she may again eat of her father's priestly food. However, no unauthorized person is permitted to eat from these offerings.
Leviticus 22:14 If someone, through inadvertent error, eats from the holy offerings, he must add a fifth of its value to what he ate and give it to the priest as restitution.
Leviticus 22:15 And the sons of Israel must not defile the holy offerings consecrated and presented to the Lord,
Leviticus 22:16 lest they bear the guilt of their sin when they eat those holy things while in a state of impurity. I am the Lord, who sanctifies them.
Leviticus 22:17 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 22:18 Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, saying to them: If any man from the house of Israel, or from the resident foreigners among Israel, offers his gift—whether to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering—whatever it may be that is to be offered to the Lord as a burnt offering,
Leviticus 22:19 for it to be accepted and pleasing to God, it must be an unblemished male from the cattle, sheep, or goats.
Leviticus 22:20 You must not offer anything that has a blemish or defect, because such an offering will not be accepted as an atonement for you.
Leviticus 22:21 If a man offers a peace offering to the Lord, whether to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, from either cattle or sheep, he must offer it unblemished so that it may be acceptable to God. There must be no defect in it whatsoever.
Leviticus 22:22 You must not offer to the Lord any animal that is blind, or has a broken limb, or a wound, or is afflicted with warts, or is scabby, or has mange. You must not present any of these with a fire offering upon the Lord's altar.
Leviticus 22:23 You may offer a bull or a lamb that has a limb too long or too short as a freewill offering. However, it cannot be accepted to fulfill a vow, as it is not perfect.
Leviticus 22:24 You must not offer to the Lord any animal whose testicles are crushed, bruised, torn, or cut off. You must not do any of these things within your land, meaning you should not mutilate animals in this way for offerings.
Leviticus 22:25 You must not accept such offerings, meaning blemished animals, from the hand of a foreigner to present as food offerings to your God, or for any other purpose you intend to give to Him. This is because all such animals are corrupt and blemished, and therefore they will not be accepted by God.
Leviticus 22:26 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 22:27 When a bull, a sheep, or a goat is born, it must remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day onward, it may be offered to the Lord as an acceptable sacrifice.
Leviticus 22:28 Whether it is a cow or a ewe, you must not slaughter it and its offspring on the same day.
Leviticus 22:29 If you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Lord, so that you may be pleasing to Him, you must offer it voluntarily and sincerely.
Leviticus 22:30 You must eat it on the same day it is offered. Nothing of it is to remain until the morning of the next day. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 22:31 Keep My commandments and perform them exactly as I have instructed. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 22:32 You must not profane My holy name, so that I may be sanctified and honored among the sons of Israel. I am the Lord, who sanctifies you and sets you apart.
Leviticus 22:33 who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God and your protector. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 23:1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 23:2 “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: These are the Lord's solemn feasts, which you shall celebrate in their appointed times.
Leviticus 23:3 Six days you shall do work. But the seventh day is the Sabbath, a holy rest; you shall do no work on it. It is the Lord's Sabbath throughout all your dwellings.
Leviticus 23:4 These then are the Lord's most holy celebrations, which you shall observe in their seasons.
Leviticus 23:5 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, is the Lord's Passover.
Leviticus 23:6 And on the fifteenth day of this same month, is the Lord's solemn feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days, you shall eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus 23:7 The first day shall be a most solemn assembly for you, and you shall do no servile work on it.
Leviticus 23:8 But you shall offer burnt offerings by fire to the Lord for seven days. And the seventh day shall be held in veneration, and you shall do no servile work on it.”
Leviticus 23:9 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 23:10 “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: When you have entered the land which I will give you, and you have reaped its harvest, you shall bring sheaves of grain, the firstfruits of your harvest, to the priest.
Leviticus 23:11 He shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, that it may be accepted for you, on the day after the Sabbath, and he shall consecrate it.
Leviticus 23:12 And on the day when the sheaf is waved, you shall offer a spotless year-old lamb as a burnt offering to the Lord.
Leviticus 23:13 And its accompanying sacrifices shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, as a burnt offering by fire to the Lord, for a most sweet aroma. Its libations also shall be wine, a fourth part of a hin.
Leviticus 23:14 You shall not eat bread, nor parched grain, nor any old produce from your harvest, until you have offered something of these to your God. This is an everlasting commandment throughout all your generations and in all your dwellings.”
Leviticus 23:15 “Therefore, you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, on which you brought the sheaf of the firstfruits, seven full weeks.
Leviticus 23:16 You shall count until the day after the completion of the seventh week—that is, fifty days. And then you shall offer a new sacrifice to the Lord.
Leviticus 23:17 From all your dwellings, you shall bring two loaves of bread as firstfruits to the Lord, two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour, baked with leaven, which you shall bake yourselves.
Leviticus 23:18 And with the bread, you shall offer seven spotless year-old lambs, and one bull from the herd, and two rams. These shall be a burnt offering, with their accompanying sacrifices and libations, for a most sweet aroma to the Lord.
Leviticus 23:19 You shall also offer one male goat as a sin offering, and two year-old lambs as sacrifices of peace offerings.
Leviticus 23:20 When the priest has waved the bread with the lambs before the Lord, they shall be consecrated to the priest.
Leviticus 23:21 And they shall belong to him. He shall also proclaim and announce on this very day a most solemn and holy convocation. You shall do no servile work on it. This shall be an everlasting statute throughout all your dwellings and in your generations.”
Leviticus 23:22 “When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very edge of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest. Instead, you shall leave them for the poor and for the strangers. I am the Lord your God.”
Leviticus 23:23 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 23:24 “Speak to the children of Israel: In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a Sabbath—a solemn feast of remembrance, announced by the blowing of trumpets—and a holy convocation.
Leviticus 23:25 You shall do no servile work on it, and you shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord.”
Leviticus 23:26 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 23:27 “On the tenth day of this seventh month, there shall be the most solemn Day of Atonement, and it shall be called holy. You shall afflict your souls on it, and you shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord.
Leviticus 23:28 You shall do no work on this day, for it is the Day of Propitiation, so that the Lord your God may make propitiation for you.
Leviticus 23:29 Every soul who has not afflicted himself on this day shall perish from among his people.
Leviticus 23:30 And whoever does any work, I will destroy that soul from among his people.
Leviticus 23:31 You shall do no work. This shall be an everlasting statute for you throughout all your generations and dwellings.
Leviticus 23:32 It is a Sabbath of rest from evening until evening. You shall celebrate your Sabbaths.”
Leviticus 23:33 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 23:34 “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: From the fifteenth day of this seventh month, for seven days, there shall be the solemn Feast of Tabernacles to the Lord.
Leviticus 23:35 The first day shall be a most solemn and holy assembly. You shall do no servile work on it.
Leviticus 23:36 For seven days you shall offer burnt offerings to the Lord. And on the eighth day, there shall be a most solemn and holy convocation, and you shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord. For it is a day of conclusion and assembly, and you shall do no servile work on it.
Leviticus 23:37 These are the Lord's festivals, which you shall celebrate with most holy convocations, and in them you shall offer oblations to the Lord: burnt offerings and sacrifices, libations and victims, each on its proper day.
Leviticus 23:38 These are in addition to the Lord's Sabbaths, and your gifts, and all that you offer to the Lord by vow or by freewill.
Leviticus 23:39 Therefore, from the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered all the produce of your land, you shall celebrate the Lord's solemn feast for seven days. On the first day and on the eighth day, there shall be a Sabbath—that is, a day of rest.
Leviticus 23:40 And on the first day, you shall take for yourselves the fruit of a beautiful tree, and branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick-leaved trees, and willows from the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days.”
Leviticus 24:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 24:2 "Command the children of Israel to bring you the purest and clearest olive oil, so that the lamps can be kept lit continually.
Leviticus 24:3 This is to be done outside the veil of testimony, within the tabernacle of the covenant. The lamps must burn from evening until morning before the Lord without fail, an everlasting law for all your descendants.
Leviticus 24:4 The lamps upon the lampstand, which is made of pure gold, must always be kept trimmed and burning before the Lord's presence.
Leviticus 24:5 You shall also take fine flour and bake twelve loaves from it, each loaf made with two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour.
Leviticus 24:6 You shall place them, in two stacks of six loaves each, upon the table of pure gold before the Lord.
Leviticus 24:7 You shall place pure frankincense upon each stack, so that the bread may serve as a memorial portion, an offering to the Lord.
Leviticus 24:8 These loaves shall be changed out every Sabbath before the Lord, received from the children of Israel as an everlasting covenant.
Leviticus 24:9 And these loaves shall be for Aaron and his sons to eat in a most holy place, because they are a most holy portion from the Lord's offerings, belonging to them by an everlasting right.
Leviticus 24:10 Now, the son of an Israelite woman—who had an Egyptian father—came out among the children of Israel. This man got into a quarrel in the camp with another Israelite.
Leviticus 24:11 And this man blasphemed the Lord's Name and cursed Him. Because of this, he was brought to Moses.
Leviticus 24:12 His mother's name was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, from the tribe of Dan.
Leviticus 24:13 They put him in custody until they could learn what the Lord's command would be concerning him.
Leviticus 24:14 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Leviticus 24:15 "Take the one who blasphemed outside the camp. Let all who heard his blasphemy lay their hands upon his head as witnesses. Then, let the entire congregation of the children of Israel stone him to death."
Leviticus 24:16 And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: 'Whoever curses his God shall bear the full consequence for his sin.'
Leviticus 24:17 And whoever strikes and kills any person must be put to death.
Leviticus 24:18 Whoever strikes and kills an animal must make restitution, paying back life for life.
Leviticus 24:19 If anyone injures his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him:
Leviticus 24:20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Whatever injury or blemish he inflicted, such shall he be compelled to suffer.
Leviticus 24:21 Whoever strikes and kills a human being shall be put to death. But whoever wounds or kills an animal shall make restitution for it.
Leviticus 24:22 You shall have the same law for both the foreigner and the native-born person who has sinned, because I am the Lord your God.
Leviticus 24:23 So Moses spoke to the children of Israel. They led the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him to death. The children of Israel did exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Leviticus 25:1 Then the Lord God spoke to Moses while he was on Mount Sinai, saying:
Leviticus 25:2 Say this to the people of Israel:
“When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land itself must also keep a Sabbath rest for the Lord.
Leviticus 25:3 For six years, you may sow your fields and prune your vineyards, and gather their produce.
Leviticus 25:4 But during the seventh year, the land itself must have a full rest, a Sabbath for the Lord.
You must not sow your field or prune your vineyard during that year.
Leviticus 25:5 Do not harvest whatever grows naturally from your previous crop, and do not gather the grapes from your unpruned vines, even those that bear fruit on their own.
It is a year of holy rest for the land.
Leviticus 25:6 But whatever the land yields during its Sabbath rest will be food for you—for yourself and your servants, your male and female slaves, your hired workers, and any foreign residents who live with you.
Leviticus 25:7 All the produce of the land during that year will also be food for your livestock and for all the wild animals that are in your land.”
Leviticus 25:8 Then you must count seven Sabbath years—seven times seven years.
This totals forty-nine years.
Leviticus 25:9 On the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Day of Atonement, you must sound the ram’s horn loudly throughout all your land.
This will mark the fiftieth year as a holy year for you.
You must proclaim liberation throughout the land for all its inhabitants.
This year will be the Jubilee for you.
Leviticus 25:10 The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for you.
You must not sow, nor reap what grows of itself, nor gather grapes from the unpruned vines.
Leviticus 25:11 Because it is the Jubilee, it will be holy to you; you will eat what the fields produce naturally.
Leviticus 25:12 In this year of Jubilee, every person must return to their family property and to their ancestral clan.
Leviticus 25:13 When you make a sale to your neighbor or buy anything from him, you must not cheat one another.
The price of the land will depend on the number of years remaining until the next Jubilee.
Leviticus 25:14 You will buy from your neighbor according to the number of harvests remaining before the Jubilee.
Leviticus 25:15 If there are many years left until the Jubilee, you will increase the price; if there are only a few years left, you will reduce the price.
It is the number of harvests, not the land itself, that he is selling to you.
Leviticus 25:16 You must not oppress one another.
Instead, you must fear your God, because I am the Lord God, your God.
Leviticus 25:17 You must follow My statutes and keep My ordinances and obey them.
Then you will live securely in the land, without any fear.
Leviticus 25:18 The land will yield its produce, and you will eat your fill, and you will dwell in it without dread.
Leviticus 25:19 If you ask, “What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow or gather our produce?”
Leviticus 25:20 I will send My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it will produce enough grain for three years.
Leviticus 25:21 So you will sow in the eighth year, but you will still be eating from the old produce until the ninth year, until the new harvest comes in.
Leviticus 25:22 The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is Mine, and you are merely My temporary residents and tenants.
Leviticus 25:23 Therefore, for all the land of your possession, you must provide for the right of redemption when it is sold.
Leviticus 25:24 If your kinsman, a fellow Israelite, becomes poor and sells some of his family property, then his nearest relative who can redeem it must come and buy back what his kinsman sold.
Leviticus 25:25 If a man has no one to redeem it for him, but he himself later acquires sufficient means to redeem it,
Leviticus 25:26 then he must calculate the years since the sale, deduct the value of the produce taken by the buyer, and repay the remainder to the man who bought it.
Then the property will return to him.
Leviticus 25:27 But if he cannot afford to buy it back, then what he sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee.
In the Jubilee, it will be released, and the property will revert to the original owner.
Leviticus 25:28 If someone sells a dwelling house inside a walled city, he retains the right to redeem it for a full year after the sale.
Leviticus 25:29 If it is not redeemed within a full year, then the house within the walled city will belong permanently to the buyer and his descendants.
It will not revert to the original owner in the Jubilee.
Leviticus 25:30 But houses in unwalled villages must be treated as open country.
They may be redeemed at any time, and they will revert to the original owner in the Jubilee.
Leviticus 25:31 However, the houses in the Levitical cities, which are designated cities for the Levites, may always be redeemed by the Levites.
Leviticus 25:32 If a Levite sells a house in a Levitical city, it will revert to him in the Jubilee, because the houses in the Levitical cities are their perpetual possession among the people of Israel.
Leviticus 25:33 The pasturelands around their cities, however, cannot be sold, because they are their permanent possession for all time.
Leviticus 25:34 If your kinsman, a fellow Israelite, becomes poor and unable to support himself, you must help him, just as you would help a foreign resident or a temporary settler, so that he can live among you.
Leviticus 25:35 Do not charge him interest on the money you lend him, or take any profit from him.
Instead, you must fear your God, so that your kinsman can continue to live alongside you.
Leviticus 25:36 You must not lend him money at interest, nor sell him food for profit.
Leviticus 25:37 I am the Lord God, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
Leviticus 25:38 If your kinsman, a fellow Israelite, becomes poor and sells himself to you, you must not make him serve as a common slave.
Leviticus 25:39 He must be treated like a hired worker or a temporary resident among you; he will serve you only until the Year of Jubilee.
Leviticus 25:40 Then he and his children with him will be released from you, and he will return to his family and to the family property of his ancestors.
Leviticus 26:1 You shall not make idols for yourselves, nor set up any carved images or sacred pillars, nor place any notable stone in your land for the purpose of worshiping it. For I am the Lord, your God.
Leviticus 26:2 Keep my Sabbaths and revere my sanctuary. I am the Lord.
Leviticus 26:3 If you live according to my commands, and carefully obey my commandments, putting them into practice,
Leviticus 26:4 then I will give you rain at the proper times, and the land will produce its crops, and the trees will be filled with fruit.
Leviticus 26:5 Your threshing season will last until the harvest time, and your grape harvest will extend until planting time. You will eat your fill of bread, and you will live securely in your land, without fear.
Leviticus 26:6 I will bring peace to your land; you will sleep soundly, and no one will make you afraid. I will remove dangerous animals, and no army will invade your land.
Leviticus 26:7 You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you.
Leviticus 26:8 Five of you will put one hundred of your enemies to flight, and one hundred of you will put ten thousand to flight. And your enemies will fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus 26:9 I will look favorably upon you and I will make you fruitful; you will multiply greatly, and I will confirm my covenant with you.
Leviticus 26:10 You will still be eating from last year's plentiful harvest when you must clear space for the new harvest.
Leviticus 26:11 I will set my tabernacle among you, and my soul will not reject you.
Leviticus 26:12 I will walk among you, and I will be your God, and you will be my people.
Leviticus 26:13 I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt so that you would not be slaves to them. I who broke the yoke of your slavery from your necks and made you walk with your heads held high.
Leviticus 26:14 But if you will not listen to me, nor do all my commandments,
Leviticus 26:15 if you despise my laws and scorn my judgments by refusing to do what I have commanded, and thereby break my covenant:
Leviticus 26:16 I, in turn, will do this to you: I will swiftly punish you with misery and with a burning fever that will dim your eyes and waste away your lives. You will sow your seed in vain, because your enemies will devour it.
Leviticus 26:17 I will turn my face against you, and you will fall before your enemies. You will be ruled by those who hate you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you.
Leviticus 26:18 If even after these things you will not listen to me, I will add seven times more plagues upon you for your sins.
Leviticus 26:19 I will break your pride, and I will make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze, yielding nothing.
Leviticus 26:20 Your labor will be futile from now on, for the land will not yield its crops, nor will the trees produce their fruit.
Leviticus 26:21 If you continue to walk in hostility toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will increase your plagues sevenfold according to your sins.
Leviticus 26:22 I will send wild animals among you, which will devour your children and your livestock and reduce your numbers until your land is desolate, and your roads become deserted.
Leviticus 26:23 If even after this you are unwilling to be corrected, but continue to walk in hostility toward me:
Leviticus 26:24 then I will also walk in hostility toward you, and I will strike you seven times more for your sins.
Leviticus 26:25 I will bring an avenging sword upon you to punish you for breaking my covenant. And when you gather yourselves in your cities for protection, I will send pestilence among you, and you will be delivered to your enemies.
Leviticus 26:26 When I break your supply of bread, so that ten men will bake their bread in one oven and will ration it out by weight, you will eat, but you will not be satisfied.
Leviticus 26:27 But if, even after all this, you still will not listen to me, but continue to resist me:
Leviticus 26:28 then I, in turn, will oppose you in wrath, and I will strike you seven times more for your sins.
Leviticus 26:29 so that you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters.
Leviticus 26:30 I will destroy your high places and break your idol images. I will cast your corpses upon the corpses of your idols, and my soul will detest you.
Leviticus 26:31 I will reduce your cities to ruins and your sanctuaries will be laid waste, and I will no longer accept the sweet aroma of your sacrifices.
Leviticus 26:32 I will lay waste your land, and your enemies who settle there will be astonished at its desolation.
Leviticus 26:33 And I will scatter you among the nations, and I will pursue you with a drawn sword. Your land will be desolate, and your cities ruined.
Leviticus 26:34 Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths throughout all the days of your desolation, when you are in an enemy land. It will rest and make up for all the Sabbaths you failed to give it.
Leviticus 26:35 because it did not rest on your Sabbaths when you dwelt in it.
Leviticus 26:36 As for those of you who survive, I will put a dread into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a rustling leaf will chase them. They will flee as though from a sword, and they will fall even when no one is pursuing them.
Leviticus 26:37 And they will stumble over one another, as if fleeing from battle, even when no one is pursuing them. You will not be able to stand against your enemies.
Leviticus 26:38 You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you.
Leviticus 26:39 And those of you who are left will waste away because of their sins in the lands of their enemies; they will pine away both for their own sins and for the sins of their fathers.
Leviticus 26:40 This will continue until they confess their iniquities and the iniquities of their ancestors, by which they transgressed against me and continued in hostility toward me.
Leviticus 27:1 And the Lord God spoke to Moses, saying to him:
Leviticus 27:2 “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them this: If a person makes a vow, dedicating their own life to the Lord God, they must live according to the assigned value of their vow.
Leviticus 27:3 If the person is a male, from twenty years old up to sixty years old, his assigned value will be fifty shekels of silver, weighed by the standard of the sanctuary.
Leviticus 27:4 If the person is a female, her assigned value will be thirty shekels.
Leviticus 27:5 If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, a male’s assigned value will be twenty shekels, and a female’s assigned value will be ten shekels.
Leviticus 27:6 If the person is from one month old up to five years old, for a male, five shekels of silver will be his assigned value; for a female, three shekels will be her assigned value.
Leviticus 27:7 If the person is sixty years old or older, a male’s assigned value will be fifteen shekels, and a female’s assigned value will be ten shekels.
Leviticus 27:8 But if the person is poor and cannot afford the assigned value, he must stand before the priest. The priest will then assess how much the person can afford to pay, and that is what he will give.
Leviticus 27:9 If the vow concerns an animal that can be offered to the Lord God, whatever animal of that kind enters the sanctuary will be consecrated.
Leviticus 27:10 The consecrated animal cannot be exchanged or altered, neither a good one for a bad one, nor a bad one for a good one. If anyone tries to exchange an animal, both the exchanged animal and the original animal will become consecrated.
Leviticus 27:11 If the vow concerns an unclean animal, one that cannot be offered to the Lord God, it must be presented before the priest.
Leviticus 27:12 The priest will judge whether the animal is good or bad and will set its value. Whatever value the priest sets, that will be its final price.
Leviticus 27:13 But if the person who made the vow wishes to buy back the animal, they must add one-fifth to its assigned value.
Leviticus 27:14 If a person makes a vow concerning their house, consecrating it to the Lord God, the priest will inspect it to determine if it is good or bad. Its value will stand according to the price the priest sets.
Leviticus 27:15 But if the person who made the vow wishes to buy back their house, they must add one-fifth of the estimated money, and then they will possess it again.
Leviticus 27:16 If a person makes a vow concerning their inherited field and consecrates it to the Lord God, its value will be assessed according to the amount of seed required to plant it. A field requiring thirty measures of barley will be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
Leviticus 27:17 If the person dedicates the field immediately after the Year of Jubilee, it will stand at its full assessed value.
Leviticus 27:18 But if the field is dedicated a few years after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate the money according to the number of years remaining until the next Jubilee, and the full price will be reduced by that amount.
Leviticus 27:19 If the person who made the vow wishes to buy back their field, they must add one-fifth of the estimated money, and then they will possess it.
Leviticus 27:20 But if the person does not wish to buy it back and instead sells the field to someone else, it can no longer be redeemed by the original owner.
Leviticus 27:21 For when the field is set free in the Jubilee year, without any redemption, it will belong to the priests, as consecrated property belonging to the Lord God.
Leviticus 27:22 If a person consecrates to the Lord God a field that they have bought, which is not part of their ancestral inheritance,
Leviticus 27:23 the priest will calculate the value of its price according to the number of years remaining until the Jubilee. The person making the vow must then immediately give the Lord God the value of the offering.
Leviticus 27:24 In the Jubilee year, however, the field will return to its former owner, who had sold it and owned it as part of his inheritance.
Leviticus 27:25 All valuations must be weighed by the standard of the sanctuary shekel. One shekel has twenty gerahs—which is the weight of the obol.
Leviticus 27:26 Also, no one can consecrate the firstborn animals, for they already belong to the Lord God. Whether it is an ox or a sheep, they are already the Lord God’s.
Leviticus 27:27 But if the firstborn animal is unclean, it must be bought back according to its assigned value, and one-fifth of the price will be added. If it is not bought back, it will be sold to another person according to its assigned value.
Leviticus 27:28 Anything that a person dedicates to the Lord God as a thing irrevocably devoted—whether it is a person, an animal, or a field that is their inherited property—it cannot be sold or bought back. Whatever is once irrevocably devoted will be most holy to the Lord God.
Leviticus 27:29 Every human soul and person who is irrevocably devoted will not be bought back, but must be put to death.
Leviticus 27:30 All tithes of the land, whether from the produce of the soil or from the fruit of the trees, belong to the Lord God and are consecrated to Him.
Leviticus 27:31 If anyone wishes to buy back any part of their tithes, they must add one-fifth to its assigned value.
Leviticus 27:32 Regarding all tithes of cattle, sheep, and goats, whatever passes under the shepherd’s staff as the tenth animal will be consecrated to the Lord God.
Leviticus 27:33 The tenth animal will not be examined to see if it is good or bad, nor can it be exchanged for another. If anyone exchanges it, both the exchanged animal and the original animal will become consecrated, and neither will return to the original owner.”
Leviticus 27:34 These are the commandments that the Lord God gave to Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.
Numbers 1:1 The Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, inside the tabernacle of the covenant. This happened on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had left the land of Egypt. The Lord said:
Numbers 1:2 "Take a census of the entire assembly of the children of Israel, organizing them by their lineages, households, and families. Count all the males, one by one, by their individual names.
Numbers 1:3 Count all those who are twenty years old and older—everyone in Israel who is capable of going out to war. You and Aaron are to count them by their divisions.
Numbers 1:4 And with you there will be a leader from each tribe, representing their own households and families."
Numbers 1:5 These are the names of the men: From the tribe of Reuben, Elizur the son of Sedeur.
Numbers 1:6 From the tribe of Simeon, Salamiel the son of Surishaddai.
Numbers 1:7 From the tribe of Gad, Eliasaph the son of Duel.
Numbers 1:8 From the tribe of Judah, Nahashon the son of Aminadab.

Numbers 1:14 From the tribe of Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
Numbers 1:15 From the tribe of Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran.
Numbers 1:16 From the tribe of Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.
Numbers 1:17 These men are the most esteemed of the assembly, the leaders of their tribes and families, the heads of the army of Israel.
Numbers 1:18 Moses and Aaron took these leaders, and then they assembled the entire multitude of Israel. They counted them by their families, lineages, and households, recording the names of each individual, all those who were twenty years old and older,
Numbers 1:19 just as the Lord had commanded them to do. This census took place in the desert of Sinai.
Numbers 1:20 From the tribe of Reuben, Israel's firstborn son, the count was taken. They were enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each head. All the males who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,
Numbers 1:21 numbered forty-six thousand five hundred.
Numbers 1:22 From the sons of Simeon, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each head. All the males who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,
Numbers 1:23 numbered fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
Numbers 1:24 From the sons of Gad, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,
Numbers 1:25 numbered forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty.
Numbers 1:26 From the sons of Judah, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,

Numbers 1:29 numbered fifty-four thousand five hundred.
Numbers 1:30 From the sons of Zebulon, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,
Numbers 1:31 numbered fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
Numbers 1:32 From the sons of Joseph—specifically from the sons of Ephraim—enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,
Numbers 1:33 numbered forty thousand five hundred.
Numbers 1:34 From the sons of Manasseh, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,
Numbers 1:35 numbered thirty-two thousand two hundred.
Numbers 1:36 From the sons of Benjamin, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,
Numbers 1:37 numbered thirty-five thousand four hundred.
Numbers 1:38 From the sons of Dan, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,
Numbers 1:39 numbered sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
Numbers 1:40 From the sons of Asher, enumerated by their lineages and families, by their ancestral households, and by the names of each individual. All those who were twenty years old and older, capable of going out to war,
Numbers 2:1 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, giving them instructions:
Numbers 2:2 The sons of Israel are to set up their tents, each man in his own camp, divided by their regiments and under their own tribal banners. These camps are to be arranged all around the tabernacle of the covenant, facing it.
Numbers 2:3 On the eastern side, towards the sunrise, the tribe of Judah shall pitch their camp, organized by their own divisions. The leader of the sons of Judah will be Nahshon, the son of Amminadab.
Numbers 2:4 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was seventy-four thousand six hundred.
Numbers 2:5 Immediately next to them, the tribe of Issachar shall pitch their tents. Their leader is Nathanael, the son of Zuar.
Numbers 2:6 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was fifty-four thousand four hundred.
Numbers 2:7 Next to these camps will be the tribe of Zebulun. Their leader is Eliab, the son of Helon.
Numbers 2:8 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
Numbers 2:9 The total number counted in the camp of Judah—which includes Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun—was one hundred eighty-six thousand four hundred fighting men, all organized by their divisions. These are the first groups that will set out when the camp moves.
Numbers 2:10 To the south, the camp of the sons of Reuben will be stationed. Their leader is Elizur, the son of Shedeur.
Numbers 2:11 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was forty-six thousand five hundred.
Numbers 2:12 Immediately next to them, the tribe of Simeon shall pitch their tents. Their leader is Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers 2:13 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
Numbers 2:14 Next to these camps will be the tribe of Gad. Their leader is Eliasaph, the son of Deuel.
Numbers 2:15 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.
Numbers 2:16 The total number counted in the camp of Reuben—which includes Reuben, Simeon, and Gad—was one hundred fifty-one thousand four hundred fifty fighting men, all organized by their divisions. These are the second groups that will set out when the camp moves.
Numbers 2:17 Then the tabernacle of the covenant will move, along with the camp of the Levites, who are responsible for it. The Levites' camp will be positioned in the very center of all the other tribes' camps. Just as they carefully set up their camps, so too they will carefully take them down, each individual following their specific place and designated order.
Numbers 2:18 To the west, the camp of Ephraim will be stationed. Their leader is Elishama, the son of Ammihud.
Numbers 2:19 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was forty thousand five hundred.
Numbers 2:20 Immediately next to them, the tribe of Manasseh shall pitch their tents. Their leader is Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur.
Numbers 2:21 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was thirty-two thousand two hundred.
Numbers 2:22 Next to these camps will be the tribe of Benjamin. Their leader is Abidan, the son of Gideon.
Numbers 2:23 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was thirty-five thousand four hundred.
Numbers 2:24 The total number counted in the camp of Ephraim—which includes Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin—was one hundred eight thousand one hundred fighting men, all organized by their divisions. These are the third groups that will set out when the camp moves.
Numbers 2:25 To the north, the camp of Dan will be stationed. Their leader is Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai.
Numbers 2:26 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
Numbers 2:27 Immediately next to them, the tribe of Asher shall pitch their tents. Their leader is Pagiel, the son of Ocran.
Numbers 2:28 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was forty-one thousand five hundred.
Numbers 2:29 Next to these camps will be the tribe of Naphtali. Their leader is Ahira, the son of Enan.
Numbers 2:30 The total count of all the fighting men from his tribe was fifty-three thousand four hundred.
Numbers 2:31 The total number counted in the camp of Dan—which includes Dan, Asher, and Naphtali—was one hundred fifty-seven thousand six hundred fighting men, all organized by their divisions. These are the last groups that will set out when the camp moves.
Numbers 2:32 This is the grand total of the sons of Israel who were numbered and organized by their armies: six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty fighting men.
Numbers 2:33 However, the Levites were not counted among the fighting men of the sons of Israel, just as the Lord had commanded.
Numbers 2:34 Therefore, the sons of Israel did everything exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses. This is how they pitched their tents for camp, and this is how they marched out, each group organized by their divisions, families, and households.
Numbers 3:1 These are the priestly lineages of Aaron, and these are the descendants of Moses. These records begin from the day the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.
Numbers 3:2 These are the names of Aaron’s sons: Nadab, his firstborn, then Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
Numbers 3:3 These are the names of Aaron’s sons, who were consecrated as priests. Their hands were formally initiated for the sacred office, so they could carry out the duties of the priesthood.
Numbers 3:4 Nadab and Abihu, however, died when they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord in the desert of Sinai. They died without leaving any children. Therefore, Eleazar and Ithamar carried out the priestly duties in the presence of their father, Aaron.
Numbers 3:5 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 3:6 Bring forward the tribe of Levi. Place them before Aaron the priest, so they can assist him and attend to the duties that pertain to worship.
Numbers 3:7 They must also guard the sacred vessels of the Tabernacle of the Testimony and everything pertaining to the ceremonies, to serve the children of Israel.
Numbers 3:8 They will be responsible for all the duties related to the worship in the Tabernacle, and for the service of the children of Israel.
Numbers 3:9 You are to assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons, so they can assist them in their service.
Numbers 3:10 But Aaron and his sons, you shall appoint them to oversee all the sacred duties of the priesthood. Any outsider who approaches to perform these duties will be put to death.
Numbers 3:11 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 3:12 Behold, I have chosen the Levites from among the children of Israel, in place of every firstborn male who opens the womb among the children of Israel. So the Levites shall be considered mine.
Numbers 3:13 For every firstborn belongs to me. From the day I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for myself everything firstborn in Israel, from man to beast. They are mine. I am the Lord.
Numbers 3:14 And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, saying:
Numbers 3:15 Count the sons of Levi according to their ancestral households and families. Count every male from one month old and upward.
Numbers 3:16 So Moses counted the sons of Levi, just as he had been commanded.
Numbers 3:17 These were the sons of Levi, by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
Numbers 3:18 The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei.
Numbers 3:19 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
Numbers 3:20 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of Levi according to their households and families.
Numbers 3:21 From Gershon came the clans of Libni and Shimei; these are the families of the Gershonites.
Numbers 3:22 Those counted among the males, from one month old and upward, numbered seven thousand five hundred.
Numbers 3:23 These Gershonites would pitch their tents behind the Tabernacle, to the west.
Numbers 3:24 The chief of the Gershonite households was Eliasaph, son of Lael.
Numbers 3:25 Their responsibilities included guarding the Tabernacle of the Covenant, its covering, and the curtains that are at the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
Numbers 3:26 Also, the curtains of the courtyard, and the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard of the Tabernacle, all that pertains to the altar, the ropes of the Tabernacle, and all the vessels of its furnishings.
Numbers 3:27 From Kohath came the clans of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites. These are the Kohathite families according to their clans.
Numbers 3:28 All the males counted, from one month old and upward, numbered eight thousand six hundred. Their specific duty was the care of the sanctuary.
Numbers 3:29 The sons of Kohath would pitch their tents on the south side of the Tabernacle.
Numbers 3:30 The chief of the Kohathite households was Elizaphan, son of Uzziel.
Numbers 3:31 Under their care were the Ark, the table of showbread, the lampstand, the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary used for ministry, and the veil (separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies).
Numbers 3:32 And the chief of all the Levitical chiefs was Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest. He had oversight over those who were responsible for the sanctuary’s care.
Numbers 3:33 From Merari came the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites. These are the Merarite families according to their clans.
Numbers 3:34 Those counted among the males, from one month old and upward, numbered six thousand two hundred.
Numbers 3:35 The chief of the Merarite households was Zuriel, son of Abihail. These would pitch their tents to the north of the Tabernacle.
Numbers 3:36 Under their care were the frames of the Tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its bases, and all its associated vessels and furnishings.
Numbers 3:37 Also the pillars of the courtyard all around with their bases, their tent pegs, and their ropes.
Numbers 3:38 Moses and Aaron, and the males from the priestly lineage of Kohath (Aaron’s sons), made their camp before the Tabernacle, that is, to the east. They guarded the sacred ceremonies of the sanctuary on behalf of the children of Israel.
Numbers 3:39 All the Levite males, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the word of the Lord, by their families, from one month old and upward, numbered twenty-two thousand.
Numbers 3:40 And the Lord said to Moses: 'Count all the firstborn males among the children of Israel, from one month old and upward, and you will have the total number of them.'
Numbers 4:2 Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the Levites, according to their families and their ancestral houses,
Numbers 4:3 Count all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, who are qualified to enter and perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
Numbers 4:4 This, then, is the sacred duty of the sons of Kohath regarding the Tabernacle of the Covenant: the Holy of Holies.
Numbers 4:5 Aaron and his sons shall enter when the camp is to move. They will take down the veil that is before the entrance, and with it, they will cover the Ark of the Testimony.
Numbers 4:6 On top of the Ark, they will place a covering of blue material, and then they will put the carrying poles through its rings.
Numbers 4:7 They will also cover the table of the showbread—and its items, and its offerings, and its cups, and its bowls for pouring libations—with a blue cloth.
Numbers 4:8 And over that, they will spread a scarlet covering, which they will then cover with a protective covering of blue skins. Then they will insert its carrying poles.
Numbers 4:9 They will also take the lampstand for the lights, along with its lamps, its snuffers, its trays for wicks, and all its oil vessels, which pertain to its sacred service.
Numbers 4:10 They will wrap all these items together in a blue covering and place them on a cart.
Numbers 4:11 The golden altar, and the garment with which it is covered during divine service, and the anointing oil, and the incense of composition, and all the vessels that pertain to its ritual,
Numbers 4:12 they will wrap in blue coverings and place on the cart.
Numbers 4:13 They will remove the ashes from the altar and then cover it with a purple garment.
Numbers 4:14 And they will place over it all the items used in its service: specifically, the fire pans, the meat forks, the three-pronged hooks, the shovels, and the fire baskets. They will cover all the altar's vessels together with a protective covering of blue skins, and then they will insert the carrying poles.
Numbers 4:15 Once Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all its items, as the camp journeys are completed, then the sons of Kohath will enter to carry them. However, they must not touch the items of the sanctuary directly, lest they die. These are the burdens of the sons of Kohath regarding the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
Numbers 4:16 The duty of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, includes the care of the oil for the lamps, and the incense of composition, and the perpetual sacrifice, and the anointing oil. He is responsible for all things within the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the sanctuary.
Numbers 4:17 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Numbers 4:18 Do not allow the multitude of the clan of Kohath to perish from among the Levites.
Numbers 4:19 Instead, do this for them, so that they may live and not die when they approach the Holy of Holies. Let Aaron and his sons go in and assign each one to his specific sacred service and to his various burdens.
Numbers 4:20 They must not enter to see the sacred things that are properly arranged in the sanctuary, lest they die.
Numbers 4:21 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 4:22 Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, according to their ancestral houses and their families.
Numbers 4:23 Count all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, who are qualified to enter and perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
Numbers 4:24 This is the duty of the families of the Gershonites: to carry and guard the following:
Numbers 4:25 the curtains of the Tabernacle, and the Tabernacle of the Covenant itself, the covering for it, and the outer blue protective covering which is placed on top of it,
Numbers 4:26 and the hangings for the courtyard, and the curtain for its entrance, and the ropes all around, and whatever pertains to its use and sacred service.
Numbers 4:27 According to the command of Aaron and his sons, the sons of Gershon shall carry and perform sacred service in all these matters. They are not permitted to carry any burden that has not been commanded.
Numbers 4:28 This is the duty of the families of the Gershonites in the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and their chief is Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers 4:29 You shall also enumerate the sons of Merari according to their families and their ancestral houses.
Numbers 4:30 Count all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, all who are qualified to enter and perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
Numbers 4:31 These are their burdens: the boards of the Tabernacle, and its carrying bars, and its pillars with their bases,
Numbers 4:32 and the pillars of the courtyard all around with their bases, and the pegs, and the ropes. All these vessels and utensils shall be delivered by name—meaning, each item will be specifically assigned for carrying.
Numbers 4:33 This is the duty of the families of the Merarites and their sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant. Their chief is Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers 4:34 So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the assembly took a census of the sons of Kohath, according to their families and their ancestral houses,
Numbers 4:35 counting all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, who are qualified to enter into the sacred service of the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
Numbers 4:36 And those found by number, according to their families, were two thousand seven hundred fifty.
Numbers 4:37 This is the number of the families of the Kohathites, all who perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant, whom Moses and Aaron enumerated according to the command of the Lord through Moses.
Numbers 4:38 The sons of Gershon were also enumerated according to their families and their ancestral houses,
Numbers 4:39 counting all those from thirty years old and above, up to fifty years old, all who are qualified to enter and perform sacred service in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
Numbers 4:40 And those found by number, according to their families and their ancestral houses, were two thousand six hundred thirty.
Numbers 5:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 5:2 “Command the children of Israel to remove from their camp everyone who has a serious skin disease, everyone who has an uncontrolled discharge of fluids, and everyone who has become ritually defiled by touching a dead body.”
Numbers 5:3 “You must remove both men and women from the camp. This is so they will not ritually defile their camp, since I Myself dwell among them.”
Numbers 5:4 The children of Israel did exactly this; they expelled those people from the camp, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers 5:5 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 5:6 “Speak to the children of Israel: When a man or a woman commits any of the sins that people commonly commit, and thereby acts unfaithfully against the Lord, that person is guilty.
Numbers 5:7 They must confess the sin they committed. They must repay in full what they took through their wrongdoing, adding a fifth part (20%) to it, and give it to the person they wronged.”
Numbers 5:8 “But if there is no close relative to receive the repayment, then the payment that is owed must be given to the Lord, and it will belong to the priest, in addition to the ram of atonement offered for that specific offense.”
Numbers 5:9 “Every contribution of sacred offerings that the children of Israel bring to the priest will belong to him.
Numbers 5:10 And whatever anyone offers, it will be for the priest. Indeed, if anyone gives something to the priest, all of it will belong to him.”
Numbers 5:11 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 5:12 “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: If a man’s wife has gone away from him and been intimate with another man,
Numbers 5:13 and her husband cannot know about it because the adultery was kept secret and hidden, and there is no witness, and she has not been caught in the act:
Numbers 5:14 but a spirit of jealousy and contention comes upon the husband, and he suspects his wife, whether she has actually been defiled or not:
Numbers 5:15 then the man must bring his wife to the priest, and he must bring an offering for her: a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He must not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it, because it is an offering of jealousy, and an offering for a transgression, intended to bring the adultery to light.”
Numbers 5:16 “So the priest will take her and present her before the Lord.
Numbers 5:17 The priest will take holy water in an earthenware vessel and put a little dust from the floor of the tabernacle into it.”
Numbers 5:18 “When the priest has presented the woman before the Lord, he will uncover her head and place the offering of remembrance — the offering of jealousy — upon her hands. The priest himself will hold in his hand the bitter waters, which bring a curse.
Numbers 5:19 Then the priest will make her swear an oath and say to her: ‘If no other man has been intimate with you, and if you have not been defiled by leaving your husband, then you will be innocent from these bitter waters and the curse they carry.’”
Numbers 5:20 “‘But if you have turned away from your husband and been defiled, and you have been intimate with another man:’
Numbers 5:21 ‘then you will be subject to this curse: May the Lord make you an object of execration and an example among all your people; may He cause your thigh to waste away and your belly to swell.’
Numbers 5:22 ‘May your belly swell up with a tumor and your thigh rot away.’ And the woman must say, ‘Amen, amen.’
Numbers 5:23 “Then the priest will write these curses in a scroll, and he will wash them into the bitter waters.
Numbers 5:24 And he will give the woman the bitter waters to drink. When she has drunk them, if she is defiled and has been caught in adultery, having scorned her husband: then her belly will swell up, and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become an object of execration among her people.”
Numbers 5:25 “But if she has not been defiled, she will be unharmed and will be able to bear children.”
Numbers 5:26 “This is the law concerning jealousy: if a woman turns away from her husband and becomes defiled, and her husband, moved by a spirit of jealousy, brings her before the Lord;
Numbers 5:27 —even if she drinks the bitter waters that carry the curse—if the woman is not actually defiled, she will remain unharmed by these bitter waters and their curse.
Numbers 5:28 But if she has been defiled and caught in adultery, her belly will swell up with a tumor, and her thigh will waste away, and the woman will become an object of execration among her people.
Numbers 5:29 This is the law of jealousy, which applies to a husband if he is stirred by a spirit of jealousy against his wife,
Numbers 5:30 or if a woman turns away from her husband and becomes defiled.
Numbers 5:31 Then the man will present his wife to the priest, and she will immediately drink the waters of the curse, and if she is innocent, she will not be found guilty of the sin.”
Numbers 6:1 Then the Lord God spoke to Moses and said:
Numbers 6:2 “Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: If any man or woman makes a special vow to dedicate themselves to the Lord through a Nazirite vow,
Numbers 6:3 they must completely separate themselves from wine and strong drink. They must not drink vinegar made from wine or from strong drink. They must not drink any juice pressed from grapes, and they must not eat fresh grapes or dried grapes. This is a total abstinence from anything made from the vine.
Numbers 6:4 For the entire duration of their Nazirite consecration to the Lord, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, from the seeds to the skin.
Numbers 6:5 During the entire time of their vow, no razor is to touch their head. They are to remain holy by growing out the hair of their head, until the days of their dedication to the Lord are completed.
Numbers 6:6 For the entire period of their consecration, they must not go near a dead body.
Numbers 6:7 They must not make themselves unclean, even if their father, mother, brother, or sister dies. This is because the mark of their God’s consecration is upon their head, making them especially sacred.
Numbers 6:8 Throughout the entire time of their separation for the Lord, they are to be holy to the Lord God.
Numbers 6:9 If someone unexpectedly and accidentally dies next to them, the consecrated head of the Nazirite becomes defiled. On the day of their purification, they must shave their head.
Numbers 6:10 On the eighth day, they must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
Numbers 6:11 The priest will then offer one bird as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a burnt offering. The priest will make atonement for them, for the sin they committed by being near the dead person, and on that day, the priest will reconsecrate their head.
Numbers 6:12 They must then rededicate their days of separation to the Lord and offer a male lamb in its first year as a sin offering. All the previous days of their vow are invalidated, because their consecration was defiled.
Numbers 6:13 “This is the law for the Nazirite: When the days of their consecration are completed, they must be brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,
Numbers 6:14 and they must offer their sacrifices to the Lord: a male lamb in its first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; a female lamb in its first year, without blemish, for a sin offering; and one ram, without blemish, for a peace offering.
Numbers 6:15 Also, a basket of unleavened bread made with fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, along with their grain offerings and drink offerings.
Numbers 6:16 The priest will present these offerings before the Lord, performing the sin offering and the burnt offering first.
Numbers 6:17 The priest will then sacrifice the ram as a peace offering to the Lord, along with the basket of unleavened bread, and its accompanying grain offerings and drink offerings as is customary.
Numbers 6:18 Then the Nazirite will shave off the hair of their consecrated head at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. They will take the shaved hair, which is a sign of their consecration, and put it on the fire that is under the peace offering.
Numbers 6:19 The priest will take a boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and place them on the hands of the Nazirite after their head has been shaved.
Numbers 6:20 The priest will wave these offerings before the Lord; they are a holy portion for the priest, just like the consecrated breast and the separated thigh are. After this ritual, the Nazirite is permitted to drink wine again.
Numbers 6:21 “This is the law for the Nazirite concerning their vow and their offerings to the Lord, including the hair of their head. This is what they must offer, beyond what their means allow. According to the vow they have thoughtfully made, so they must carry out their consecration.”
Numbers 6:22 Then the Lord God spoke to Moses and said:
Numbers 6:23 “Speak to Aaron and his sons, instructing them on how to bless the children of Israel. Say to them:
Numbers 6:24 May the Lord God bless you and keep watch over you.
Numbers 6:25 May the Lord God make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
Numbers 6:26 May the Lord God lift up His countenance upon you and give you true peace.
Numbers 6:27 This is how they will invoke My name over the children of Israel, and I, the Lord God, will personally bless them.”
Numbers 6:28 Then the Lord God spoke to Moses after He had finished all His commands, saying:
Numbers 6:29 “This is the offering of the leaders of Israel on the day the altar was dedicated and anointed for its sacred purpose. They brought twelve carts, twelve oxen—one ox for each cart, and one ox for each leader.
Numbers 6:30 And they presented these offerings before the Lord God.
Numbers 6:31 Then the Lord God said to Moses: 'Accept these from them, and they are to be used for the service of the Tent of Meeting. You are to give them to the Levites, according to each one’s specific service.'
Numbers 6:32 So Moses received the carts and the oxen, and he gave them to the Levites.
Numbers 6:33 He gave two carts and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, for their specific duties.
Numbers 6:34 He gave four carts and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, for their specific duties.
Numbers 6:35 But to the sons of Kohath he gave no carts or oxen, because their duty was to carry the holy things of the sanctuary on their shoulders, without any vehicles.
Numbers 6:36 Therefore, the leaders brought these offerings for the dedication of the altar on the very day it was anointed.
Numbers 6:37 On the first day, Nahshon, son of Amminadab, the leader of the tribe of Judah, presented his offering.
Numbers 6:38 His offering consisted of: one silver plate weighing one hundred and thirty shekels, and one silver basin weighing seventy shekels, according to the holy sanctuary standard. Both were filled with fine flour mixed with oil, as a grain offering.
Numbers 6:39 Also, one small gold pan, weighing ten shekels, full of incense.
Numbers 6:40 And for a burnt offering: one young bull from the herd, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year.
Numbers 7:1 It came to pass on the very day when Moses completed the Tabernacle, and set it up, and consecrated it with oil, and made all its sacred vessels holy by anointing them,
Numbers 7:2 the tribal leaders of Israel, who were the heads of their ancestral houses and in charge of the numbered men, brought their offerings.
Numbers 7:3 Their offerings before the Lord were six covered wagons and twelve oxen. Two of the tribal leaders offered one wagon, and each leader offered one ox, and they handed them over to the Levites, with each Levite family receiving a portion.
Numbers 7:4 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 7:5  'Receive these offerings from them, because they will be used for the service of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. You shall give them to the Levites, to each group according to their specific duty.' 
Numbers 7:6 So Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and he handed them over to the Levites.
Numbers 7:7 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to the requirements of their service.
Numbers 7:8 And he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to the requirements of their service, under the direct supervision of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
Numbers 7:9 But to the sons of Kohath, he gave no wagons or oxen; for it was their duty to carry the most holy objects of the Tabernacle on their shoulders.
Numbers 7:10 Therefore, the tribal leaders brought their offerings for the dedication of the altar on the very day it was consecrated.
Numbers 7:11 And the Lord said to Moses, 'Each tribal leader shall bring his dedication offering for the altar on a separate day.' 
Numbers 7:12 So, on the first day, Nahshon, the son of Amminadab from the tribe of Judah, brought his offering.
Numbers 7:13 His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.
Numbers 7:14 Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.
Numbers 7:15 And a male goat for the sin offering.
Numbers 7:16 Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Nahshon, the son of Amminadab.
Numbers 7:17 On the second day, Nathanael, the son of Zuar from the tribe of Issachar, brought his offering.
Numbers 7:18 His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.
Numbers 7:19 Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.
Numbers 7:20 And a male goat for the sin offering.
Numbers 7:21 Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Nathanael, the son of Zuar.
Numbers 7:22 On the third day, Eliab, the son of Helon and leader of the sons of Zebulun, brought his offering.
Numbers 7:23 His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.
Numbers 7:24 Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.
Numbers 7:25 And a male goat for the sin offering.
Numbers 7:26 Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Eliab, the son of Helon.
Numbers 7:27 On the fourth day, Elizur, the son of Shedeur and leader of the sons of Reuben, brought his offering.
Numbers 7:28 His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.
Numbers 7:29 Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.
Numbers 7:30 And a male goat for the sin offering.
Numbers 7:31 Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Elizur, the son of Shedeur.
Numbers 7:32 On the fifth day, Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai and leader of the sons of Simeon, brought his offering.
Numbers 7:33 His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.
Numbers 7:34 Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense.
Numbers 7:35 And a male goat for the sin offering.
Numbers 7:36 Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai.
Numbers 7:37 On the sixth day, Eliasaph, the son of Deuel and leader of the sons of Gad, brought his offering.
Numbers 7:38 His offering consisted of: a silver dish weighing one hundred and thirty shekels (measured by the sanctuary standard), and a silver bowl weighing seventy shekels, according to the same sanctuary standard. Both vessels were filled with fine flour mixed with oil for the grain offering, along with frankincense.
Numbers 7:39 Also, a golden spoon weighing ten shekels, filled with frankincense; and a male goat for the sin offering.
Numbers 7:40 Two oxen, one ram, and five one-year-old male lambs for the peace offering. This was the entire offering from Eliasaph, the son of Deuel.
Numbers 8:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him these instructions:
Numbers 8:2 “Tell Aaron these instructions: When you prepare the lamps in the Tabernacle, make sure that the light from the seven lamps shines forward, illuminating the area directly in front of the lampstand.”
Numbers 8:3 Aaron carried out these instructions. He lit the lamps on the lampstand so that they faced forward and illuminated the area in front of it, exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers 8:4 This is how the lampstand was made: it was hammered out of pure gold, both its base and its branches, all of it with intricate carved work. The lampstand was crafted exactly according to the design that the Lord had shown to Moses.
Numbers 8:5 The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him further instructions:
Numbers 8:6 “Take the Levites from among all the people of Israel and purify them through a ritual cleansing.
Numbers 8:7 You shall purify them according to this ritual: sprinkle the water of purification upon them. They must shave off all the hair on their bodies; then they are to wash their clothes and cleanse themselves completely.
Numbers 8:8 After this, they are to bring a young bull from the herd, along with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil. You are also to take another young bull as a sin offering for them.
Numbers 8:9 You are to bring the Levites before the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and then you are to assemble the entire community of the people of Israel.
Numbers 8:10 When you present the Levites before the Lord, all the people of Israel shall lay their hands upon them, dedicating them.
Numbers 8:11 Aaron shall then present the Levites before the Lord as a special wave offering from the people of Israel, so that the Levites may perform their service for Me in the Tabernacle.
Numbers 8:12 The Levites, in turn, are to lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls. One bull is to be offered as a sin offering, and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for the Levites.
Numbers 8:13 You are to present the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and then you will consecrate them as a special offering to the Lord.
Numbers 8:14 Thus, you will separate the Levites from among the rest of the people of Israel, so that the Levites will be exclusively Mine.
Numbers 8:15 After these rituals, the Levites may enter the Tabernacle of the Testimony to serve Me. You are to purify and consecrate them in this manner as a special offering to the Lord, because they have been given to Me as a unique possession from among the people of Israel.
Numbers 8:16 I have accepted them as a replacement for all the firstborn among the people of Israel, for every first male child that opens the womb.
Numbers 8:17 For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are Mine, both of humans and animals. From the day I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I set them apart as holy for Myself.
Numbers 8:18 And now, I have taken the Levites as substitutes for all the firstborn of the people of Israel.
Numbers 8:19 I have given the Levites to Aaron and his sons as a special gift, so that they may perform service for Me on behalf of the people of Israel in the Tabernacle of the Covenant. They are also to make atonement and pray for the people, so that no plague may strike the community if any Israelite should presumptuously approach the Sanctuary without authorization.”
Numbers 8:20 So Moses and Aaron, and the entire community of the people of Israel, performed all these instructions concerning the Levites, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers 8:21 The Levites underwent purification and washed their clothes. Aaron then presented them before the Lord as an offering, making atonement for them.
Numbers 8:22 After this, the Levites began their service in the Tabernacle of the Testimony before Aaron and his sons, exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites.
Numbers 8:23 The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him further instructions:
Numbers 8:24 “This is the law for the Levites: from twenty-five years of age and older, they shall begin their service and perform duties in the Tabernacle of the Covenant.
Numbers 8:25 But when they reach fifty years of age, they shall no longer serve actively, and they will cease from their regular work.
Numbers 8:26 However, they may assist their younger brothers in the Tabernacle of the Testimony, helping to guard what has been entrusted to them. They shall only perform duties of oversight, but they are not to perform the active service of the Tabernacle itself. This is how you are to regulate the Levites concerning their assigned duties and responsibilities.”
Numbers 8:27 The Lord then spoke to Moses, giving him instructions:
Numbers 8:28 “Speak to the people of Israel and tell them: When you enter the land where you will dwell, which I am giving to you,
Numbers 8:29 and you present an offering to the Lord—whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice, fulfilling vows or making a voluntary offering, or during your appointed festivals—to create a pleasing aroma to the Lord from cattle or sheep:
Numbers 8:30 Whoever offers a peace offering must also present a grain offering with it. This grain offering must be one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-quarter of a hin of oil.
Numbers 8:31 And for the drink offering, they are to provide wine in the same measure as the oil, one-quarter of a hin.
Numbers 8:32 This applies to each individual sheep, ram, goat, calf, and ox, and all other animals that are offered as sacrifices.
Numbers 8:33 According to the number of sacrificial animals, the same proportion of fine flour and wine for the drink offerings shall be given for each one.
Numbers 8:34 Every native-born Israelite and every foreigner who lives among you shall perform these rituals according to the same law.
Numbers 8:35 There shall be one law for you and for the resident foreigner, and the same ordinances shall apply to all.
Numbers 8:36 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 8:37 “Speak to the people of Israel and tell them: When you enter the land of Canaan, and you eat from the food of that land,
Numbers 8:38 you are to set aside the first portion of your dough as an offering to the Lord.
Numbers 8:39 From the first of your dough, just as you give a portion from your threshing floors, so too shall you give an offering to the Lord.
Numbers 8:40 You are to present this first portion of your dough as an offering to the Lord throughout all your generations.”
Numbers 9:1 The Lord spoke to Moses in the Sinai desert, in the first month of the second year after the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, saying this to him:
Numbers 9:2 “You, the children of Israel, are to keep the Passover at its proper time.
Numbers 9:3 You must do this on the fourteenth day of that same month, following all of its proper ceremonies and legal requirements.”
Numbers 9:4 So Moses commanded the children of Israel to keep the Passover.
Numbers 9:5 They kept it in the Sinai desert on the fourteenth day of the first month, in the evening. The children of Israel did everything exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Numbers 9:6 However, some men were ritually unclean because they had touched a dead body, and so they were not able to keep the Passover on its designated day. These men came to Moses and Aaron,
Numbers 9:7 and they said: “We are unclean because we touched a dead body. Why should we be prevented from offering the Lord’s sacrifice at its proper time, along with the rest of the children of Israel?”
Numbers 9:8 Moses answered them: “Wait here so I can consult the Lord to see what He commands about your situation.”
Numbers 9:9 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 9:10 “Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: If any man among you, or among your descendants, becomes unclean by touching a dead body, or if he is far away on a journey, he may still keep the Passover for the Lord.
Numbers 9:11 He shall keep it in the second month, on the fourteenth day of that month, in the evening. They must eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
Numbers 9:12 They must not leave any of it until morning, nor break any of its bones. They must observe all the ceremonies of the Passover exactly as prescribed.
Numbers 9:13 But if a man is clean and is not on a journey, and still fails to keep the Passover, that person will be cut off from his people. Because he did not offer the Lord’s sacrifice at its proper time, that man will bear the guilt of his sin.
Numbers 9:14 If a resident foreigner or a temporary visitor among you desires to keep the Passover for the Lord, he must do so according to its ceremonies and legal requirements. You shall have the same law for both the resident foreigner and the native-born person.”
Numbers 9:15 Now, on the day the Tabernacle was set up, a cloud covered it. And from evening until morning, there appeared over the Tabernacle something like the appearance of fire.
Numbers 9:16 This is how it remained continuously: by day, the cloud covered it, and by night, it had the appearance of fire.
Numbers 9:17 Whenever the cloud that was over the Tabernacle moved away, then the children of Israel would set out on their journey. And wherever the cloud settled, there they would set up their camp.
Numbers 9:18 At the Lord’s command they would set out, and at His command they would pitch their tents. As long as the cloud remained over the Tabernacle, they stayed in that same place.
Numbers 9:19 If the cloud stayed over it for many days, the children of Israel observed the Lord’s command and did not move on.
Numbers 9:20 If the cloud was over it for only a few days, they remained at the Lord’s command, and at His command they would set out.
Numbers 9:21 If the cloud remained from evening until morning, and then departed in the morning, they would set out. Or if it departed after a day and a night, they would move their camp by following it.
Numbers 9:22 Whether the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle for two days, or a month, or a longer period of time, the children of Israel remained in the same place and did not move on. But as soon as it departed, they would move their camp.
Numbers 9:23 They set up their tents at the Lord’s command and journeyed at His command. They observed the Lord’s commands, just as the Lord had spoken through Moses.
Numbers 10:1 The Lord God then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 10:2 “Make two trumpets for yourself, made of hammered silver. You shall use them to call the community together when it is time for the camp to move.”
Numbers 10:3 “When you sound them, the entire assembly of people will gather before you at the entrance of the tent of the covenant.”
Numbers 10:4 “If only one trumpet makes a sound, then only the leaders—the heads of the thousands of Israel—will come to you.”
Numbers 10:5 “But if you make a long, repeated sound with the trumpets, then those who are camped on the east side will begin to move.”
Numbers 10:6 “At the second sound, made in the same manner, those who are camped on the south side will prepare their camp to move. And the others will do likewise.”
Numbers 10:7 “However, when the people are to be gathered together, the trumpet sound will be a simple call, not a repeated one.”
Numbers 10:8 “And Aaron's sons, who are priests, shall sound the trumpets. This shall be a lasting ordinance for your generations.”
Numbers 10:9 “If you go out to battle in your land against enemies who are fighting against you, you shall sound a strong call with the trumpets. Then the Lord your God will remember you, and you will be delivered from the hands of your enemies.”
Numbers 10:10 “Also, on your days of celebration, and on your feast days, and at the beginning of your months, you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the peace offerings. They will serve as a reminder for you before your God. I am the Lord your God.”
Numbers 10:11 In the second year, on the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle of testimony.
Numbers 10:12 So the sons of Israel began their journeys, group by group, from the desert of Sinai. And the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
Numbers 10:13 The first groups to move their camps did so according to the Lord's command, through Moses.
Numbers 10:14 And so the sons of Judah set out by their divisions. Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, was their prince.
Numbers 10:15 In the tribe of the sons of Issachar, Nethanel, the son of Zuar, was the prince.
Numbers 10:16 In the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, Eliab, the son of Helon, was the prince.
Numbers 10:17 Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the sons of Gershon and Merari carried it.
Numbers 10:18 Next, the sons of Reuben set out by their divisions and their families. Their prince was Elizur, the son of Shedeur.
Numbers 10:19 In the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai, was the prince.
Numbers 10:20 In the tribe of the sons of Gad, Eliasaph, the son of Deuel, was the prince.
Numbers 10:21 And the sons of Kohath also set out, carrying the sanctuary. This was so that by the time they arrived at the designated stopping place, the tabernacle would already be set up.
Numbers 10:22 Then the sons of Ephraim set out by their divisions and their families. Their prince was Elishama, the son of Ammihud.
Numbers 10:23 In the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur, was the prince.
Numbers 10:24 In the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, Abidan, the son of Gideoni, was the prince.
Numbers 10:25 Lastly, those who formed the rear guard for all the camps were the sons of Dan, who set out by their divisions. Their prince was Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai.
Numbers 10:26 In the tribe of the sons of Asher, Pagiel, the son of Ocran, was the prince.
Numbers 10:27 In the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, Ahira, the son of Enan, was the prince.
Numbers 10:28 These were the movements of the sons of Israel, by their divisions, as they set out on their journeys.
Numbers 10:29 Moses then said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, his father-in-law: “We are setting out for the place that the Lord is going to give us. Come with us, and we will do good to you, because the Lord has promised good things to Israel.”
Numbers 10:30 But Hobab replied: “I will not come with you. Instead, I will return to my own land, where I was born.”
Numbers 10:31 But Moses urged him, saying: “Please do not leave us! For you know the places in the desert where we ought to camp, and you can be our guide.”
Numbers 10:32 “And if you come with us, whatever good things the Lord gives to us, we will give to you as well.”
Numbers 10:33 So they set out from the mountain of the Lord, a three-day journey. And the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them for three days, providing and searching out places for them to camp.
Numbers 10:34 “And the cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they traveled.”
Numbers 10:35 And whenever the ark was lifted up to move, Moses would say: “Arise, Lord, and may your enemies be scattered! May those who hate you flee from your presence!”
Numbers 10:36 “And when it was set down, he would say: ‘Return, Lord, to the countless thousands of Israel's army!’”
Numbers 11:1 The people began to complain against the Lord, as if they were lamenting their hardship. When the Lord heard this, He became very angry. A fire then ignited among them, consuming the outskirts of their camp.
Numbers 11:2 So the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to the Lord for them. The fire was then extinguished.
Numbers 11:3 So the name of that place was called "Burning", because the Lord's fire had been kindled against them there.
Numbers 11:4 But the mixed multitude of people who had come up with them were filled with intense cravings. And the children of Israel also wept, saying: "Who will give us meat to eat?"
Numbers 11:5 We remember the fish we used to eat for free in Egypt! We recall the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.
Numbers 11:6 But now our appetites are dry and weak. Our eyes see nothing but this manna.
Numbers 11:7 The manna itself looked like coriander seed, and its appearance was like crystalline dew.
Numbers 11:8 The people would go out to gather it, then grind it in handmills or crush it in mortars. They would cook it in pots and make cakes from it that tasted like bread made with oil.
Numbers 11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp at night, the manna would descend with it.
Numbers 11:10 Moses then heard the people weeping throughout their families, each person at the entrance of their tents. The Lord's fury became intense, and Moses himself was also greatly displeased by their behavior.
Numbers 11:11 And Moses said to the Lord: "Why have You afflicted Your servant? Why have I not found grace in Your sight, that You would lay the burden of all these people upon me?"
Numbers 11:12 Did I conceive all these people? Or did I give birth to them, that You should tell me: 'Carry them in your arms, as a nurse carries a baby, and bring them to the land which You swore to their fathers'?
Numbers 11:13 Where can I get meat to give to all these people? For they are weeping before me, saying: 'Give us meat, so we may eat'.
Numbers 11:14 I cannot bear all this burden of the people by myself, because it is too heavy for me.
Numbers 11:15 If You are going to continue dealing with me like this, I beg You, please kill me now—if I have found favor in Your eyes—so I may not see my own troubles and misery any further.
Numbers 11:16 And the Lord said to Moses: "Gather for Me seventy men from the elders of Israel, men whom you know to be elders and leaders of the people. Bring them to the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and have them stand there with you."
Numbers 11:17 And I will come down and speak with you there. I will take some of the Spirit that is upon you and put it upon them, so that they may bear the burden of the people with you, and you will not be burdened alone.
Numbers 11:18 And to the people you shall say: 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for you shall eat meat. For you have complained, saying: "Who will give us meat to eat? It was better for us in Egypt!" Now, the Lord will give you meat, and you shall eat it'.
Numbers 11:19 You will eat it not for just one day, nor for two, or five, or ten, or even twenty days,
Numbers 11:20 but for an entire month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes sickening to you. This will happen because you have despised the Lord, who is in your midst, and have wept before Him, saying: 'Why did we ever leave Egypt?'
Numbers 11:21 And Moses said: "There are six hundred thousand footmen among these people, among whom I stand. Yet You say: 'I will give them meat to eat for an entire month'?"
Numbers 11:22 Even if flocks of sheep and herds of cattle were slaughtered, would they be enough for their food? Or if all the fish of the sea were gathered together, would they satisfy them?
Numbers 11:23 To which the Lord answered: "Is the Lord's power limited? Now you shall see whether My word will be fulfilled in action or not."
Numbers 11:24 So Moses went out and reported the Lord's words to the people. He gathered seventy men from the elders of Israel and made them stand around the Tabernacle.
Numbers 11:25 And the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to Moses. He took some of the Spirit that was upon Moses and placed it upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease afterward.
Numbers 11:26 Two men, however, had remained in the camp. One was named Eldad and the other Medad, and the Spirit rested upon them, for they had also been listed among the elders, but had not gone out to the Tabernacle. When they prophesied in the camp,
Numbers 11:27 a young man ran and reported to Moses, saying: "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!"
Numbers 11:28 Immediately, Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' assistant and one of his chosen men, said: "My Lord Moses, forbid them!"
Numbers 11:29 To him Moses replied: "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the Lord's people would prophesy, and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them all!"
Numbers 11:30 After this, Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
Numbers 11:31 Then a wind came from the Lord, which swept quails from the sea and brought them to the camp. They were scattered for a distance of a day's journey all around the camp, and lay about two cubits (around three feet) high on the surface of the earth.
Numbers 11:32 So the people rose up all that day, all that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. Even he who gathered the least collected ten homers (about 60 bushels). They then spread them out all around the camp to dry.
Numbers 11:33 While the meat was still between their teeth and had not yet been consumed, the Lord's anger was stirred against the people, and He struck them with an exceedingly great plague.
Numbers 11:34 So the name of that place was called "Graves of Craving", because there they buried the people who had craved meat with such intensity.
Numbers 11:35 From the Graves of Craving, they journeyed to Hazeroth and remained there.
Numbers 12:1 Then Miriam and Aaron began speaking against Moses because of his Ethiopian wife. They asked, 'Why did he marry an Ethiopian woman?'
Numbers 12:2 They continued, 'Has the Lord spoken only through Moses? Has He not also spoken through us?' The Lord heard what they said.
Numbers 12:3 Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the earth.
Numbers 12:4 Immediately the Lord spoke to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, saying, 'Go out, you three, to the Tent of Meeting.' So they went out.
Numbers 12:5 The Lord descended in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. He called Aaron and Miriam. When both of them had come forward,
Numbers 12:6 He said to them, 'Hear My words: If there is a prophet among you who speaks for the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.'
Numbers 12:7 But My servant Moses is not like that, for he is most faithful in all My house.
Numbers 12:8 For I speak to him face to face, and plainly, not through dark sayings and riddles. Moreover, he sees the very form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?
Numbers 12:9 And the Lord was angry with them and departed.
Numbers 12:10 The cloud also departed from above the Tent of Meeting. And behold, Miriam was suddenly white with leprosy like snow. When Aaron looked at her and saw she was completely covered with leprosy,
Numbers 12:11 He said to Moses, 'I beg you, my lord, do not hold this sin against us, which we foolishly committed and in which we sinned.'
Numbers 12:12 'Let her not be like a stillborn child, that comes out dead from its mother’s womb with its flesh already half-consumed.'
Numbers 12:13 Then Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, 'O God, I beg You, heal her!'
Numbers 12:14 The Lord answered him, 'If her father had spat in her face, would she not have been ashamed for at least seven days? Let her be separated for seven days outside the camp, and then she will be brought back.'
Numbers 12:15 So Miriam was excluded from the camp for seven days. And the people did not move on until Miriam was brought back.
Numbers 12:16 After this, they moved on from Hazeroth and encamped in the desert of Paran.
Numbers 13:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 13:2 “Send men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am about to give to the children of Israel. Send one leader from each tribe.”
Numbers 13:3 So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran, as commanded by the Lord. All of these men were leaders from among the children of Israel. These are their names:
Numbers 13:4 From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua, the son of Zaccur.
Numbers 13:5 From the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat, the son of Hori.
Numbers 13:6 From the tribe of Judah, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh.
Numbers 13:7 From the tribe of Issachar, Igal, the son of Joseph.
Numbers 13:8 From the tribe of Ephraim, Hosea, the son of Nun.
Numbers 13:9 From the tribe of Benjamin, Palti, the son of Raphu.
Numbers 13:10 From the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel, the son of Sodi.
Numbers 13:11 From the tribe of Joseph, representing the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi, the son of Susi.
Numbers 13:12 From the tribe of Dan, Ammiel, the son of Gemalli.
Numbers 13:13 From the tribe of Asher, Sethur, the son of Michael.
Numbers 13:14 From the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi, the son of Vophsi.
Numbers 13:15 From the tribe of Gad, Geuel, the son of Machi.
Numbers 13:16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. Moses also changed the name of Hosea, the son of Nun, to Joshua.
Numbers 13:17 Moses then gave them instructions: “Go up through the South, and when you reach the mountainous region,
Numbers 13:18 observe what kind of land it is. Also, observe the people who live there: are they strong or weak? Are they few in number or many?
Numbers 13:19 Are their cities fortified with walls or unwalled? Where do they live—in tents or in towns?
Numbers 13:20 Is the land fertile or barren? Are there trees in it or not? Be courageous and bring back some of the fruit of the land. Now it was the season when the first grapes were beginning to ripen.”
Numbers 13:21 So they went up and explored the land, from the wilderness of Zin all the way to Rehob, toward the entrance to Hamath.
Numbers 13:22 They went up into the South and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan, the city in Egypt.
Numbers 13:23 They came as far as the Valley of Eshcol. There, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which two men carried on a pole between them. They also took some pomegranates and figs from that place.
Numbers 13:24 That place was named Eshcol (meaning “valley of the cluster”) because of the cluster of grapes that the children of Israel carried from there.
Numbers 13:25 The explorers of the land returned after forty days.
Numbers 13:26 They came back to Moses and Aaron and to the entire assembly of the children of Israel, in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh.
Numbers 13:27 They brought the fruit of the land to them and to the whole congregation.
Numbers 13:28 And they reported to Moses, saying: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it truly flows with milk and honey, as these fruits demonstrate.
Numbers 13:29 But the people who live in it are very strong; the cities are very large and fortified. Moreover, we saw descendants of Anak there.
Numbers 13:30 The Amalekites live in the south; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites dwell in the mountainous regions; and the Canaanites occupy the area by the sea and along the Jordan River.”
Numbers 13:31 Caleb quieted the people who were murmuring against Moses and said: “Let us go up immediately and take possession of the land, for we will certainly be able to conquer it.”
Numbers 13:32 But the other men who had gone with him as explorers said: “We cannot go up against these people, because they are too strong for us.”
Numbers 13:33 So they spread a discouraging report among the children of Israel about the land they had explored, saying: “The land which we surveyed devours its inhabitants. The people whose stature we observed are exceptionally tall.
Numbers 13:34 There we saw monstrous beings, descendants of Anak—a race of giants. In comparison to them, we appeared like grasshoppers in our own eyes.”
Numbers 13:35 Then the whole congregation murmured against Moses and Aaron, and the people wept and cried all that night.
Numbers 13:36 All the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, saying: “If only we had died in Egypt, or if only we would perish here in this wilderness!
Numbers 13:37 Why has the Lord brought us to this land, only for us to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be led away as captives. Wouldn’t it be better for us to return to Egypt?”
Numbers 13:38 And one said to another: “Let us appoint a new leader and return to Egypt.”
Numbers 13:39 Upon hearing this, Moses and Aaron fell prostrate before the entire assembly of the children of Israel.
Numbers 13:40 However, Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, who themselves had also been among the explorers, tore their clothes. They spoke to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, saying: “The land which we surveyed is an exceptionally good land.”
Numbers 14:1 So the entire assembly cried out in a loud voice. And they wept all throughout that night.
Numbers 14:2 All the sons of Israel grumbled and complained against Moses and Aaron, saying: "If only we had died in Egypt, or if only we had perished in this desert!"
Numbers 14:3 "Why has the Lord brought us into this land only for us to fall in battle? Our wives and our children will be taken captive there. Wouldn't it be better for us to return to Egypt?"
Numbers 14:4 They also began to say to one another: "Let's choose a new leader for ourselves, and then we can return to Egypt."
Numbers 14:5 When Moses and Aaron heard this, they fell face down on the ground before the entire assembly of the sons of Israel.
Numbers 14:6 But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephone—who were also among those who had explored the land—tore their clothing in distress.
Numbers 14:7 And speaking to the whole assembly of the sons of Israel, they said: "The land which we have explored is exceedingly good and bountiful."
Numbers 14:8 "If the Lord is gracious to us, He will bring us into that land and give us that land, which flows with milk and honey."
Numbers 14:9 "Do not rebel against the Lord! And do not fear the people of this land, because we can surely devour them as if they were mere bread. All their protection has departed from them. The Lord is with us, so do not be afraid!"
Numbers 14:10 But when the whole assembly cried out again and wanted to overwhelm Joshua and Caleb with stones, the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of testimony before all the sons of Israel.
Numbers 14:11 And the Lord said to Moses: "How long will this people revile Me? How long will they refuse to believe Me, despite all the miraculous signs that I have performed before their eyes?"
Numbers 14:12 "Therefore, I will strike them with a pestilence and consume them. But I will make you into a great and more powerful nation than this one."
Numbers 14:13 And Moses said to the Lord: "But what if the Egyptians hear of this? They are the very people from among whom You brought out this nation!"
Numbers 14:14 "And what about the inhabitants of this land? They have heard that You, Lord, are in the midst of this people, and that Your face is seen among them in the present moment, and that Your cloud protects them, and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night."
Numbers 14:15 "If You kill this people as if they were a single man, then the nations who have heard Your great reputation will say:"
Numbers 14:16 "'He could not bring the people into the land that He had sworn to give them, and therefore He killed them in the wilderness.'"
Numbers 14:17 "Therefore, let Your strength, O Lord, be magnified, just as You swore, saying:"
Numbers 14:18 "The Lord is patient and full of great mercy, taking away iniquity and wicked deeds. Yet He does not declare the guilty innocent, for He visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, even to the third and fourth generation."
Numbers 14:19 "Forgive, I beg You, the sin of this people according to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have been gracious to them from their departure out of Egypt all the way to this place."
Numbers 14:20 The Lord said: "I have forgiven them according to your word."
Numbers 14:21 "As I live — and the glory of the Lord will fill the entire earth —"
Numbers 14:22 "Nevertheless, all the men who have seen My majesty, and the miraculous signs that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—and who have tested Me now these ten times, and have not obeyed My voice—"
Numbers 14:23 "they shall not see the land for which I swore an oath to their fathers. Not one of those who have reviled Me shall ever look upon it."
Numbers 14:24 "But My servant Caleb, because he was filled with a different spirit and fully followed Me, him I will bring into this land which he explored. And his offspring shall possess it."
Numbers 14:25 "Now, since the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, tomorrow you must turn around and depart into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea."
Numbers 14:26 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Numbers 14:27 "How long will this wicked assembly grumble against Me? I have heard the complaints of the sons of Israel."
Numbers 14:28 "Therefore, tell them: 'As I live,' says the Lord, 'just as you have spoken in My hearing, so will I do to you.'"
Numbers 14:29 "In this very wilderness, your corpses shall fall. All of you who were counted, from twenty years old and above, and who grumbled against Me,"
Numbers 14:30 "none of you shall enter the land over which I raised My hand in an oath to make you dwell in it, except Caleb, the son of Jephone, and Joshua, the son of Nun."
Numbers 14:31 "But your little ones, about whom you said they would become plunder for the enemies, these I will bring in. So they shall see the land that you despised."
Numbers 14:32 "Your own corpses, however, shall lie here in this wilderness."
Numbers 14:33 "And your children shall wander as shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and they shall bear the punishment for your infidelity, until your fathers' corpses are consumed and gone in the desert."
Numbers 14:34 "According to the number of the forty days in which you explored the land—a year shall be counted for each day. For forty years, you shall bear the punishment for your iniquities, and you will experience My vengeful justice."
Numbers 14:35 "Because just as I have spoken, so will I do to this entire wicked assembly that has risen up against Me. In this wilderness, they shall waste away and die."
Numbers 14:36 So then, all the men whom Moses had sent to explore the land, and who, upon returning, had made the entire assembly grumble against him by speaking evil about the land—
Numbers 14:37 these men died, struck down by a plague in the sight of the Lord.
Numbers 14:38 But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephone, alone remained alive out of all those who had gone to explore the land.
Numbers 14:39 And Moses spoke all these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people mourned intensely.
Numbers 14:40 And behold, rising early in the morning, they went up to the top of the mountain and said: "We are ready to go up to the place about which the Lord spoke, for we have sinned."
Numbers 15:1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 15:2 Speak to the children of Israel and tell them this: 'When you have entered the land where you will live, the land that I am giving to you,
Numbers 15:3 and you make an offering to the Lord—whether a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or a freewill offering, or one presented during your solemn feasts to produce a most pleasing aroma to the Lord from cattle or from sheep:
Numbers 15:4 those who offer the sacrifice must present a grain offering of fine flour. It will be a tenth part of an ephah, mixed with oil, of which the measure shall be a fourth part of a hin.
Numbers 15:5 And they shall give wine for a drink offering of the same measure as the oil for the burnt offering or for the sacrifice. This is for each lamb sacrificed.
Numbers 15:6 If the offering is from rams, they shall offer fine flour, two tenths of an ephah, mixed with oil, one third part of a hin.
Numbers 15:7 And for the drink offering, they shall offer wine of the same measure—a third part of a hin—as a most pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Numbers 15:8 But when you offer a bull as a burnt offering, or a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or as a peace offering:
Numbers 15:9 then for each bull, you shall give a grain offering of fine flour, three tenths of an ephah, mixed with oil, half a hin.
Numbers 15:10 And you shall offer wine for the drink offering, of the same measure, as a burnt offering of most pleasing aroma to the Lord.
Numbers 15:11 You shall do this
Numbers 15:12 for each bull, and for each ram, and for each lamb, and for each goat.
Numbers 15:13 Both the native-born and the resident alien shall perform these rituals according to the same custom.
Numbers 15:14 If any of the foreigners who live among you wish to offer a burnt offering or a sacrifice to the Lord, they shall do it exactly as you do.
Numbers 15:15 There will be one ordinance for you and for the proselytes who are resident aliens; it will be equally acceptable to God.
Numbers 15:16 There will be one law and one judgment for both you and for those who reside as strangers among you.
Numbers 15:17 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 15:18 Speak to the children of Israel and tell them this: 'When you have entered the land into which I am bringing you,
Numbers 15:19 and you eat from the food of that region, you shall set aside the first portions for the Lord.
Numbers 15:20 From the food you eat, you shall offer the first fruits, just as you do from your threshing floors.
Numbers 15:21 You shall give the first portions of your food to the Lord.
Numbers 15:22 Now, if you unintentionally sin and do not observe all the commandments that the Lord has spoken to Moses—
Numbers 15:23 all that the Lord commanded you through Moses, from the day He began to give commandments and thereafter—
Numbers 15:24 and if the entire community has forgotten something and sinned, then they shall offer a young bull from the herd as a burnt offering and a most pleasing aroma to the Lord, along with its proper grain offering and drink offering, as the ceremonies require. They shall also offer a male goat as a sin offering.
Numbers 15:25 And the priest shall make atonement for the entire community of the children of Israel, and they will be forgiven. This is because they sinned unintentionally, and they have brought their incense offering to the Lord along with their sacrifices and drink offerings for their sin.
Numbers 15:26 And the entire people of the children of Israel, and the resident aliens who live among them, shall be forgiven, because it was an unintentional fault on the part of the whole people.
Numbers 15:27 But if an individual person sins unintentionally, that person shall offer a one-year-old female goat without blemish as a sin offering.
Numbers 15:28 And the priest shall make atonement for that person who sinned unintentionally before the Lord. He shall obtain forgiveness for them, and it will be forgiven.
Numbers 15:29 There shall be one law for all who sin unintentionally, both for the native-born and for the resident alien.
Numbers 15:30 But if anyone, whether native-born or a resident alien, acts presumptuously (that is, with arrogant defiance against God), then because that person has rebelled against the Lord, they shall be cut off from their people.
Numbers 15:31 For they have despised the Word of the Lord and made His commandment void. Therefore, that person shall be utterly destroyed and shall bear the guilt of their iniquity.
Numbers 15:32 It happened that while the children of Israel were in the desert, a man was gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
Numbers 15:33 Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the entire community.
Numbers 15:34 They put him in custody, because they did not know what should be done to him.
Numbers 15:35 And the Lord said to Moses: 'That man must surely be put to death. The entire community shall stone him with rocks outside the camp.'
Numbers 15:36 So when they brought him outside the camp, the entire community pelted him with rocks, and he died.
Numbers 15:37 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 15:38 Speak to the children of Israel and tell them that they are to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their cloaks throughout their generations, and that they are to put a cord of blue on the fringe of each corner.
Numbers 15:39 When they see these fringes, they are to remember all the commandments of the Lord. They are not to stray after their own thoughts and their eyes, which lead them to spiritual unfaithfulness by lusting after various things.
Numbers 15:40 Instead, they should remember the commandments of the Lord and do them, and so be holy to your God.
Numbers 16:1 Listen now: Korah, the son of Izhar, who was the son of Kohath, who was the son of Levi— along with Dathan and Abiram, who were sons of Eliab, and Hon, who was the son of Peleth, who was the son of Reuben— these men rebelled against Moses.
Numbers 16:2 Also, two hundred and fifty other leaders from the sons of Israel joined them. These men were respected members of the council and were called by their names during times of assembly.
Numbers 16:3 These men gathered together against Moses and Aaron, and they said: 'It is enough that you two are in charge. The whole community of the people is holy, and the Lord is present among all of them. So why do you elevate yourselves above the Lord's people?'
Numbers 16:4 When Moses heard this, he fell face down to the ground in an act of deep reverence and supplication.
Numbers 16:5 Then, speaking to Korah and the entire assembly, Moses said: 'Tomorrow morning, the Lord will show who truly belongs to Him and whom He has made holy. And those whom He has chosen will be allowed to approach Him.'
Numbers 16:6 So this is what you must do: Korah, and all your followers, take your censers.
Numbers 16:7 Place fire in them and put incense on top. Tomorrow, you will offer these before the Lord. Then, whoever the Lord chooses, that person will be the holy one. You sons of Levi are being much too presumptuous.
Numbers 16:8 Moses also said to Korah: 'Listen, sons of Levi!'
Numbers 16:9 'Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from all the rest of the people and brought you close to Himself to serve Him in the worship of the Tabernacle, performing the duties for the community?'
Numbers 16:10 'And now, are you also claiming the priesthood for yourselves?'
Numbers 16:11 'Because of this, your entire assembly is actually standing against the Lord. For what has Aaron done that you should complain against him?'
Numbers 16:12 Moses sent a summons for Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they replied: 'We will not come!'
Numbers 16:13 'Is it not enough for you that you have brought us out of a land flowing with milk and honey, only to kill us in this desert, unless you also try to lord it over us?'
Numbers 16:14 'Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us possession of fields and vineyards! Are you trying to blind us as well? We will not come!'
Numbers 16:15 Moses became very angry and said to the Lord: 'Do not accept their offerings! You know that I have never taken even a single donkey from them, nor have I ever harmed any of them.'
Numbers 16:16 Moses then said to Korah: 'You and your entire congregation are to stand separately before the Lord tomorrow, and Aaron will also stand separately.'
Numbers 16:17 Let each one of you take his censer, put incense on it, and offer two hundred and fifty censers before the Lord. Aaron is also to hold his censer.
Numbers 16:18 So each man took his censer, put fire in it, and then placed incense on top. They all stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, along with Moses and Aaron.
Numbers 16:19 Korah had gathered the entire community against them at the entrance of the Tent.
Numbers 16:20 Then the glory of the Lord appeared over the entire community.
Numbers 16:21 And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Numbers 16:22 'Separate yourselves from the midst of this community, so that I may instantly destroy them.'
Numbers 16:23 They both fell face down and said: 'Oh, most mighty God of the spirits of all humankind! Will you be angry with everyone for the sin of just one man?'
Numbers 16:24 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 16:25 'Command all the people to separate themselves from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.'
Numbers 16:26 Moses then said to the crowd: 'Go away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that belongs to them, so that you are not swept away in their sins.'
Numbers 16:27 So the people moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram on every side. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing at the entrance of their own tents, along with their wives, their children, and all their young and old family members.
Numbers 16:28 And Moses said: 'By this sign, you will know that the Lord has sent me to do all these things that you see, and that I have not devised them on my own authority.'
Numbers 16:29 'If these men die a natural death, the way all people die, and if they are punished by a common human affliction, then the Lord has truly not sent me.'
Numbers 16:30 'But if the Lord does something completely new— if the earth opens its mouth and swallows them and everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the realm of the dead— then you will know for certain that these men have blasphemed the Lord.'
Numbers 16:31 Immediately, as soon as Moses finished speaking, the ground under their feet split apart.
Numbers 16:32 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them with their tents and all their possessions.
Numbers 16:33 So they went down alive into the realm of the dead. The earth closed over them, and they perished from among the community.
Numbers 16:34 All the people of Israel who stood around them, fearing this destruction, fled, crying out: 'Lest the earth swallow us too!'
Numbers 16:35 But a fire also came out from the Lord and killed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.
Numbers 16:36 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 16:37 'Command Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to take the censers that are lying in the fire, and scatter the fire from them here and there, because the censers have become holy.'
Numbers 16:38 'For they became holy because they were used by these sinners in their deaths. So order them to be hammered into thin plates and fastened to the altar. This is because the incense was offered before the Lord, and so it became holy, to serve as a sign to the sons of Israel.'
Numbers 16:39 So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which had been used by those men whom the Lord's fire had consumed, and he hammered them into thin plates and fastened them to the altar.
Numbers 16:40 This was done to serve as a permanent reminder to the sons of Israel, so that no unauthorized person— meaning, anyone not from the lineage of Aaron— would dare to approach to offer incense before the Lord, lest a similar fate happen to him, just as it happened to Korah and his entire assembly, exactly as the Lord had told Moses.
Numbers 17:17:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 17:17:2 Command Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to take the censers from the burning place, and scatter the ashes far away from this place, because they have become holy.
Numbers 17:17:3 —for they put their lives in danger—those who had sinned. The Lord has shown His favor.
Numbers 17:17:4 And from these censers, they are to make thin plates and fasten them to the altar, because they were offered in the Lord's fire and made holy. Therefore, they will serve as a sign for the children of Israel.
Numbers 17:17:5 No unauthorized person may take up incense to burn before the Lord, nor may they become like Korah and all his company. The Lord had already spoken about this.
Numbers 17:17:6 So Eleazar the priest commanded his son to take the bronze censers in which those whom the Lord's fire had consumed had offered their sacrifice. He was to flatten them into plates and fasten them to the altar.
Numbers 17:17:7 These were to be a memorial for the children of Israel, so that no outsider who is not from the lineage of Aaron would approach to offer incense to the Lord, lest he suffer a fate like Korah. This is what the Lord had said to Moses.
Numbers 17:17:8 Nevertheless, the entire congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron the next day, saying: "You have killed the Lord's people!"
Numbers 17:17:9 When the assembly had gathered against them, and Moses and Aaron saw the congregation's tents were being pulled down by the people, a cloud began to cover them, and the glory of the Lord appeared.
Numbers 17:17:10 Moses and Aaron then entered the tabernacle of testimony.
Numbers 17:17:11 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 17:17:12 "Get away from the midst of this congregation, and I will destroy them immediately." Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in supplication.
Numbers 17:17:13 Moses then said to Aaron: "Take a censer and put fire from the altar upon it. Place incense on it, and go quickly to the people to make atonement for them. For the Lord's wrath has already gone out, and a plague is raging."
Numbers 17:17:14 Aaron did as Moses had said, and he ran into the midst of the congregation. He saw that the plague had already begun among the people. He then offered the incense, performing atonement.
Numbers 17:17:15 And standing between the dead and the living, he prayed for them. And the plague was stopped.
Numbers 17:17:16 But fourteen thousand seven hundred people had already perished, in addition to those who had died in Korah's rebellion.
Numbers 17:17:17 Aaron then returned to Moses at the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony, after the plague had been stopped.
Numbers 17:17:18 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 17:17:19 "Speak to the children of Israel and take from them one rod for each of their ancestral tribes, from all the leaders of their tribes, twelve rods in total. You are to write each man's name on his rod.
Numbers 17:17:20 But you are to write Aaron's name on the rod for the tribe of Levi. Each leader of the ancestral tribes will give one rod for his tribe.
Numbers 17:17:21 You are to place these rods in the tabernacle of testimony, before the ark of the covenant—where I speak with you.
Numbers 17:17:22 The rod that I see sprout, that is the one I have chosen for myself, to put an end to the complaints of the children of Israel that they are grumbling against you.
Numbers 17:17:23 Moses then spoke to the children of Israel, and all the leaders gave him a single rod for each of their tribes and ancestral lines. There were twelve rods, not counting Aaron's rod.
Numbers 17:17:24 Moses then placed the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of testimony.
Numbers 17:17:25 The next day, when Moses returned, he found that Aaron's rod, for the house of Levi, had sprouted. It had put forth leaves, and from its clusters, flowers had already burst forth, which would ripen into almonds.
Numbers 17:17:26 Moses then brought out all the rods from the presence of the Lord to all the children of Israel. They all saw them, and each man took back his own rod.
Numbers 17:17:27 The Lord then said to Moses: "Return Aaron's rod to the tabernacle of testimony, so that it may be kept there as a sign for the rebellious children of Israel. This way, their complaints against Me will cease, and they will not die."
Numbers 17:17:28 And Moses did exactly as the Lord had commanded him.
Numbers 17:18:1 The Lord then spoke to Aaron: "You and your sons, and your father's house with you, will bear the responsibility for any offense against the sanctuary. And you and your sons together will bear the responsibility for the sins of your priesthood."
Numbers 17:18:2 "Also, take your brethren from the tribe of Levi, from your ancestral line, with you. They are to be joined to you and serve you. But you and your sons are the ones who will serve in the tabernacle of testimony itself."
Numbers 17:18:3 "They will keep watch, according to your commands, over everything that pertains to the service of the tabernacle. However, they must not approach the vessels of the sanctuary or the altar, lest both they and you die."
Numbers 17:18:4 "They are to be with you and keep watch over the duties of the tabernacle and all its ceremonies. No unauthorized person may join you."
Numbers 17:18:5 "You yourselves are to keep watch over the duties of the sanctuary and the service of the altar, so that wrath may not again arise against the children of Israel."
Numbers 17:18:6 "Look, I have given you your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel. I have given them as a gift to the Lord, so that they may serve in the ministries of the tabernacle of the covenant."
Numbers 17:18:7 "But you and your sons are to keep your priesthood, and all that pertains to the ritual of the altar and the veil. All things that are done within the sanctuary will be ministered by priests alone. No unauthorized person will approach you."
Numbers 17:18:8 The Lord then spoke to Aaron: "Look, I have given you the responsibility for My sacred offerings. All that is set apart as holy by the children of Israel, I have given to you and your sons for your duty, by a perpetual right."
Numbers 17:18:9 "Therefore, these are what you will receive from those things that are consecrated and offered to Me. All that is set apart by the children of Israel, I have given to you and your sons and daughters, by a perpetual right. You are to eat the most holy portions."
Numbers 17:18:10 "You are to eat them in the sanctuary. Only males may eat from them, because they are holy to you."
Numbers 17:18:11 "But the separated firstfruits of all the gifts of the children of Israel, and their offerings and donations, I have given to you and to your sons and your daughters by a perpetual right. Everyone in your household who is clean may eat from them."
Numbers 17:18:12 "All the best oil, and wine, and grain, whatever they offer to the Lord, I have given to you."
Numbers 18:1 The Lord then spoke to Aaron, saying: "You, your sons, and your entire ancestral house with you, will bear the moral responsibility for the purity of the sanctuary. And you and your sons together will be accountable for the sins of your priesthood."
Numbers 18:2 "But also take your brothers from the tribe of Levi—your ancestral tribe—with you. They are to be joined with you and minister to you. However, you and your sons alone will minister in the Tabernacle of the Testimony."
Numbers 18:3 "They will keep watch, obeying your instructions and performing all the work of the Tabernacle. However, they are strictly forbidden from approaching the sacred vessels of the sanctuary or the altar, lest they die, and you too, by allowing such a profanation."
Numbers 18:4 "They will be with you and keep watch over the duties of the Tabernacle and all its ceremonies. No unauthorized person—no one not appointed for this sacred service—may approach you."
Numbers 18:5 "You are to keep watch over the duties of the sanctuary and the service of the altar. Do this so that My righteous anger may no longer break out against the children of Israel."
Numbers 18:6 "For I Myself have given your brothers, the Levites, from among the children of Israel. I have handed them over as a special gift to the Lord, so that they may serve in the ministries of the Tabernacle of the Covenant."
Numbers 18:7 "But you and your sons are to guard your priesthood for all the service of the altar and the veil, and everything that is within these sacred spaces. Through this consecrated service, I have given you the priesthood. Any unauthorized person who approaches these sacred things will surely die."
Numbers 18:8 The Lord then spoke further to Aaron, saying: "Behold, I have given you the charge over the first-offerings of My blessings—all things consecrated by the children of Israel. I allot these to you and your sons by virtue of your perpetually consecrated office."
Numbers 18:9 "Therefore, these are the things you will receive from those that are consecrated and offered to the Lord: every offering, every sacrifice, and whatever is rendered to Me for sin and for trespass, and whatever belongs to the most holy things. This will be yours and your sons'."
Numbers 18:10 "You will eat these in the sanctuary. Only males may eat of them, because they are consecrated specifically for you."
Numbers 18:11 "Also, the first-offerings of all your gifts and everything the children of Israel offer, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters by a perpetual right. Anyone who is ritually clean in your household may eat of them."
Numbers 18:12 "All the choicest part of the oil, and of the wine, and of the grain—whatever they offer to the Lord as first-fruits—I have given to you."
Numbers 18:13 "Whatever first grows in the land and is brought to the Lord will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ritually clean may eat of it."
Numbers 18:14 "Every devoted thing—whatever has been consecrated to utter destruction or exclusion from common use in Israel—will be yours."
Numbers 18:15 "Everything that opens the womb of all flesh that they offer to the Lord, whether of humans or of animals, and the firstborn of men and of beasts, will be yours."
Numbers 18:16 "However, for the firstborn of humans, you must receive a redemption price. Unclean animals will be redeemed with money: from one month old, at a value of six shekels of silver, according to the standard weight of the sanctuary. A shekel has twenty *obols*—or *gerahs*."
Numbers 18:17 "But the firstborn of an ox, or a sheep, or a goat, you shall not have redeemed, because they are consecrated to the Lord. You will only pour their blood upon the altar, and you yourselves may eat their meat."
Numbers 18:18 "And this meat will be consecrated to you, just like the consecrated breast and the right shoulder are given to you."
Numbers 18:19 "All the consecrated first-offerings that the children of Israel offer to the Lord, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters by a perpetual right. This is an everlasting covenant of salt—a sacred, unbreakable agreement—before the Lord, for you and your sons."
Numbers 18:20 The Lord also spoke to Aaron: "You will possess nothing in their land, nor will you have any inheritance among them, for I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel."
Numbers 18:21 "But to the children of Levi, I have given all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance, for the service by which they minister to Me in the Tabernacle of the Covenant."
Numbers 18:22 "This is so that the children of Israel may no longer approach the Tabernacle directly and thereby incur the sin that brings death."
Numbers 18:23 "Only the Levites will serve Me in the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and they will bear their own sins related to this service—meaning they will be held accountable for any failures in their duties. This will be an everlasting sacred ordinance throughout your generations. They will possess nothing else as property, for their unique role,"
Numbers 18:24 "They will be content with the offering of tithes, which I have set apart for their use and necessities."
Numbers 18:25 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 18:26 "Command the Levites, and declare to them: When you receive the tithes from the children of Israel, which I have given to you for your needs, you must set apart from them a first-offering for the Lord. This is to be the tenth part of the tithe you received."
Numbers 18:27 "This will be reckoned to you as an offering of first-fruits, just as if it were from the threshing floor or from the winepress."
Numbers 18:28 "Thus, from all the first-offerings that you receive, present a first-offering to the Lord, and give it to Aaron the priest."
Numbers 18:29 "From all the sacred gifts and tithes, you will consecrate to the Lord the choicest and the very best part."
Numbers 18:30 "And you are to say to them: 'If you eat the rich and choice portions from these offerings, you will not incur sin, because neither you nor your sons will be defiled by eating that which is sacred, provided you have properly offered the Lord's choicest portion beforehand.'"
Numbers 18:31 "You and your households may eat these offerings in any of your dwelling places, because it is your reward for your service in the Tabernacle of the Testimony."
Numbers 18:32 "You will not incur sin concerning this matter—meaning eating the portion given to you—provided you do not profane the first-offerings of the children of Israel, which are consecrated to the Lord. If you profane them, you will surely die."
Numbers 19:1 The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, giving them this instruction:
Numbers 19:2 “This is the ordinance for a specific offering which the Lord has established: Command the children of Israel to bring you a red heifer that is without blemish, and which has no imperfection, and which has never had a yoke placed upon it.
Numbers 19:3 And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, who shall lead the heifer outside the camp and sacrifice it in the sight of everyone.
Numbers 19:4 And Eleazar will dip his finger into its blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times towards the front of the Tent of Meeting.
Numbers 19:5 Then, in Eleazar’s sight, the heifer shall be burned completely: its hide, its flesh, its blood, and its dung shall all be consumed by the fire.
Numbers 19:6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet yarn dyed twice, and throw them into the fire that is burning the heifer.
Numbers 19:7 Afterward, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; only then may he enter the camp. However, he will remain ritually unclean until evening.
Numbers 19:8 Similarly, the one who burned the heifer must also wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, and he too will remain ritually unclean until evening.
Numbers 19:9 Then, a ritually clean man shall gather the ashes of the heifer and pour them out outside the camp in a very clean place. These ashes are to be kept by the congregation of the children of Israel to prepare the water of purification for sprinkling—because the heifer was burned as a sin offering to remove uncleanness.
Numbers 19:10 And the man who carried the ashes must wash his clothes, and he too will be ritually unclean until evening. This ordinance shall be a perpetual statute for the children of Israel and for the foreigners who live among them.
Numbers 19:11 Whoever touches the dead body of a human being will become ritually unclean for seven days because of that contact.
Numbers 19:12 Such a person must purify himself with this water on the third day and on the seventh day; only then will he be clean. If he is not purified on the third day, then he will not be made clean on the seventh day either.
Numbers 19:13 Anyone who touches a dead human body and does not purify himself with this mixture of water will defile the Lord’s Tent of Meeting and must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of purification was not sprinkled upon him, he remains ritually unclean, and his uncleanness stays upon him.
Numbers 19:14 This is the law concerning a man who dies within a tent: Everyone who enters that tent, and all the objects within it, will become ritually defiled for seven days.
Numbers 19:15 Any open vessel that does not have a lid or a covering sealed upon it will also become ritually unclean.
Numbers 19:16 If anyone in the open field touches a person who has died naturally, or a person who has been killed, or touches someone dead in any other manner, that person will be ritually unclean for seven days.
Numbers 19:17 For the unclean person, some of the ashes from the burnt offering made for sin must be taken and mixed with running spring water in a vessel.
Numbers 19:18 Then a ritually clean person shall dip a sprig of hyssop into this mixture and sprinkle it on the tent and all its furnishings, and on the people who were in the tent, and on anyone who touched a dead body—whether it was buried, or killed, or merely human bones, or a grave.
Numbers 19:19 And the ritually clean person shall sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and on the seventh day. After being purified on the seventh day, the unclean person must wash his own clothes and bathe himself, and then he will be ritually clean by evening.
Numbers 19:20 But if anyone who is ritually unclean is not purified by this prescribed rite, that person will be cut off from the assembly of the people. This is because he has defiled the Lord’s Holy Sanctuary by remaining unclean, and the water of purification was not sprinkled on him. Such a person remains ritually unclean.
Numbers 19:21 This shall be an enduring, lawful commandment. The person who sprinkles the water of purification must wash his clothes. And anyone who merely touches the water of purification will become ritually unclean until evening.
Numbers 19:22 Whatever the ritually unclean person touches will become ritually unclean; and any person who touches that unclean person will also become ritually unclean until evening.

Numbers 20:1 The children of Israel, the whole multitude of them, entered the desert of Sin in the first month. The people settled in Kadesh, and there, Mary—the sister of Moses and Aaron—died and was buried.
Numbers 20:2 But when the multitude needed water, they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.
Numbers 20:3 They argued with Moses and said, "We wish we had died with our brothers before the Lord!"
Numbers 20:4 Why did you bring the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness, for us and our livestock to die here?
Numbers 20:5 Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us to this terrible place? It is a place where nothing can be sown, and there are no fig trees, no grapevines, no pomegranates, and no water!
Numbers 20:6 So Moses and Aaron left the multitude and went to the Tent of the Covenant. They fell face down on the ground, crying out to the Lord and saying, "Lord God, we have cried out to You, saying: Your people are perishing!" And the glory of the Lord appeared over them.
Numbers 20:7 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 20:8 Take the staff, and gather the people—you and Aaron your brother. Speak to the rock in front of them, and it will give them water. When you bring forth water from the rock, the whole multitude and their livestock will drink.
Numbers 20:9 So Moses took the staff from before the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded him.
Numbers 20:10 Then, after gathering the crowds before the rock, Moses said to them, "Listen, you rebels and unbelievers! Do you think we can bring water out for you from this rock?"
Numbers 20:11 Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice. A great abundance of water gushed out, so much that the people and their livestock drank.
Numbers 20:12 And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust Me enough to show My holiness before the children of Israel, you will not lead these people into the land that I will give them."
Numbers 20:13 This is the Water of Contradiction, where the children of Israel argued against the Lord, and where His holiness was manifested among them.
Numbers 20:14 In the meantime, Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom to say this: "Your brother Israel sends this message: You know all the hardship that has come upon us."
Numbers 20:15 Our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived there for a long time. The Egyptians afflicted both us and our fathers.
Numbers 20:16 And we cried out to the Lord, and He heard us and sent an angel who led us out of Egypt. Now, here we are, in the city of Kadesh, right at the edge of your territory.
Numbers 20:17 We beg you, allow us to pass through your land. We will not go through the fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from your wells. We will travel only on the public road and will not turn right or left until we have passed through your borders.
Numbers 20:18 Edom answered him, "You shall not pass through my land; otherwise, I will come out against you with weapons."
Numbers 20:19 And the children of Israel said, "We will go along the beaten path. And if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay you for it. We only ask that you let us pass through quickly."
Numbers 20:20 But Edom replied, "You will not be allowed to pass." And immediately, he came out to meet them with a vast army and great strength.
Numbers 20:21 Edom refused to let Israel pass through his territory, so Israel turned away from him.
Numbers 20:22 After they moved their camp from Kadesh, they came to Mount Hor, which is on the border of the land of Edom.
Numbers 20:23 There, on Mount Hor, at the borders of the land of Edom, the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Numbers 20:24 Take Aaron and gather him to his people—meaning, he will die. For he will not enter the land that I have given to the children of Israel, because he was disobedient to My command at the Water of Contradiction.
Numbers 20:25 Take Aaron and his son Eleazar, and lead them up to Mount Hor.
Numbers 20:26 When you have stripped the father of his vestments, dress his son Eleazar in them. Aaron will then be gathered to his people—he will die there.
Numbers 20:27 Moses did just as the Lord had commanded, in front of the whole multitude, and they went up Mount Hor.
Numbers 20:28 And when Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, he dressed his son Eleazar in them.
Numbers 20:29 Aaron died there, on the summit of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
Numbers 21:1 When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the south, heard that Israel was coming by the way of the spies, he fought against them and gained a partial victory over them.
Numbers 21:2 So Israel made a solemn vow to the Lord and said, 'If You deliver this people into my hand, I will utterly destroy their cities.'
Numbers 21:3 And the Lord heard Israel's prayers and delivered the Canaanites to them. Israel utterly destroyed them and their cities, and they named that place Hormah, which means 'utterly destroyed and consecrated to God'.
Numbers 21:4 And they set out from Mount Hor, taking the road that leads to the Red Sea, in order to go around the land of Edom. The people became impatient due to the long journey and the hardships.
Numbers 21:5 And speaking against God and against Moses, they said, 'Why have you led us out of Egypt, only for us to die in this wasteland? There is no bread here, and no water. Our souls are disgusted by this very light food' —referring to the manna God miraculously provided.
Numbers 21:6 For this reason, the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, which bit them, and many of the Israelites died.
Numbers 21:7 Therefore, the people came to Moses and said, 'We have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and against you. Pray that He may take away these serpents from us.' And Moses prayed for the people.
Numbers 21:8 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 'Make a bronze serpent, and set it up as a standard. Whoever is bitten, when he looks at it, will live.'
Numbers 21:9 So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it up as a standard. When those who were bitten looked at it, they were healed.
Numbers 21:10 And the children of Israel set out and encamped in Oboth.
Numbers 21:11 From there, they journeyed and pitched their tents in Ije-Abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab, towards the eastern side.
Numbers 21:12 And from there, they set out and came to the valley of Zered.
Numbers 21:13 From there they departed and encamped beyond the Arnon River, which is in the wilderness and flows from the border of the Amorites. For the Arnon is the border of Moab, lying between the Midianites and the Amorites.
Numbers 21:14 Therefore, it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord: 'As He did at the Red Sea, so He did at the torrents of Arnon.'
Numbers 21:15 The channels of the torrents curved down to the land of the cities, extending all the way to the borders of Moab.
Numbers 21:16 From there they came to the well; this is the well about which the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 'Gather the people, and I will give them water.'
Numbers 21:17 Then Israel sang this song: 'Spring up, O well! Let the people sing to it.'
Numbers 21:18 This is the well that the princes dug, and which the leaders of the people prepared, guided by the Lawgiver —Moses— and with their staffs. From the wilderness of Mattanah, they went to Nahaliel.
Numbers 21:19 From Nahaliel, they went on to Bamoth.
Numbers 21:20 From Bamoth, they traveled to the valley that is in the region of Moab, on the summit of Pisgah, overlooking the desert.
Numbers 21:21 And Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying:
Numbers 21:22 'Allow us to pass through your land. We will not turn aside through your fields or through your vineyards. We will not drink water from your wells. But we will travel along the King's Highway until we have passed through your borders.'
Numbers 21:23 But Sihon did not permit Israel to pass through his borders. Instead, he gathered a large army, went out against them into the wilderness, came to Jahaz, and fought against them.
Numbers 21:24 And Israel struck him down with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River, and up to the children of Ammon. For the boundary of the Amorites at the Jabbok River was a strong and fortified boundary.
Numbers 21:25 So Israel took all his cities and dwelt in the cities of the Amorites, specifically in Heshbon and its surrounding villages.
Numbers 21:26 For Heshbon had been the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon River.
Numbers 21:27 Therefore, people speak in a proverb, saying: 'Come to Heshbon! Let it be rebuilt, and let the city of Sihon be restored!'
Numbers 21:28 For fire went forth from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon, and it devoured Ar of Moab, along with the inhabitants of the high places of Arnon.
Numbers 21:29 Woe to you, Moab! You are ruined, O people of Chemosh —your national god—! He gave his sons who fled, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon, king of the Amorites.
Numbers 21:30 Their yoke was broken from Heshbon even to Dibon. They perished as far as Nophah and as far as Medeba.
Numbers 21:31 So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
Numbers 21:32 And Moses sent men to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and took possession of its inhabitants.
Numbers 21:33 Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. And Og, the king of Bashan, with all his people, came out to meet them at Edrei and fought against them.
Numbers 21:34 And the Lord said to Moses, 'Do not fear him, for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.'
Numbers 21:35 So they struck down Og and his sons and all his people until not a single survivor remained, and they took possession of his land.
Numbers 22:1 The Sons of Israel then broke camp and set up their tents in the plains of Moab, on the other side of the Jordan River, directly opposite Jericho.
Numbers 22:2 Now Balak, the son of Zippor, saw everything that the Sons of Israel had done to the Amorites.
Numbers 22:3 Moab was greatly afraid and was terrified at the sight of the people because there were so many of them.
Numbers 22:4 So they said to the elders of Midian: 'This people will now consume all of our surrounding lands, just as an ox eats grass down to its roots.' At that time, Balak, the son of Zippor, was king in Moab.
Numbers 22:5 So Balak sent messengers to Balaam, the son of Beor, a diviner who lived by the river in the land of the sons of Ammab, to call him and say: 'Behold, a people has come out of Egypt who now cover the face of the earth, and they are settled directly opposite me.'
Numbers 22:6 'Therefore, come now and curse this people for me, because they are stronger than I am. Perhaps then I will be able to strike them and drive them out of my land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.'
Numbers 22:7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went, carrying the fee for divination in their hands. When they came to Balaam and told him all the words of Balak,
Numbers 22:8 he answered: 'Stay here tonight, and I will tell you whatever the Lord says to me.' So they stayed with Balaam.
Numbers 22:9 God came to Balaam and said to him: 'Who are these men with you?'
Numbers 22:10 Balaam answered: 'Balak, the son of Zippor, the king of the Moabites, has sent word to me,' -
Numbers 22:11 saying: 'Behold, a people has come out of Egypt and now covers the face of the earth. Come and curse them for me, so that perhaps I can fight against them and drive them out.'
Numbers 22:12 And God said to Balaam: 'Do not go with them, and do not curse the people, because they are blessed.'
Numbers 22:13 Balaam rose early in the morning and said to Balak's officials: 'Go back to your own land, because the Lord has forbidden me to come with you.'
Numbers 22:14 The officials returned and told Balak: 'Balaam refused to come with us.'
Numbers 22:15 Again, Balak sent more messengers, and they were more numerous and more honorable than the first ones.
Numbers 22:16 When they came to Balaam, they said: 'This is what Balak, the son of Zippor, says: Please do not let anything stop you from coming to me!'
Numbers 22:17 'I will bestow great honor upon you, and whatever you wish, I will give you. Come, therefore, and curse this people for me.'
Numbers 22:18 Balaam answered: 'Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not change the word of the Lord, my God, to speak anything, great or small, contrary to it.'
Numbers 22:19 'Please, you also stay here tonight, so that I may know what the Lord will say to me again.'
Numbers 22:20 So God came to Balaam at night and said to him: 'If these men have come to call you, then get up and go with them. Nevertheless, only do what I command you.'
Numbers 22:21 Balaam rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the officials of Moab.
Numbers 22:22 And God was angry at him for going. The Angel of the Lord stood in the way against him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and he had two servants with him.
Numbers 22:23 The donkey saw the Angel standing in the road with a drawn sword, and it turned off the road and went into the field. Balaam began to beat it, trying to force it back onto the road.
Numbers 22:24 Then the Angel stood in a narrow path between two walls, where vineyards were enclosed.
Numbers 22:25 When the donkey saw the Angel, it pressed itself against the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against it. And he beat it again.
Numbers 22:26 The Angel then passed further on and stood in an even narrower place, where there was no room to turn either to the right or to the left.
Numbers 22:27 When the donkey saw the Angel standing there, it collapsed under Balaam, who was riding it. Balaam became even more furious and beat its side with a stick.
Numbers 22:28 Then the Lord opened the mouth of the donkey, and it spoke: 'What have I done to you? Why have you beaten me these three times already?'
Numbers 22:29 Balaam answered: 'Because you have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword, I would kill you!'
Numbers 22:30 The donkey said: 'Am I not your own donkey, on which you have ridden all your life until this very day? Have I ever done such a thing to you before?' He answered: 'No, never.'
Numbers 22:31 Immediately, the Lord opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the Angel standing in the road with a drawn sword, blocking his way. And Balaam bowed down, prostrating himself on the ground in worship.
Numbers 22:32 And the Angel said: 'Why have you beaten your donkey these three times already? I have come to stand against you, because your way is perverse and contrary to my will.'
Numbers 22:33 'If the donkey had not turned aside from the road, I would have killed you and spared its life.'
Numbers 22:34 Balaam said: 'I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in my way. Now, if it displeases you, I will turn back.'
Numbers 22:35 The Angel said to Balaam: 'Go with these men, but only speak what I command you.'
Numbers 22:36 So Balaam went with Balak's officials. When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him in the city of the Moabites, which is situated on the border of the Arnon River.
Numbers 22:37 And Balak said to Balaam: 'Did we not send messengers to you to call you? Why did you not come to me immediately? Do you truly believe that I cannot reward you with enough honor?'
Numbers 22:38 Balaam answered him: 'Behold, I am here now. Can I speak anything more than what God puts into my mouth?'
Numbers 22:39 So they went together and came to the city that was on the outermost borders of his kingdom.
Numbers 22:40 So Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and he sent some of the meat to Balaam and to the officials who were with him.
Numbers 23:1 Balaam then said to Balak, 'Build seven altars for me here' — these were for the pagan sacrifices Balaam was about to perform — 'and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for them.'
Numbers 23:2 Balak did exactly what Balaam had told him. He placed a young bull and a ram on each of the seven altars for sacrifice.
Numbers 23:3 Balaam then said to Balak, 'Stay here by your burnt offering for a little while. I am going to see if the Lord will meet me; whatever He reveals to me, I will tell you.'
Numbers 23:4 So Balaam went off quickly. And God met him.
Numbers 23:5 And the Lord spoke to Balaam, putting a specific message into his mouth. The Lord said, 'Go back to Balak, and this is what you are to say.'
Numbers 23:6 Balaam returned and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering, along with all the leaders of the Moabites.
Numbers 23:7 Then Balaam delivered his prophetic message, saying: 'Balak, the king of the Moabites, brought me here from Aram, from the mountains in the east. He told me, "Come, put a curse on Jacob's people! Hurry, denounce Israel!"'
Numbers 23:8 But how can I curse those whom God Himself has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the Lord has not denounced?
Numbers 23:9 From these high rocks, I see the people of Israel; from these hills, I look upon them. They are a people who will live apart, unique and distinct, and they will not be counted among the other nations.
Numbers 23:10 Who could possibly count the countless descendants of Jacob, or number even a quarter of the people of Israel? May my own soul die the death of the righteous, and may my final end be like theirs!
Numbers 23:11 Balak then said to Balaam, 'What are you doing? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but instead, you have blessed them!'
Numbers 23:12 Balaam answered him, 'Do I not have to speak exactly what the Lord puts into my mouth and commands me to say?'
Numbers 23:13 Then Balak said, 'Come with me to another place, from where you can see only a part of the Israelites, but not all of them. Perhaps from there you can curse them for me.'
Numbers 23:14 So Balak led Balaam to a high lookout point, the summit of Mount Pisgah. There, Balak built another seven altars and placed a young bull and a ram on each.
Numbers 23:15 Balaam said to Balak, 'Stay here by your burnt offering, while I go to meet with the Lord again.'
Numbers 23:16 And when the Lord met Balaam, He again put a specific message into his mouth. The Lord said, 'Go back to Balak, and this is what you are to say to him.'
Numbers 23:17 Balaam returned and found Balak still standing by his burnt offering, with the leaders of Moab assembled with him.
Numbers 23:18 When Balaam announced his return, Balak immediately asked, 'What has the Lord spoken this time?'
Numbers 23:19 Then Balaam delivered his prophetic message, saying: 'God is not a mere man, that He should lie; nor is He a son of man, that He should change His mind or regret His decisions.'
Numbers 23:20 Has God said something, and He will not do it? Has He spoken a word, and He will not bring it to pass?
Numbers 23:21 God sees no iniquity in Jacob, and He sees no evil or trouble in Israel to curse them for.
Numbers 23:22 The Lord their God is with them, and the joyful shout of their King's triumph is heard among them.
Numbers 23:23 For there is no magic spell that can work against Jacob, nor any divination that can succeed against Israel.
Numbers 23:24 At the proper time, it will be said of Jacob and Israel, 'See what great things God has accomplished for them!'
Numbers 23:25 Balak said to Balaam, 'What is this you are doing? You are neither cursing them, nor are you blessing them!'
Numbers 23:26 Balaam answered him, 'Did I not tell you that whatever the Lord commands, that is what I must speak?'
Numbers 23:27 Then Balak said to him, 'Come, I will lead you to yet another place. Perhaps from there, it will finally please God to let you curse them for me.'
Numbers 23:28 So Balak led Balaam to the very top of Mount Peor, which overlooks the desolate wilderness.
Numbers 23:29 Balaam said to Balak, 'Build seven more altars for me here, and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams again.'
Numbers 23:30 Balak did exactly as Balaam had earnestly requested, placing a young bull and a ram on each of the altars.
Numbers 23:31 When Balaam saw that it truly pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he no longer went off by himself, as was his custom, to seek divination or omens. Instead, he fixed his gaze toward the wilderness,
Numbers 23:32 and as he looked up, he saw Israel encamped, tribe by tribe. Then the Spirit of God powerfully came upon him,
Numbers 23:33 and Balaam delivered his prophetic message, saying: 'This is the declaration of Balaam, son of Beor; the declaration of the man whose spiritual eyes have been opened by God;'
Numbers 23:34 He declares what he heard of the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty while in a trance, receiving divine light and revelation.
Numbers 23:35 How beautiful are your dwelling places, O Jacob! How lovely are your tents, O Israel!
Numbers 23:36 They are like lush valleys stretching out, like gardens beside flowing rivers, like the tents that the Lord Himself has pitched, like cedar trees standing tall by abundant waters.
Numbers 23:37 Water will flow abundantly from their buckets, and their descendants will spread out like abundant waters, growing and multiplying.
Numbers 23:38 Their king shall be more exalted than Agag—a symbol of powerful, hostile rulers—and his kingdom shall be lifted up in greatness.
Numbers 23:39 God brought them out of Egypt, and His strength is like the immense power of a wild ox.
Numbers 23:40 They shall devour the nations that are their enemies, they shall crush their bones, and pierce them through with their arrows.
Numbers 24:1 Balaam realized that the Lord intended to bless Israel. So, unlike his previous attempts, he did not go out to look for omens or divination; instead, he directed his gaze towards the wilderness.
Numbers 24:2 He lifted his eyes and saw Israel encamped, tribe by tribe. Then, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him.
Numbers 24:3 He then delivered his prophetic message, saying:
Numbers 24:4 “This is the oracle of Balaam, son of Beor. This is the oracle of the man whose spiritual eyes have been opened.”
Numbers 24:5 “This is the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees visions from the Almighty. He falls into a trance, yet his spiritual eyes are opened to divine revelations.”
Numbers 24:6 “How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, and your dwellings, O Israel.”
Numbers 24:7 “They are like shaded valleys, like gardens beside flowing rivers. They are like the dwellings the Lord Himself has set up, like cedars growing near abundant waters.”
Numbers 24:8 “Water will flow from his buckets, ensuring abundant prosperity. His offspring will spread widely, like many waters. His king will be exalted above Agag, and his kingdom will be lifted high.”
Numbers 24:9 “He lies down like a lion, and like a lioness, none dare awaken him. Blessed is he who blesses you, and cursed is he who curses you.”
Numbers 24:10 Enraged, Balak clapped his hands in anger at Balaam and said, “I called you to curse my enemies, but instead, you have blessed them these three times!”
Numbers 24:11 “Therefore, flee back to your own home! I had promised you great honor, but the Lord Himself has deprived you of that honor.”
Numbers 24:12 Balaam answered, “Did I not tell your messengers, whom you sent to me before, saying:”
Numbers 24:13 “‘Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the command of the Lord my God to speak anything, whether small or great, on my own authority. I can only speak what God says.’”
Numbers 24:14 “Nevertheless, now I am going back to my own people. But first, I will advise you on what this people, Israel, will do to your people in the last days.”
Numbers 24:15 Then he delivered his prophetic message once more, saying: “This is the oracle of Balaam, son of Beor. This is the oracle of the man whose spiritual eyes have been opened.”
Numbers 24:16 “This is the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who understands the knowledge of the Most High, and who sees visions from the Almighty. He falls into a trance, yet his eyes remain open to divine revelations.”
Numbers 24:17 “I see him, but not in this present time. I behold him, but not nearby. A star will rise from Jacob, and a scepter will emerge from Israel. He will crush the leaders of Moab and destroy all the sons of Seth.”
Numbers 24:18 “Edom will become his possession, and Seir will be his inheritance. Israel will act with great strength.”
Numbers 24:19 “From Jacob will come a ruler who will destroy the remnant that survives from the city.”
Numbers 24:20 When Balaam saw Amalek, he delivered his prophetic message, saying: “Amalek was once the foremost among the nations, but its end will be utter destruction.”
Numbers 24:21 He also saw the Kenites, and delivering his prophetic message, he said: “How strong is your dwelling place! You have set your nest securely in the rock.”
Numbers 24:22 “Nevertheless, you too will be plundered and carried away, until Asshur takes you captive.”
Numbers 24:23 And again, he delivered his prophetic message, saying: “Alas! Who will survive when God brings these things to pass?”
Numbers 24:24 “Warships will come from Italy, and they will afflict Asshur and also the Hebrews. And they themselves, the invaders, will perish in the end.”
Numbers 24:25 Then Balaam rose up and returned to his own place. Balak also departed by the way he had come.
Numbers 25:1 The people of Israel settled in the region of Sittim, and they committed grave sin by engaging in fornication with the daughters of Moab.
Numbers 25:2 These women then invited the Israelite men to the sacrifices offered to their pagan gods. And the Israelite men ate the sacrificial food and worshipped these false gods.
Numbers 25:3 In this way, Israel consecrated themselves to Baal-Peor, a false god of the Moabites. Because of this, the Lord became very angry with them.
Numbers 25:4 Then the Lord said to Moses: 'Take all the leaders of the people who have committed this sin, and execute them publicly before the sun, by hanging them up for all to see. Do this so that my fierce anger may be turned away from the people of Israel.'
Numbers 25:5 And so, Moses said to the judges of Israel: 'Let each of you, with your own hand, kill those among your kinsmen who have consecrated themselves to Baal-Peor.'
Numbers 25:6 And behold, while Moses and the entire assembly of the sons of Israel were weeping in repentance at the entrance of the tabernacle, one of the sons of Israel went openly before his brothers to a Midianite prostitute.
Numbers 25:7 When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, who was the son of Aaron the priest, saw this sinful act, he rose from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand.
Numbers 25:8 He followed the Israelite man into the tent where the sin was being committed, and he pierced both of them through at the same time—the man and the woman, right through their reproductive organs. Immediately, the plague among the sons of Israel stopped.
Numbers 25:9 Before the plague stopped, twenty-four thousand people had been killed.
Numbers 25:10 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 25:11 'Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my divine wrath away from the sons of Israel. He did this because he was stirred up with my own divine zeal against them. And because of his action, I did not destroy the sons of Israel as I was angry enough to do.'
Numbers 25:12 'Therefore, tell him: Behold, I am giving him my covenant of peace.'
Numbers 25:13 'This covenant will be for him and for his descendants after him, a perpetual covenant of the priesthood. This is because he was zealous for his God, and in doing so, he made atonement for the wickedness of the sons of Israel.'
Numbers 25:14 Now the name of the Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite prostitute was Zimri, the son of Salu. He was a leader of a family and a tribe within Simeon.
Numbers 25:15 And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed with him was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, who was a noble chieftain of the Midianites.
Numbers 25:16 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 25:17 'Consider the Midianites your enemies, and you must strike them down.'
Numbers 25:18 'You must strike them down because they also acted hostilely against you. They deceived you through the idol Peor, and through Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, who was one of their own, and who was killed on the day of the plague because of the wickedness involving Peor.'
Numbers 26:1 After that great plague, in which so many had died, the Lord God spoke to Moses and to Eleazar, Aaron’s son, who was the priest.
Numbers 26:2 Take a census of all the people of Israel, starting from twenty years old and upwards, counting them according to their family lines and households. Include everyone who is able to go out to war.
Numbers 26:3 So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke in the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, to all those who were twenty years old and upwards, just as the Lord God had commanded them.
Numbers 26:4 These are the names of the sons of Israel, who had come out of the land of Egypt. Reuben was the firstborn of Israel.

Numbers 26:9 The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram who were prominent leaders in the assembly, and who rebelled against Moses and Aaron during Korah’s rebellion, when they rebelled against the Lord God.
Numbers 26:10 The earth then opened up and swallowed them and Korah, in the midst of their destruction, at the time when the fire consumed two hundred and fifty men. That was a great and fearsome warning from God.
Numbers 26:11 However, the sons of Korah did not die.

Numbers 26:33 Moreover, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, had no sons, but only daughters. Their names were: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
Numbers 26:34 These were the families of the tribe of Manasseh. Their registered number was fifty-two thousand, seven hundred men.

Numbers 27:1 The daughters of Zelophehad approached. He was the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph. These were their names: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
Numbers 27:2 They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people at the entrance of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, and they spoke:
Numbers 27:3 Our father died in the desert. He was not among those who rebelled against the Lord with Korah. Instead, he died for his own sins, just like all of his generation in the desert. He had no sons.
Numbers 27:4 Why should our father's name be cut off from his family just because he had no son? Give us a land inheritance among our father’s relatives.
Numbers 27:5 So Moses brought their legal case before the Lord for judgment.
Numbers 27:6 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 27:7 The daughters of Zelophehad are speaking correctly. Give them a land inheritance among their father’s relatives, and let them inherit his portion of the land.
Numbers 27:8 Also, you must speak to the sons of Israel regarding this law: If a man dies without a son, his inheritance will pass to his daughter.
Numbers 27:9 If he has no daughter, then his brothers will inherit from him.
Numbers 27:10 But if he has no brothers, you will give his inheritance to his father's relatives.
Numbers 27:11 And if his father also has no relatives, then the inheritance will be given to those who are nearest to him in family relationship. This will be a holy and permanent law for the sons of Israel.
Numbers 27:12 Then the Lord said to Moses: "Go up this Abarim mountain, and from there, look at the land that I am about to give to the sons of Israel."
Numbers 27:13 When you have seen it, you will be gathered to your ancestors in death, just as your brother Aaron was gathered.
Numbers 27:14 This is because you offended Me in the Desert of Sin during the contention of the multitude, and you did not show My holiness before the people at the waters.
Numbers 27:15 And Moses responded:
Numbers 27:16 "May the Lord, the God of the spirits of all humankind, appoint a man to be over this multitude of people."
Numbers 27:17 "Let this man go out before them and come in before them, and let him lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the Lord may not be like sheep without a shepherd."
Numbers 27:18 Then the Lord said to Moses: "Take Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom the Spirit is present, and lay your hand upon him."
Numbers 27:19 "He will stand before Eleazar the priest and all the assembly of the sons of Israel. You are to give him instructions in the hearing of everyone."
Numbers 27:20 "And you will give him some of your authority and honor, so that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may obey him."
Numbers 27:21 "If anything needs to be done, Eleazar the priest will consult the Lord for him, using the Urim and Thummim. Joshua, and all the sons of Israel with him, along with the rest of the multitude, will go out and come in according to Eleazar's judgment and divine answers from the Lord."
Numbers 27:22 So Moses did just as the Lord had commanded. He took Joshua and presented him before Eleazar the priest and all the assembly of the people.
Numbers 27:23 And Moses laid his hands on Joshua's head, ordaining him just as the Lord had commanded.
Numbers 28:1 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying to him:
Numbers 28:2 “Command the children of Israel and tell them: ‘You must offer my sacred gifts to me at their appointed times. These offerings include the bread and the burnt sacrifices that produce a pleasing aroma.’”
Numbers 28:3 “These are the sacrifices you must offer: two perfect, year-old male lambs each day as a perpetual burnt offering.”
Numbers 28:4 “One lamb in the morning, and the other in the evening.”
Numbers 28:5 “And for the grain offering, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of pure olive oil.”
Numbers 28:6 “This is the perpetual burnt offering, the same as what you offered on Mount Sinai, which produced a pleasing aroma and was a sacrifice made by fire to the Lord.”
Numbers 28:7 “For their drink offerings, you must pour out a quarter of a hin of strong wine for each lamb in the Lord's sanctuary.”
Numbers 28:8 “And you will offer the other lamb in the evening, according to the ritual of the morning sacrifice and its drink offerings—you must offer them both together.”
Numbers 28:9 “On the Sabbath day, you must offer two perfect, year-old male lambs, along with two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil, as a grain offering, and its drink offerings.”
Numbers 28:10 “These are the burnt offerings for each Sabbath, in addition to the regular daily burnt offering and its drink offering.”
Numbers 28:11 “Also, at the beginning of each month—on the New Moon—you must offer a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven perfect, year-old male lambs.”
Numbers 28:12 “And for the grain offering with each bull, three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil. And with the one ram, two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil.”
Numbers 28:13 “And with each lamb, one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil. This is a burnt offering that produces a pleasing aroma, a sacrifice made by fire to the Lord.”
Numbers 28:14 “Their drink offerings will be as follows: half a hin of wine for each bull, a third of a hin for the ram, and a quarter of a hin for each lamb. This will be the perpetual burnt offering that you must offer each month throughout the year.”
Numbers 28:15 “And you must also offer one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its drink offerings.”
Numbers 28:16 “In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is the Lord's Passover.”
Numbers 28:17 “And on the fifteenth day of that same month, there will be a solemn feast. For seven days, unleavened bread must be eaten.”
Numbers 28:18 “On the first day of this feast, there will be a sacred assembly, and you must not do any ordinary work.”
Numbers 28:19 “You must offer a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven perfect, year-old male lambs.”
Numbers 28:20 “And for their grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil, three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, and two-tenths of an ephah for the ram.”
Numbers 28:21 “And for each of the seven lambs, one-tenth of an ephah.”
Numbers 28:22 “And one male goat as a sin offering, to make atonement for you.”
Numbers 28:23 “You must offer these in addition to the regular morning burnt offering.”
Numbers 28:24 “In this same way, you must offer all of these, for seven days, each day, as a sacrifice made by fire to the Lord, a pleasing aroma. This is in addition to the daily burnt offering and its drink offerings.”
Numbers 28:25 “And on the seventh day, there will be a sacred assembly, and you must not do any ordinary work.”
Numbers 28:26 “Also, on the day of the firstfruits, when you bring a new grain offering to the Lord after your weeks have passed, there will be a sacred assembly, and you must not do any ordinary work on it.”
Numbers 28:27 “You must offer a burnt offering that produces a pleasing aroma to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven perfect, year-old male lambs.”
Numbers 28:28 “And for their grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil, three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, and two-tenths of an ephah for the ram.”
Numbers 28:29 “And one-tenth of an ephah for each of the seven lambs.”
Numbers 28:30 “Also, one male goat, which is to be sacrificed as a sin offering, to make atonement for you.”
Numbers 28:31 “You must offer all of these, along with the perpetual burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offerings, making sure they are all perfect.”
Numbers 29:1 In the seventh month of the year, on the first day of that month, you shall have a holy festival. No work of any kind that makes you a servant of anyone but God shall be done on that day, because it is the Day of Trumpets, a day of loud blasts and shofar calls.

Numbers 29:40 And so Moses explained to the children of Israel everything that the Lord had commanded him to tell them.
Numbers 30:1 Moses then spoke to the leaders of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the directive which the Lord has commanded:"
Numbers 30:2 "If any man makes a vow to the Lord, or binds himself by a sworn oath, he must not break his promise. Instead, he must fulfill everything that he has spoken with his own mouth."
Numbers 30:3 "If any woman makes a vow to the Lord, and binds herself by an oath, while she is a young woman living in her father's household:"
Numbers 30:4 "If her father learns of the vow his daughter has made, and the oath by which she has bound herself, and he remains silent about it—then she will be held accountable for her vow, and she must carry out everything she has promised."
Numbers 30:5 "But if her father hears about it and immediately forbids it, then her vows and oaths will be invalid; she will not be bound by anything, because her father has forbidden it."
Numbers 30:6 "If a woman takes a husband, and she has made a vow, or has let something pass from her mouth by which she binds herself by an oath:"
Numbers 30:7 "If her husband, upon hearing it, remains silent and does not forbid it on the day he hears it, then the woman who made the vow will be held accountable for it; she must fulfill whatever she has promised."
Numbers 30:8 "But if, as soon as he hears it, her husband forbids it and invalidates her vow and the word that had come from her mouth, then the Lord will be merciful to her, and she will not be held accountable."
Numbers 30:9 "Any vow made by a widow or a divorced woman, whatever she has spoken from her mouth, will be binding and valid."
Numbers 30:10 "If a woman makes a vow while living in her husband's house, and binds herself with an oath:"
Numbers 30:11 "If her husband hears it, and remains silent, and does not forbid the promise, then she will be held accountable for her vow, and she must fulfill it."
Numbers 30:12 "But if, upon hearing it, her husband immediately invalidates her vows and the words by which she had bound her soul, then they will be void; and the Lord will be merciful to her, so she will not be bound."
Numbers 30:13 "All vows and oaths by which a woman has consecrated herself or bound her soul will be subject to her husband's decision, whether they are to be valid or invalidated."
Numbers 30:14 "If her husband hears it, and remains silent, and postpones action until the next day, then the woman's vows will be binding, and she must fulfill her oaths. This is because he heard them and remained silent."
Numbers 30:15 "But if he immediately forbids it, he will invalidate her vows, and the words spoken from her lips, and the oaths by which she had bound her soul. Then the Lord will be merciful to her, and she will be free from the obligation."
Numbers 30:16 "This is the law concerning vows, which the Lord established for Moses: defining the relationship between a husband and wife, and between a father and his daughter who is a young woman, still living in her father's household."
Numbers 31:1 The Lord God then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 31:2 "You must exact vengeance for the children of Israel against the Midianites. After you do this, you will die and join your ancestors."
Numbers 31:3 Immediately Moses spoke to the people, saying: "Arm men from among you for battle. They must go and execute the Lord's vengeance against Midian."
Numbers 31:4 "From each tribe of Israel, you will send a thousand men to war."
Numbers 31:5 So out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe were sent—twelve thousand in total, prepared for battle.
Numbers 31:6 Moses sent them with Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest. Phinehas carried the holy vessels and the trumpets for sounding the battle cry.
Numbers 31:7 When they had fought against Midian and conquered them, they killed all the male inhabitants.
Numbers 31:8 They also killed the kings of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—all five leaders of that nation. Additionally, they killed Balaam, the son of Beor, with the sword.
Numbers 31:9 The children of Israel captured their women and their little ones. They also took all their cattle, all their flocks, and everything they could possess, carrying away all the plunder.
Numbers 31:10 And they burned all the cities, villages, and fortified camps of Midian with fire.
Numbers 31:11 Then, dividing the spoils and everything they had captured—both people and animals—they brought them to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, to their camp in the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan River across from Jericho.
Numbers 31:12 Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the assembly went out to meet them.
Numbers 31:13 Moses became angry with the leaders of the army, the tribunes (commanders of a thousand men), and the centurions (commanders of a hundred men), who were returning from the war.
Numbers 31:14 He asked them: "Why have you kept all the women alive?"
Numbers 31:15 "These are the very women who, at Balaam’s instigation, deceived the children of Israel. They led you to betray the Lord in the matter of Peor, which resulted in twenty-three thousand men of the people being killed."
Numbers 31:16 "Therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every mother who has known a man by sleeping with him."
Numbers 31:17 "But keep all the young girls and all the women who have not known a man through sexual intercourse alive for yourselves."
Numbers 31:18 "Moreover, you must remain outside the camp for seven days. Whoever has killed a person or touched a dead body must purify himself on the third and seventh day."
Numbers 31:19 "You must also purify yourselves, along with all your plunder: clothing, articles made of skins, woven goats' hair, and anything made of wood."
Numbers 31:20 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 31:21 "This is the law of purification that the Lord has commanded."
Numbers 31:22 "Anything that is gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead—"
Numbers 31:23 "and everything that can endure fire—you must pass it through fire, and it will be made clean. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be purified with water."
Numbers 31:24 "And on the seventh day, you must wash your clothes, and then you will be clean. After that, you may enter the camp."
Numbers 31:25 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 31:26 "Separate the spoils—everything that has been captured, from people to livestock—and divide it into two parts. One part will go to those who went to war, and the other to the entire multitude of the people."
Numbers 31:27 "From the half belonging to the soldiers, you must take one out of every five hundred—from both people and from cattle, donkeys, and sheep."
Numbers 31:28 "This portion belongs to the Lord, taken from those who fought. You will give it to Eleazar the priest, because these are the Lord’s firstfruits (the first offerings)."
Numbers 31:29 "From the half belonging to the children of Israel—that is, from what pertains to the multitude and the rest of the people—you will take one out of every fifty, from both people and from cattle, donkeys, sheep, and all living creatures. You will give this portion to the Levites, who stand guard over the Lord's tabernacle."
Numbers 31:30 Moses and Eleazar did exactly as the Lord had commanded.
Numbers 31:31 The total plunder, apart from what each individual soldier took for himself, amounted to six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,
Numbers 31:32 seventy-two thousand cattle,
Numbers 31:33 sixty-one thousand donkeys,
Numbers 31:34 and thirty-two thousand human souls of the female sex, who had never lain with a man.
Numbers 31:35 The portion for those who had gone to war was thirty-three thousand seven hundred fifty sheep.
Numbers 31:36 From these, seventy-five sheep were designated as the Lord's portion.
Numbers 31:37 Of the cattle, there were thirty-six thousand, and from these, seventy-two were designated as the Lord's portion.
Numbers 31:38 Of the donkeys, there were thirty thousand five hundred, and from these, sixty-one were designated as the Lord's portion.
Numbers 31:39 Of the human souls, there were fifteen thousand one hundred, and from these, thirty-two were designated as the Lord's portion.
Numbers 31:40 And Moses gave to Eleazar the priest, to the Levites, and to the entire multitude of Israel, the divided portions just as the Lord had commanded.
Numbers 32:1 Now the descendants of Reuben and Gad owned an immense amount of livestock. When they saw the regions of Jazer and Gilead, they recognized that these lands were very suitable for their herds.
Numbers 32:2 So they came to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the assembly, and they spoke to them.
Numbers 32:3 They spoke concerning Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nemra, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sibmah, Nebo, and Beon.
Numbers 32:4 This is the land that the Lord conquered before the eyes of the assembly of Israel—it is a very fertile land for the pasturing of our immense herds.
Numbers 32:5 Therefore, we beg you: if we have found favor in your sight, please give this land to us, your servants, as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan River.
Numbers 32:6 Moses then said to the descendants of Gad and Reuben: 'Are your brothers going to war, while you yourselves remain here?'
Numbers 32:7 Why are you discouraging the minds of the other descendants of Israel, preventing them from daring to cross into the land that the Lord is about to give them?
Numbers 32:8 Your fathers did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to explore the promised land.
Numbers 32:9 When they went up as far as the Valley of Eshcol and surveyed the entire land, they turned away the hearts of the descendants of Israel, so that they would not enter the borders that the Lord had given them.
Numbers 32:10 Therefore, the Lord became angry and swore an oath, saying:
Numbers 32:11 Surely none of these men of this evil generation will see the land that I solemnly promised by oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—because they refused to follow Me completely.
Numbers 32:12 Except for Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua, the son of Nun; only these two completely fulfilled the command of the Lord.
Numbers 32:13 And so, the Lord's anger burned against Israel. He made them wander for thirty-eight years through the desert, until that entire generation who had done evil in His sight had completely perished.
Numbers 32:14 And look, you have now followed in your fathers' footsteps, a new generation of sinful men, only to further increase the Lord's burning fury against Israel.
Numbers 32:15 For if you refuse to follow Him, He will abandon us all again in this desert, and you will bring ruin upon this entire people.
Numbers 32:16 But they came closer and said to Moses: 'We will only build sheepfolds for our immense herds and construct walled cities for our little ones and our families.'
Numbers 32:17 But we ourselves will arm ourselves and go forward, prepared for battle, before the other descendants of Israel. We will lead them into their allotted places. We will leave our children and our families in fortified cities because of the ambushes of the inhabitants of this land.
Numbers 32:18 We will not return to our homes until all the other descendants of Israel have taken possession of their full inheritance.
Numbers 32:19 Furthermore, we will not ask for any additional land beyond the Jordan, because we already have our full possession here, on the eastern side of the river.
Numbers 32:20 Moses responded to them: 'If you truly do what you promise, and if you go forth, ready for battle, before the Lord, to fight—'
Numbers 32:21 '—And every armed man among you crosses the Jordan, until the Lord has completely overthrown His enemies—'
Numbers 32:22 '—and the land is subdued before you; then you may return. You will be held blameless before the Lord and before Israel. And you will truly possess these regions that you have chosen, by the Lord’s authority.'
Numbers 32:23 But if you do not do what you say, then without a doubt, you will be sinning against the Lord. And be assured: your sin will certainly find you out and catch you.
Numbers 32:24 Therefore, build your cities for your children and your families, and construct sheepfolds and stables for your immense herds. But most importantly, fulfill what you have promised.
Numbers 32:25 The descendants of Gad and Reuben responded to Moses: 'We, your servants, will do exactly as our lord commands.'
Numbers 32:26 Our children, our wives, our immense herds, and all our other livestock will remain in the cities of Gilead.
Numbers 32:27 But your servants, every one of us prepared for battle, will cross over before the Lord into the conflict, just as our lord has spoken.
Numbers 32:28 Moses therefore gave these instructions concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the chiefs of the family units within each tribe of Israel.
Numbers 32:29 He said: 'If the descendants of Gad and Reuben cross the Jordan with you, all of them prepared for battle, and if the land is subdued before you, then you are to give them the land of Gilead as their possession.'
Numbers 32:30 But if they are unwilling to cross the Jordan with you, armed for battle, into the land of Canaan, then they will forfeit their request for Gilead. Instead, they must then receive their portion among you, within the land of Canaan itself, just like the other tribes.
Numbers 32:31 The descendants of Gad and Reuben responded, saying: 'Just as the Lord has spoken to His servants through you, so we will do.'
Numbers 32:32 We will cross over, armed, to the land of Canaan. And only after we have helped to secure the possession for the other tribes beyond the Jordan, will we then return to our own possession on this side of the Jordan.
Numbers 32:33 So Moses gave to the descendants of Gad and Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan. This included all the land with its surrounding cities.
Numbers 32:34 And the descendants of Gad built or rebuilt the cities of Dibon, Ataroth, and Aroer.
Numbers 32:35 They also built Atroth-shophan, Jazer, and Jogbehah.
Numbers 32:36 They also built Beth-nimrah and Beth-haran as walled cities, and constructed sheepfolds for their immense herds.
Numbers 32:37 But the descendants of Reuben built or rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kiriathaim.
Numbers 32:38 They also rebuilt Nebo and Baal-meon, giving them new names, and they rebuilt Sibmah. They were assigning new names to all the cities they rebuilt or constructed.
Numbers 32:39 Furthermore, the descendants of Machir, the son of Manasseh, went into Gilead and devastated it, killing all the Amorite inhabitants who lived there.
Numbers 32:40 Therefore, Moses gave the region of Gilead to Machir, the son of Manasseh, and his descendants settled there.
Numbers 33:1 These are the stages of the journey for the sons of Israel.
They departed from Egypt, organized by their family groups and tribes,
under the leadership and guidance of Moses and Aaron.
Numbers 33:2 Moses recorded these stages of their journey, each one changing at the Lord’s command,
listing every encampment.
Numbers 33:3 They departed from Rameses in the first month.
It was the fifteenth day of that first month, on the day after the Passover observance,
while all the Egyptians watched.
Numbers 33:4 The Egyptians were busy burying their firstborn children,
whom the Lord had struck down throughout Egypt.
Through these judgments, the Lord had exacted vengeance upon their gods.
Numbers 33:5 Then the sons of Israel departed from Rameses
and set up camp in Succoth.
Numbers 33:6 From Succoth, they journeyed to Etham,
which is located at the very edge of the wilderness.
Numbers 33:7 Departing from there, they came and encamped before Pi-Hahiroth,
which faces Baal-Zephon,
and they set up their camp opposite Migdol.
Numbers 33:8 Journeying from Pi-Hahiroth,
they passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness.
They traveled for three days through the wilderness of Etham
and then encamped in Marah.
Numbers 33:9 From Marah, they came to Elim.
In Elim, there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees.
They then set up camp beside these waters.
Numbers 33:10 Departing from Elim,
they established their camp beside the Red Sea.
Numbers 33:11 From the Red Sea, they proceeded into the Wilderness of Sin.
Numbers 33:12 From the Wilderness of Sin,
they journeyed to Dophkah.
Numbers 33:13 From Dophkah,
they arrived at Alush.
Numbers 33:14 Departing from Alush, they traveled
and set up camp in Rephidim.
In this place, the people had no water to drink.
Numbers 33:15 From Rephidim, they journeyed into the Wilderness of Sinai.
Numbers 33:16 From the Wilderness of Sinai,
they came to Kibroth-Hattaavah, which means 'the graves of craving'.
Numbers 33:17 From Kibroth-Hattaavah,
they journeyed to Hazeroth.
Numbers 33:18 From Hazeroth,
they arrived at Rithmah.
Numbers 33:19 From Rithmah,
they journeyed to Rimmon-Perez.
Numbers 33:20 From Rimmon-Perez,
they arrived at Libnah.
Numbers 33:21 From Libnah,
they journeyed to Rissah.
Numbers 33:22 From Rissah,
they arrived at Kehelathah.
Numbers 33:23 From Kehelathah,
they journeyed to Mount Shepher.
Numbers 33:24 From Mount Shepher,
they arrived at Haradah.
Numbers 33:25 From Haradah,
they journeyed to Makheloth.
Numbers 33:26 From Makheloth,
they arrived at Tahath.
Numbers 33:27 From Tahath,
they journeyed to Terah.
Numbers 33:28 From Terah,
they arrived at Mithkah.
Numbers 33:29 From Mithkah,
they journeyed to Hashmonah.
Numbers 33:30 From Hashmonah,
they arrived at Moseroth.
Numbers 33:31 From Moseroth,
they journeyed to Bene-Jaakan.
Numbers 33:32 From Bene-Jaakan,
they arrived at Hor-Hagidgad.
Numbers 33:33 From Hor-Hagidgad,
they journeyed to Jotbathah.
Numbers 33:34 From Jotbathah,
they arrived at Ebronah.
Numbers 33:35 From Ebronah,
they journeyed to Ezion-Geber.
Numbers 33:36 From Ezion-Geber,
they journeyed to the Wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.
Numbers 33:37 From Kadesh,
they journeyed to Mount Hor, which is on the border of the land of Edom.
Numbers 33:38 When Aaron the priest ascended Mount Hor, as the Lord commanded,
it was in the thirty-ninth year after the sons of Israel’s departure from the land of Egypt,
in the fifth month, on the first day of that month.
Numbers 33:39 Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old,
and there, on that mountain, he died.
Numbers 33:40 The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negeb—the southern part of the land of Canaan—
had heard that the sons of Israel were approaching.
Numbers 34:1 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 34:2 Give a command to the children of Israel and say to them: 'When you enter the land of Chanaan, and it falls to you by lot as your possession, it will be marked by these specific boundaries:
Numbers 34:3 The southern part of the border will be marked out from the wilderness of Sin, which is opposite Edom. This border will extend along the width of the eastern Salt Sea, which is also known as the Dead Sea.
Numbers 34:4 The border will then curve around to the south, opposite the Ascent of Scorpions. It will pass into Senna, and reach Cadesbarne. From there, it will extend to the town named Adar and continue as far as Asemona.
Numbers 34:5 Finally, circling from Asemona, the border will follow the Brook of Egypt and will extend to the edge of the western sea.
Numbers 34:6 The western boundary will also extend from this sea all the way to the Great Sea—the Mediterranean Sea. This will be your coastline.
Numbers 34:7 Furthermore, the northern side will be defined from the Great Sea, all the way to Mount Altissimus.
Numbers 34:8 From Mount Altissimus, it will reach as far as Emath. From the borders of Emath, it will extend to Sedada.
Numbers 34:9 The borders will continue as far as Sephron and will reach the town of Enan. This will be your boundary on the northern side.
Numbers 34:10 From there, the borders will be directed towards the eastern side, from the town of Enan as far as Sephama.
Numbers 34:11 And from Sephama, they will descend to Rabla, opposite the spring. They will then reach as far as the eastern Sea of Cenereth, also known as the Sea of Galilee.
Numbers 34:12 The border will extend to the Jordan River and to the Salt Sea—the Dead Sea. This will be your land all around its borders.
Numbers 34:13 Moses then commanded the children of Israel, saying: 'This is the land that you will possess by lot, and which the Lord has commanded to be given to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Numbers 34:14 For the tribe of Ruben, according to its families, and the tribe of Gad, according to its clans, and also the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their portion of the land.
Numbers 34:15 This portion of land is beyond the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, on the eastern side.
Numbers 34:16 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 34:17 These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you: Eleazar the priest, and Josue, the son of Nun.
Numbers 34:18 A prince will also be appointed for each of the tribes.
Numbers 34:19 These are their names: For the tribe of Juda, Caleb, the son of Jephone.
Numbers 34:20 For the tribe of Simeon, Samuel, the son of Ammiud.
Numbers 34:21 For the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad, the son of Chaselon.
Numbers 34:22 For the tribe of Dan, Bocci, the son of Jogli.
Numbers 34:23 For the sons of Joseph, for the tribe of Manasseh, Haniel, the son of Ephod.
Numbers 34:24 For the tribe of Ephraim, Camuel, the son of Sephtan.
Numbers 34:25 For the tribe of Zabulon, Elisaphan, the son of Pharnach.
Numbers 34:26 For the tribe of Issachar, Phaltiel, the prince, the son of Ozan.
Numbers 34:27 For the tribe of Aser, Ahiud, the son of Salomi.
Numbers 34:28 For the tribe of Nephthali, Phedael, the son of Ammiud.
Numbers 34:29 These are the men whom the Lord commanded to distribute the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel.
Numbers 35:1 The Lord spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, saying:
Numbers 35:2 “Command the children of Israel that out of their inherited lands, they are to give the Levites cities to live in, along with their surrounding pasture lands.
Numbers 35:3 So that the Levites may dwell in these towns, and the pasture lands may be for their cattle and all their other livestock.
Numbers 35:4 These pasture lands, extending from the city walls outwards, are to reach one thousand paces in every direction.
Numbers 35:5 Therefore, they shall have one thousand paces to the east, one thousand to the south, one thousand to the west, and one thousand to the north, with the city located in the center.
Numbers 35:6 Among these cities that you will give to the Levites, six are to be designated as cities of refuge, where anyone who has killed another person may flee for safety. In addition to these six, you are to give them forty-two other cities.
Numbers 35:7 Thus, all the cities together, including their pasture lands, will total forty-eight.
Numbers 35:8 From the inherited lands of the children of Israel, you shall give these cities, taking more from the larger tribes and less from the smaller tribes, according to their possessions.
Numbers 35:9 The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:
Numbers 35:10 “Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: ‘When you have crossed the Jordan River into the land of Canaan,
Numbers 35:11 you shall designate certain cities to be cities of refuge, so that anyone who has unintentionally shed blood —that is, killed someone without intent— may flee to them for safety.
Numbers 35:12 These cities will be places of safety for you, so that the avenger of blood —the victim’s relative— does not pursue and kill the one who has caused the death before he has had the chance to stand trial before the assembly.
Numbers 35:13 Of these cities that you are to designate as cities of refuge, three are to be located east of the Jordan River, and three are to be located in the land of Canaan.
Numbers 35:14 These six cities of refuge will stand ready; anyone who has shed blood —even if unintentionally— may flee to them.
Numbers 35:15 Both the children of Israel, as well as any foreigners or temporary residents living among you, shall have access to these same places of refuge, so that anyone who has unintentionally shed blood may flee to them.
Numbers 35:16 If anyone strikes another person with an iron instrument, and the person who was struck dies, then the attacker is guilty of murder; the murderer himself must be put to death.
Numbers 35:17 If someone throws a stone, and it strikes a person and that person dies, then the thrower is guilty of murder; he must be put to death.
Numbers 35:18 If he strikes with a wooden object and that person dies, he is guilty of murder; he must be put to death.
Numbers 35:19 The avenger of blood —the victim’s relative— is to kill the murderer; as soon as he catches him, he is to execute him.
Numbers 35:20 If someone pushes another person out of hatred, or throws something at them with hostile intent—
Numbers 35:21 —or strikes him with a hostile hand, and that person dies, then the attacker is a murderer. The avenger of blood, as soon as he finds him, is to execute him.
Numbers 35:22 But if someone does any of these things by accident, not out of hatred, and without any hostile intent—
Numbers 35:23 —for example, if a person accidentally drops a stone that could kill someone, without intending to hit anyone, or without even seeing anyone there, and it falls upon someone who then dies:
Numbers 35:24 —if this happens by accident, and the person who caused the death was not an enemy of the deceased, nor did he intend any harm to him:
Numbers 35:25 Then the assembly shall judge the case. The person who caused the death, having been found innocent of intentional murder, will be protected from the avenger of blood. He must return to the city of refuge to which he had fled and must remain there until the death of the High Priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
Numbers 35:26 However, if the one who has fled to a city of refuge goes outside the boundaries of that city and its pasture lands,
Numbers 35:27 and the avenger of blood finds him outside the limits of the city of refuge, and kills him, the avenger will not be guilty of murder.
Numbers 35:28 For the one who caused the death must remain in the city of refuge until the death of the High Priest; only after the High Priest’s death may he return to his own inherited land and property.
Numbers 35:29 These regulations shall be a sacred and binding ordinance for you throughout all your generations and in all the places where you dwell.
Numbers 35:30 If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death only upon the testimony of two or three witnesses. No one is to be put to death on the testimony of a single witness alone.
Numbers 35:31 You shall not accept any ransom or payment from a person who is guilty of murder in exchange for his life; the murderer himself must be put to death immediately.
Numbers 35:32 Nor shall you accept any ransom to allow a person who has fled to a city of refuge to return to his home before the death of the High Priest.
Numbers 35:33 Do not pollute the land where you live with bloodshed. The land is polluted by blood, and it cannot be cleansed or atoned for except by the blood of the person who shed it.
Numbers 35:34 You must cleanse the land where you live from this pollution, for I, the Lord, will dwell among you. Indeed, I am the Lord, who makes His dwelling among the children of Israel.
Numbers 36:1 The chiefs of the Gilead families approached. These were the descendants of Machir, Manasseh’s son, from the lineage of Joseph’s sons. They spoke before Moses, and before the leaders of Israel, who were the heads of their families. They said:
Numbers 36:2 Our Lord, the Commander of all, the Lord, had commanded you to distribute the land by lot among the sons of Israel. He also commanded that you give to the daughters of Zelophehad, our kinsman, their father’s inherited land.
Numbers 36:3 Now, if these daughters marry anyone from a different tribe, then their inherited land will transfer to the tribe to which their new family belongs. This would reduce the amount of land allotted to our own tribe.
Numbers 36:4 Furthermore, when the Jubilee comes—that is, the fifty-fifth year of remission of debts and return of land—their inherited land will become permanently joined to the inheritance of that other tribe. It will permanently pass out of our possession and ownership.
Numbers 36:5 Moses responded to the sons of Israel according to the word of the Lord, saying: “The tribe of the sons of Joseph has spoken correctly in this matter.”
Numbers 36:6 This is the Lord’s decree, which He has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad. He said: “Let them marry whomever they wish, but only to a man from their own tribe and their own family lineage, not to a man from another tribe.”
Numbers 36:7 This is so that the inherited lands of the sons of Israel do not get mixed up or transferred from one tribe to another. Instead, each man should take a wife from his own clan and lineage.
Numbers 36:8 Any woman who receives inherited land as her possession must marry a man from within her own clan, so that the land does not transfer to another tribe, but remains with her ancestral tribe.
Numbers 36:9 This ensures that no inherited land is transferred from one tribe to another, but that each tribe keeps its own inherited possessions.
Numbers 36:10 Just as the Lord had commanded Moses, the daughters of Zelophehad did exactly that.
Numbers 36:11 So Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah—the daughters of Zelophehad—got married. They married their cousins on their father’s side.
Numbers 36:12 They married within the family clan of Manasseh, which was from the lineage of Joseph’s son. And so, their inherited land remained within the tribe and family clan of their father.
Numbers 36:13 These are the commands and legal decrees that the Lord commanded through Moses to the sons of Israel, in the plains of Moab, across the Jordan River, opposite Jericho.
Deuteronomy 1:1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all the people of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan River. They were in the wilderness, on the plain across from the Red Sea, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
Deuteronomy 1:2 It was an eleven-day journey from Mount Horeb, by way of Mount Seir, to Kadesh-barnea.
Deuteronomy 1:3 In the fortieth year after they left Egypt, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel everything that the Lord had commanded him to tell them.
Deuteronomy 1:4 This was after Moses had defeated Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, who lived in Astaroth and Edrei.
Deuteronomy 1:5 On the other side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain the Law, saying:
Deuteronomy 1:6 “The Lord our God spoke to us at Mount Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed on this mountain for long enough.
Deuteronomy 1:7 Turn around now, and set out for the mountain country of the Amorites, and for all their neighboring lands—the plains, the highlands, the lowlands, the Negev, and the seacoast—all the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great River Euphrates.
Deuteronomy 1:8 See, I have given this land to you. Go in now and take possession of it, the land that the Lord swore to your fathers—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—that He would give to them and to their descendants after them.’
Deuteronomy 1:9 “At that time, I spoke to you and said, ‘I cannot bear the burden of leading you by myself.
Deuteronomy 1:10 The Lord your God has multiplied your numbers, and today you are as many as the stars in the sky.
Deuteronomy 1:11 May the Lord God of your fathers increase your numbers a thousand times more, and bless you, just as He has promised you.
Deuteronomy 1:12 I alone am not able to bear the burden of your affairs, your heavy load, and your disputes.
Deuteronomy 1:13 Choose wise, discerning, and experienced men from each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’
Deuteronomy 1:14 You answered me then, ‘What you propose to do is good.’
Deuteronomy 1:15 So I took the wise and prominent men from your tribes and appointed them as leaders over you: commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and also officers for your tribes, to instruct you in all matters.
Deuteronomy 1:16 I then commanded your judges, saying, ‘Hear the cases between your people, and judge fairly between a man and his brother, or between a man and a foreigner.
Deuteronomy 1:17 You shall not show favoritism in judgment; you must hear both the small and the great equally, and you must not fear any man, for the judgment belongs to God. If any case is too difficult for you, you are to bring it to me, and I will hear it.’
Deuteronomy 1:18 I commanded you at that time concerning all the things you were to do.
Deuteronomy 1:19 So, after we left Horeb, we traveled through that vast and terrifying wilderness you yourselves saw, following the road to the mountain region of the Amorites, just as the Lord our God commanded us. When we reached Kadesh-barnea,
Deuteronomy 1:20 I said to you, ‘You have now arrived at the mountain region of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving to us.
Deuteronomy 1:21 Look, the Lord your God has given you this land. Go up and take possession of it, just as the Lord God of your fathers has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged by anything.’
Deuteronomy 1:22 But all of you came near me and said, ‘Let us send men ahead to scout the land for us and bring back a report about the route we should take and the cities we will encounter.’
Deuteronomy 1:23 This idea seemed good to me, so I selected twelve men from among you, one from each tribe.
Deuteronomy 1:24 They went up into the hill country and came to the Valley of Eshcol, where they explored the land.
Deuteronomy 1:25 They gathered some of the land’s fruit as proof of its richness and brought it back to us, saying, ‘The land the Lord our God is giving us is indeed good.’
Deuteronomy 1:26 But you refused to go up, and instead you rebelled against the command of the Lord our God.
Deuteronomy 1:27 You complained in your tents, saying, ‘The Lord must hate us! That is why He brought us out of the land of Egypt—to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.
Deuteronomy 1:28 Where are we supposed to go? Our fellow Israelites have filled our hearts with fear by saying, “The people there are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls reaching to the sky! And we even saw the Anakim, the giants, there!”’
Deuteronomy 1:29 Then I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified or afraid of them.
Deuteronomy 1:30 The Lord your God, who goes before you, will Himself fight for you, just as you saw Him do for you in Egypt.
Deuteronomy 1:31 And in the wilderness—where you yourselves saw—the Lord your God carried you, just as a father carries his son, all along the path you traveled until you reached this place.
Deuteronomy 1:32 Yet, despite all this, you still did not believe in the Lord your God,
Deuteronomy 1:33 who went ahead of you on your journey to find you a place to camp. He showed you the way to go by fire at night and by a pillar of cloud by day.
Deuteronomy 1:34 When the Lord heard the sound of your complaints, He became angry and swore an oath, saying:
Deuteronomy 1:35 ‘Not one of the men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,
Deuteronomy 1:36 except for Caleb, the son of Jephunneh. He alone shall see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has walked, because he has fully followed the Lord.’
Deuteronomy 1:37 Because of you, the Lord also became angry with me and said, ‘Even you, Moses, shall not enter there.
Deuteronomy 1:38 But Joshua, the son of Nun, your assistant, he will enter there in your place. Encourage him and strengthen him, for he is the one who will lead the people of Israel to inherit the land.
Deuteronomy 1:39 Also your little children, about whom you said they would become captives, and your children who today do not know the difference between good and evil—they are the ones who will enter the land. I will give the land to them, and they shall possess it.
Deuteronomy 1:40 But as for you, turn back now and travel into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.’
Deuteronomy 2:1 And we turned back, journeying into the wilderness by the way that leads to the Red Sea, as the Lord had commanded me. And we circled around Mount Seir for many days.
Deuteronomy 2:2 Then the Lord spoke to me: "You have circled this mountain long enough.
Deuteronomy 2:3 Now turn and go northward.
Deuteronomy 2:4 And give this command to the people, saying: 'You will be passing through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and they will be afraid of you. Be very careful,
Deuteronomy 2:5 do not provoke them to battle. For I will not give you any of their land, not even a foot of ground, because I have given Mount Seir as a possession to the descendants of Esau.
Deuteronomy 2:6 You must buy food from them with money to eat. And you must also buy water from them with money to drink.
Deuteronomy 2:7 For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has known your journey, how you have traveled through this great wilderness for forty years, and you have lacked nothing.'
Deuteronomy 2:8 So when we had passed through the territory of our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, by way of the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber, we then arrived at the wilderness of Moab.
Deuteronomy 2:9 Then the Lord said to me: "Do not treat the Moabites as enemies, nor provoke them to battle. For I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot."
Deuteronomy 2:10 (The Emim were the first inhabitants there, a great, powerful, and tall people, just like the Anakim.
Deuteronomy 2:11 Like the Anakim, they were also considered Rephaim, and the Moabites called them Emim.
Deuteronomy 2:12 The Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out, destroying them, and then settled in their place. This was just as Israel would do in the land of their own possession, which the Lord had given to them.)
Deuteronomy 2:13 Now then, get up and cross the Wadi Zered.
Deuteronomy 2:14 The time from when we departed Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years. This was the time until the entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, just as the Lord had sworn they would.
Deuteronomy 2:15 Indeed, the hand of the Lord was against them to eliminate them from the camp.
Deuteronomy 2:16 So after all the fighting men had perished, dying out from among the people,
Deuteronomy 2:17 the Lord spoke to me, saying:
Deuteronomy 2:18 "Today you are to cross the boundary of Moab, near the city named Ar.
Deuteronomy 2:19 And you will approach the Ammonites. Do not harass them nor provoke them to battle, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites as a possession, because I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.
Deuteronomy 2:20 (That land was also considered a land of giants. In ancient times, giants lived there, whom the Ammonites called Zamzummim,
Deuteronomy 2:21 a great, powerful, and tall people, like the Anakim. The Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites, and the Ammonites settled in their place.
Deuteronomy 2:22 This was just as He had done for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites before them and they took possession. This remains true to this very day.
Deuteronomy 2:23 As for the Avvim who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)
Deuteronomy 2:24 Get up now and cross the Wadi Arnon. Look, I have delivered Sihon, king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land into your hand. Begin to take possession, and engage in battle against him.
Deuteronomy 2:25 This very day, I will begin to put the dread and terror of you upon all the peoples who live under the sky. So that when they hear your name, they will tremble and be astonished, and feel anguish like a woman in labor.
Deuteronomy 2:26 So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying:
Deuteronomy 2:27 'Let me pass through your land. I will keep to the main road, not turning off to the right or to the left.
Deuteronomy 2:28 Sell us food for money, so we may eat. And give us water for money, so we may drink.
Deuteronomy 2:29 Only let us pass through, just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, and the Moabites who live in Ar, did for us,
Deuteronomy 2:30 until we cross the Jordan River and enter the land that the Lord our God is about to give us.'
Deuteronomy 2:31 But Sihon, king of Heshbon, refused to let us pass through. For the Lord your God had hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, so that he might be delivered into your hands, just as you see today.
Deuteronomy 2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy 2:33 And the Lord our God delivered him to us, and we struck him down, along with his sons and all his people.
Deuteronomy 2:34 At that time, we captured all his cities, and we utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of those cities—men, women, and children. We left no survivors.
Deuteronomy 2:35 Only the livestock we took as plunder, and the spoils from the cities we captured, were spared.
Deuteronomy 2:36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Wadi Arnon, and from the town that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a single village or city that could escape us.
Deuteronomy 2:37 The Lord our God delivered everything to us, except for the land of the Ammonites, which we did not approach. And all along the Wadi Jabbok, as well as the cities in the hill country, and all the places that the Lord our God had forbidden us to touch.
Deuteronomy 2:1 Then we turned back, and set out into the wilderness by the way that leads to the Red Sea, just as the Lord had told us. And we circled Mount Seir for many days.
Deuteronomy 2:2 And the Lord spoke to me, saying:
Deuteronomy 2:3 You have circled this mountain long enough. Now turn and go towards the north.
Deuteronomy 2:4 And command the people, saying: 'You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the sons of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you.'
Deuteronomy 2:5 Be very careful not to provoke them. For I will not give you any of their land, not even a single foot of ground, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his possession.
Deuteronomy 2:6 You shall buy food from them with money and eat it. You shall also buy water from them with money and drink it.
Deuteronomy 2:7 The Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your journey, how you have traveled through this great wilderness for forty years. You have lacked nothing.
Deuteronomy 2:8 So we passed by our brothers, the sons of Esau, who lived in Seir, by way of the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber. Then we came to the wilderness of Moab.
Deuteronomy 2:9 And the Lord said to me: 'Do not fight against the Moabites, nor engage in battle with them. For I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as their possession.'
Deuteronomy 2:10 The Emim once lived there, a people great and strong, and as tall as the Anakim.
Deuteronomy 2:11 Like the Anakim, they were also considered giants. The Moabites called them Emim.
Deuteronomy 2:12 The Horites previously lived in Seir. The sons of Esau drove them out and destroyed them, and lived in their place, just as Israel did in the land of their possession, which the Lord gave to them.
Deuteronomy 2:13 'Now rise up and cross over the Zered Brook.' So we crossed over the Zered Brook.
Deuteronomy 2:14 The time that we traveled from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Zered Brook was thirty-eight years. This was until the entire generation of fighting men from the camp had perished, just as the Lord had sworn.
Deuteronomy 2:15 Indeed, the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from among the camp.
Deuteronomy 2:16 So after all the fighting men had perished, dying in the camp,
Deuteronomy 2:17 the Lord spoke to me, saying:
Deuteronomy 2:18 'Today you are to pass through the territory of Moab, that is, the city named Ar.
Deuteronomy 2:19 And when you come near the Ammonites—the sons of Ammon—do not provoke them, nor engage in battle with them. For I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as their possession.'
Deuteronomy 2:20 That land was also considered a land of giants. Giants once lived there, whom the Ammonites called Zamzummim,
Deuteronomy 2:21 a people great and strong, and as tall as the Anakim. The Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites, and the Ammonites took their place and settled in their land.
Deuteronomy 2:22 Just as He had done for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites before them and gave their land to them, which they have possessed to this very day.
Deuteronomy 2:23 The Avvim also, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, were destroyed by the Caphtorim, who came out from Caphtor, and settled in their place.
Deuteronomy 2:24 'Rise up, and cross over the Arnon River. Behold, I have delivered Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and his land into your hand—meaning, I have given you victory over him. Begin to take possession and wage war against him.'
Deuteronomy 2:25 'Today I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon all the peoples who live under the entire sky. So that when they hear of your name, they will tremble and be in anguish like a woman in labor.'
Deuteronomy 2:26 So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon, the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying:
Deuteronomy 2:27 'Let me pass through your land. I will travel only along the main road. I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.'
Deuteronomy 2:28 'Sell us food for money, so we may eat. Sell us water for money, and so we will drink.'
Deuteronomy 2:29 'Only allow us passage through your land, just as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for us, until we cross the Jordan River and enter the land that the Lord our God is giving to us.'
Deuteronomy 2:30 But Sihon, the king of Heshbon, would not allow us passage. Because the Lord your God had made his spirit stubborn and hardened his heart—so that he would resist us—so that he might be delivered into your hand, as you see today.
Deuteronomy 2:31 And the Lord said to me: 'Behold, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land to you. Begin to take possession.'
Deuteronomy 2:32 Then Sihon came out against us with all his people for battle at Jahaz.
Deuteronomy 2:33 And the Lord our God delivered him to us. And we defeated him, his sons, and all his people.
Deuteronomy 2:34 We captured all his cities at that time, utterly destroying every city—men, women, and children. We left no survivors in them.
Deuteronomy 2:35 Except for the plunder we took and the livestock, we kept nothing from the spoils of the cities we captured for ourselves.
Deuteronomy 2:36 From Aroer, which is on the bank of the Arnon River, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was no village or city that could escape us. The Lord our God delivered them all to us.
Deuteronomy 2:37 Except for the land of the Ammonites, which we did not approach—that is, all along the Jabbok River, and the cities in the mountains, and all the places that the Lord our God had forbidden us to touch.
Deuteronomy 3:1 So we turned and went up the road towards Bashan. Og, the King of Bashan, came out to meet us, with all his army prepared for battle; they stood ready to fight at Edrei.
Deuteronomy 3:2 The Lord God then spoke to me, saying, 'Do not be afraid of him, for I have already delivered him, along with all his people and his entire land, into your hands. You will do to him exactly what you did to Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who ruled from Heshbon.'
Deuteronomy 3:3 So the Lord our God truly delivered Og, the king of Bashan, and his entire army into our hands. We utterly defeated him until no one was left alive.
Deuteronomy 3:4 At that specific time, we conquered all his cities. These were sixty walled cities, encompassing the whole region of Argob, which was part of Og's kingdom in Bashan.
Deuteronomy 3:5 All these cities were fortified, protected by very high walls, strong gates, and reinforcing bars, in addition to many, countless unwalled towns surrounding them.
Deuteronomy 3:6 And we completely wiped them out, just as we had done to Sihon, the king of Heshbon. We utterly destroyed every city, killing every man, woman, and child.
Deuteronomy 3:7 However, we took all the livestock and the spoils from the cities for ourselves.
Deuteronomy 3:8 So, at that time, we took the land from the two Amorite kings who were east of the Jordan River. This territory stretched from the Arnon Stream all the way to Mount Hermon,
Deuteronomy 3:9 Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians and Senir by the Amorites.
Deuteronomy 3:10 We took all the cities of the plain, and the entire regions of Gilead and Bashan, extending to Salcah and Edrei, which were royal cities in Og's kingdom of Bashan.
Deuteronomy 3:11 Truly, only Og, the king of Bashan, remained from the last of the giant races. His enormous iron bed was on display in Rabbath of the Ammonites. It measured nine cubits long and four cubits wide, according to the common measure of a man's cubit. (This means it was about 13.5 feet long and 6 feet wide, indicating his immense stature.)
Deuteronomy 3:12 At that specific time, we took possession of this land. It stretched from Aroer, which is located by the Arnon Stream, including half of the mountainous region of Gilead and its cities, all of which I assigned to the tribes of Reuben and Gad.
Deuteronomy 3:13 The remaining part of Gilead, and all of Bashan, which was Og's kingdom, I assigned to the half-tribe of Manasseh. This included the entire region of Argob. All of Bashan was known as the land of the Rephaim, or 'giants'.
Deuteronomy 3:14 Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took possession of the entire region of Argob, extending all the way to the borders of Geshur and Maacah. He renamed Bashan after himself, calling it Havoth Jair—meaning 'Jair's settlements'—a name it still bears today.
Deuteronomy 3:15 To Machir, I also gave the land of Gilead.
Deuteronomy 3:16 And to the tribes of Reuben and Gad, I gave a portion of the land of Gilead, extending as far as the Arnon Stream. This included the middle of the stream itself, acting as a boundary, and extended up to the Jabbok Stream, which marked the border of the Ammonites.
Deuteronomy 3:17 I also gave them the plain, the desert areas, the Arabah valley, and the Jordan River itself, including the region of Chinnereth, stretching all the way to the Sea of the Desert, which is the very salty Dead Sea. This eastern boundary extended to the foothills of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy 3:18 At that time, I gave you these instructions, saying: 'The Lord your God has given you this land as your inheritance. So, all you valiant warriors, arm yourselves and march ahead of your Israelite brothers.
Deuteronomy 3:19 Your wives, little children, and livestock—and I know you have many of them—can stay safely in the cities I have given you.
Deuteronomy 3:20 You must continue until the Lord grants peace and rest to your brothers, just as He has given it to you. This means until they also take possession of the land that the Lord your God is about to give them on the other side of the Jordan River. Only then will each of you be free to return to the land and property I have given you.'
Deuteronomy 3:21 At that same time, I also instructed Joshua, saying: 'You have personally witnessed everything the Lord your God did to these two Amorite kings. He will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter.
Deuteronomy 3:22 Do not be afraid of them, because the Lord your God Himself will fight on your behalf.
Deuteronomy 3:23 At that moment, I also pleaded with the Lord, saying:
Deuteronomy 3:24 'Lord God, You are the One who began to reveal Your majesty and Your mighty power to Your servant. There is no other God in the universe, nor anywhere on the earth, who can perform the works You do, or display Your strength.
Deuteronomy 3:25 Please allow me to cross over and see this excellent land beyond the Jordan River, that magnificent mountain range, and the region of Lebanon.'
Deuteronomy 3:26 But the Lord was angry with me because of your transgressions, and He would not listen to my plea. He said to me:
Deuteronomy 3:27 'That is enough for you. Do not speak to me about this matter again.
Deuteronomy 3:28 Go up to the summit of Pisgah, and from there, look out with your own eyes towards the west, north, south, and east, and truly see the land. For you will not be crossing this Jordan River.
Deuteronomy 3:29 Instead, give instructions to Joshua. Strengthen him and encourage him, because he is the one who will lead this people, and he is the one who will divide the land that you are now seeing among them.' So we (the Israelites) remained settled in the valley directly opposite Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy 3:1 And we turned and went up the road to Bashan. And Og, the king of Bashan, came out against us—he and all his people—to fight us at Edrei.
Deuteronomy 3:2 And the Lord said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and all his land into your hand. You shall do to him just as you did to Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.'
Deuteronomy 3:3 So the Lord our God delivered Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people into our hands. We struck him down until not a single person remained alive.
Deuteronomy 3:4 At that time, we captured all of his cities—there wasn't a single town that escaped us. We took sixty cities, all the region of Argob, which was part of Og's kingdom in Bashan.
Deuteronomy 3:5 All these cities were fortified with very high walls, and strengthened with the most secure walls and gates, besides countless other towns that had no walls at all.
Deuteronomy 3:6 And we utterly destroyed them, just as we did to Sihon, the king of Heshbon. We completely destroyed every city, including the men, women, and little children.
Deuteronomy 3:7 However, we took all the plunder and livestock for ourselves.
Deuteronomy 3:8 At that time, we took the land of the two kings of the Amorites who were across the Jordan River, from the Arnon Torrent all the way to Mount Hermon.
Deuteronomy 3:9 The Sidonians call Mount Hermon 'Sirion,' but the Amorites call it 'Senir'.
Deuteronomy 3:10 We took all the cities of the plain, and all the land of Gilead and Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, which were cities of Og's kingdom in Bashan.
Deuteronomy 3:11 Only Og, the king of Bashan, remained of the remnant of the Rephaim giants. His sarcophagus can be seen in Rabbah of the Ammonites; it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide, measured by the standard cubit of a man's forearm.
Deuteronomy 3:12 At that time, we took possession of that land from Aroer, which is by the Arnon Torrent. I gave the middle part of the hill country of Gilead and its cities to the tribes of Reuben and Gad.
Deuteronomy 3:13 And the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, which was Og's kingdom, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, which included all the region of Argob. All of Bashan is called 'the land of the Rephaim' —the land of the giants.
Deuteronomy 3:14 Jair, a son of Manasseh, took possession of all the region of Argob, as far as the borders of Geshur and Maachah. He named Bashan, Avoth Jair —that is, 'The Villages of Jair'—after himself, a name that remains to this very day.
Deuteronomy 3:15 And to Machir I gave Gilead.
Deuteronomy 3:16 And to the tribes of Reuben and Gad I gave land from Gilead as far as the Arnon Torrent—the middle of the torrent serving as their boundary—and up to the Jabbok Torrent, which is the boundary of the Ammonites.
Deuteronomy 3:17 I also gave them the plain of the desert, and the Jordan River, and the borders of Chinnereth—which is the Sea of Galilee—as far as the Sea of the Arabah, which is the Salt Sea, or Dead Sea, eastward below the slopes of Pisgah.
Deuteronomy 3:18 At that time, I commanded you, saying: 'The Lord your God has given you this land to possess. All you strong men must arm yourselves and cross over before your Israelite brothers.'
Deuteronomy 3:19 But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock—which I know you have in great abundance—shall remain in the cities that I have given you.
Deuteronomy 3:20 You shall remain there until the Lord grants rest to your brothers, just as He has given it to you, and until they also possess the land that the Lord your God is about to give them across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his own possession, which I have given you.'
Deuteronomy 3:21 And to Joshua I commanded at that time, saying: 'Your own eyes have seen everything that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. So will He do to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross.'
Deuteronomy 3:22 'Do not fear them, for the Lord your God Himself will fight for you.'
Deuteronomy 3:23 At that time, I also pleaded with the Lord, saying:
Deuteronomy 3:24 'Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand! For there is no other God above You, in the universe and on earth, who can perform such works and powerful deeds like Yours.'
Deuteronomy 3:25 'Please let me cross over and see this good land beyond the Jordan, and this excellent mountain, and Lebanon.'
Deuteronomy 3:26 But the Lord was angry with me because of you, and He did not listen to me. Instead, He answered, 'Enough for you! Do not speak to Me any further about this matter.'
Deuteronomy 3:27 'Go up to the top of Pisgah, and look around with your eyes to the west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and see it! For you shall not cross this Jordan River.'
Deuteronomy 3:28 'But command Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him, because he himself shall go before this people, and he shall distribute to them the land that you are about to see.'
Deuteronomy 3:29 So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.
Deuteronomy 4:1 And now, Israel, listen carefully to the commands and judgments which I am teaching you today. Obey them, so that you may live and enter and take possession of the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, is about to give you.
Deuteronomy 4:2 You shall not add anything to the word which I speak to you, nor shall you take anything away from it. Instead, you must keep the commands of the Lord your God, which I am giving to you.
Deuteronomy 4:3 Your own eyes have seen what the Lord did against Baal-Peor, where the Israelites worshipped pagan gods. The Lord destroyed all the men who followed those false gods, removing them from your midst.
Deuteronomy 4:4 But you, who clung faithfully to the Lord your God, are all alive to this very day.
Deuteronomy 4:5 Behold, I have taught you commands and judgments, just as the Lord my God commanded me to do. My purpose is for you to follow these laws in the land which you are about to enter and possess.
Deuteronomy 4:6 Therefore, keep these laws and fulfill them. For this will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of all the surrounding nations. When they hear all these commands, they will declare, 'This truly is a wise and understanding people; a great nation!'
Deuteronomy 4:7 There is no nation so great that has gods drawing so near to it, as the Lord our God is present to all who call upon Him with sincere hearts.
Deuteronomy 4:8 And what other nation is so renowned and glorious, that it has such ceremonies, just judgments, and an entire body of law like the one I am setting before you today?
Deuteronomy 4:9 Therefore, guard yourself and your soul diligently. Do not forget the words that your own eyes have witnessed, and do not let them fade from your heart throughout all the days of your life. You must teach them to your children and to your grandchildren—that is, the generations to come.
Deuteronomy 4:10 Remember the day when you stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, Mount Sinai, when the Lord said to me: 'Gather the people to Me, so they may hear My words. In this way, they will learn to reverence and obey Me all the time that they live on the earth, and they will teach their children to do the same.'
Deuteronomy 4:11 And you approached the foot of that mountain, which burned with fire up to the visible sky. There was also deep darkness, thick clouds, and a dense mist upon it.
Deuteronomy 4:12 The Lord spoke to you from the midst of that fire. You heard the sound of His words clearly, but you did not see any physical form or likeness of Him.
Deuteronomy 4:13 And He declared His covenant to you, commanding you to keep the Ten Words—meaning the Ten Commandments. He then wrote them on two stone tablets.
Deuteronomy 4:14 The Lord also commanded me at that time to teach you the ceremonies and the judgments which you ought to perform in the land which you are about to possess.
Deuteronomy 4:15 Therefore, diligently guard your souls and pay close attention. Remember that you saw no likeness or image on the day when the Lord spoke with you in Horeb from the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy 4:16 Be careful, lest perhaps you be deceived and make for yourselves a carved likeness of anything: an image of a male or a female person.
Deuteronomy 4:17 Or a likeness of any beasts that are on the earth, or of any birds flying under the sky.
Deuteronomy 4:18 Or of any creeping things that move on the earth, or of any fish that dwell beneath the earth and in the waters.
Deuteronomy 4:19 Be careful also, lest perhaps, lifting your eyes to the sky, you see the sun, the moon, and all the stars of the sky—the entire host of heaven—and being deceived by error, you adore them and worship them. These are things which the Lord your God created for the service of all the nations that are under the sky; they are not to be worshipped.
Deuteronomy 4:20 But the Lord took you and led you out of the iron furnace of Egypt, a place of hard labor and oppression. He did this so that you might be for Him a people of inheritance—His very own possession—as you are on this present day.
Deuteronomy 4:21 The Lord also became angry with me because of your complaints and your words of rebellion. He swore that I would not cross the Jordan River, nor enter that excellent land which He is about to give you.
Deuteronomy 4:22 Behold, I will die in this land, and I will not cross the Jordan. But you will cross over and you will possess the land.
Deuteronomy 4:23 Beware lest you ever forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which He made with you. Do not make for yourselves a carved likeness of any of those things which the Lord has forbidden.
Deuteronomy 4:24 For the Lord your God is a consuming fire—He is passionate and severe against sin. He is a jealous God who will not tolerate idolatry.
Deuteronomy 4:25 If you beget children and grandchildren, and you remain for a long time in the land, and then, being deceived, you make for yourselves a carved likeness of anything, committing evil before the Lord your God, so as to provoke Him to anger—
Deuteronomy 4:26 I call the sky and the earth to witness against you today: you will quickly perish from the land which you are about to possess after crossing the Jordan. You will not remain in it for a very long time, but the Lord will stir you up and scatter you among all the nations.
Deuteronomy 4:27 And you will remain few in number among the nations to which the Lord will have led you into exile.
Deuteronomy 4:28 And there, in exile, you will serve gods made of wood and stone. These are idols that cannot see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell anything.
Deuteronomy 4:29 But if, when you are in exile, you seek the Lord your God, you will find Him. This will happen only if you seek Him with all your heart, and with all the tribulation and distress of your soul.
Deuteronomy 4:30 After all the things that we have spoken of above happen to you—after you experience these calamities—in the latter days you will return to the Lord your God, and you will listen to His voice.
Deuteronomy 4:31 Because the Lord your God is a merciful God, He will not abandon you, nor will He utterly destroy you. He will not forget the covenant which He swore to your fathers.
Deuteronomy 4:32 Inquire about the ancient days that were before you, from the day when God created mankind on the earth. Ask from one end of the sky to the other, if such a word as this has ever happened, or if such a thing has ever been heard?
Deuteronomy 4:33 Did any people ever hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of a fire, as you heard, and yet lived to tell of it?
Deuteronomy 4:34 Or has God ever attempted to go in and take for Himself a nation from the midst of other nations? He did this through trials, signs, and wonders, and by strong warfare, and an outstretched hand, and a high arm, and terrible visions—just as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, right before your very eyes.
Deuteronomy 4:35 All of this happened so that you might know that the Lord Himself is God, and that there is no other God besides Him.
Deuteronomy 4:36 From the sky above, He made you hear His voice, so that He might teach you. And on the earth, He showed you His great fire, and you heard His powerful voices from the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy 4:37 It was because He loved your fathers, and chose their offspring after them, that He led you out. He went before you with His great power from Egypt.
Deuteronomy 4:38 He did this to destroy nations greater and stronger than you as you entered their land. He brought you in and gave you their land as a possession, as you see on this present day.
Deuteronomy 4:39 Know therefore today, and consider in your heart, that the Lord Himself is God in the heavens above and on the earth below. There is truly no other God.
Deuteronomy 4:40 Therefore, keep His commands and precepts which I am giving to you today. This is so that it may be well with you and with your children after you, and that you may remain for a long time upon the land which the Lord your God is about to give you.
Deuteronomy 4:1 Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances that I am teaching you today. If you obey them, you will live, and you will enter and possess the land—the promised land—which the Lord God of your fathers is about to give to you.
Deuteronomy 4:2 You must not add to the word that I speak to you, nor take anything away from it. Instead, you must keep the commandments of the Lord your God, which I am commanding you today.
Deuteronomy 4:3 Your own eyes have seen everything that the Lord did against Baal-Peor. The Lord completely destroyed all of his worshipers from among you.
Deuteronomy 4:4 But you, who held fast to the Lord your God, all of you are still alive to this very day.
Deuteronomy 4:5 Look, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, just as the Lord my God commanded me. You are to obey them in the land that you are about to enter and possess.
Deuteronomy 4:6 Therefore, observe and perform them. For this will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations. When they hear all these statutes, they will say, 'Indeed, this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'
Deuteronomy 4:7 For there is no other great nation that has gods so near to them, as our God is near to all who call upon Him.
Deuteronomy 4:8 And what other nation has statutes, ceremonies, and ordinances that are as righteous as all these which I set before your eyes today?
Deuteronomy 4:9 Therefore, be careful and diligently guard your soul. Do not forget the words that your own eyes have seen, and do not let them depart from your heart all the days of your life. You are to teach them to your children and your grandchildren.
Deuteronomy 4:10 —especially on the day that you stood at Horeb before the Lord your God, when the Lord said to me, 'Gather the people to Me, so that they may hear My words. They are to learn to fear Me all the time that they live on the earth, and they are to teach their children.'
Deuteronomy 4:11 And you approached the base of the mountain, which was burning with fire up to the sky, surrounded by darkness, cloud, and deep gloom.
Deuteronomy 4:12 Then the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of His words, but you did not see any form or likeness.
Deuteronomy 4:13 And He declared to you His covenant—His ten words, the Ten Commandments—which He wrote on two tablets of stone.
Deuteronomy 4:14 And at that time, the Lord commanded me to teach you the ceremonies and ordinances that you were to perform in the land which you are about to possess.
Deuteronomy 4:15 Therefore, guard your souls very carefully. For you saw no form or likeness on the day when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy 4:16 Be careful that you are not deceived into making for yourselves any carved image, any likeness of any figure, whether male or female.
Deuteronomy 4:17 Be careful not to make any likeness of any animals that are on the earth, or of any birds that fly under the sky.
Deuteronomy 4:18 or of any creeping things that move on the ground, or of any fish that live in the waters beneath the earth.
Deuteronomy 4:19 And beware, lest you lift your eyes to the sky and see the sun and the moon and all the stars of the universe—all the celestial bodies—and be led astray by error to worship and serve them. For the Lord your God created these for the service of all the nations under the sky.
Deuteronomy 4:20 But the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt—a metaphor for severe oppression—so that you might be His inheritance, His own people, as you are this present day.
Deuteronomy 4:21 Furthermore, the Lord was angry with me because of your words, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan River, nor enter that excellent land which He is about to give to you.
Deuteronomy 4:22 But I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan. You yourselves will cross over and possess it.
Deuteronomy 4:23 Be careful not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which He made with you. And do not make for yourselves any carved image of anything that the Lord has commanded you not to make.
Deuteronomy 4:24 For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
Deuteronomy 4:25 If you beget children and grandchildren, and you remain a long time in the land, and then you are deceived into making for yourselves any carved image, committing evil in the sight of the Lord your God, so as to provoke Him to anger:
Deuteronomy 4:26 I call today the universe and the earth to witness against you. You will quickly perish from the land that you are about to possess after crossing the Jordan. You will not remain in it for a very long time, but you will be utterly destroyed and brought to nothing.
Deuteronomy 4:27 And the Lord will scatter you among all the nations, and you will remain few in number among the nations to which the Lord will lead you.
Deuteronomy 4:28 There you will serve gods made of wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
Deuteronomy 4:29 But if you seek the Lord your God there, you will find Him, provided that you search for Him with all your heart and with all the tribulation of your soul.
Deuteronomy 4:30 After all these things that have been foretold come upon you, in the last days you will return to the Lord your God, and you will listen to His voice.
Deuteronomy 4:31 For the Lord your God is a merciful God; He will not abandon you, nor will He utterly destroy you, nor will He forget the covenant which He swore to your fathers.
Deuteronomy 4:32 Indeed, inquire of the days of old, which were before you, from the day that God created mankind on the earth, from one end of the universe to the other. Has such a thing ever happened, or has anything similar ever been heard?
Deuteronomy 4:33 Has any people ever heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and remained alive?
Deuteronomy 4:34 Or has God ever attempted to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of other nations, by trials, by signs and wonders, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, just as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes?
Deuteronomy 4:35 This was so that you might know that the Lord Himself is God, and there is no other besides Him.
Deuteronomy 4:36 From the heavens, He made you hear His voice, so that He might teach you. And on the earth, He showed you His great fire, and you heard His voice from the midst of the fire.
Deuteronomy 4:37 Because He loved your fathers, and chose their descendants after them, He therefore brought you out, going before you with His great power, from Egypt.
Deuteronomy 4:38 He did this to destroy many nations, even those mightier than you, at your entrance. He brought you in and gave their land to you as a possession, as you see this present day.
Deuteronomy 4:39 Know therefore today, and consider in your heart, that the Lord Himself is God in the heavens above, and on the earth below, and there is no other.
Deuteronomy 4:40 Therefore, keep His statutes and His commandments, which I am commanding you today, so that it may be well with you and with your children after you, and that you may remain for a long time on the land which the Lord your God is about to give to you.
Deuteronomy 5:1 Moses then summoned all of Israel and said to them: 'Listen, O Israel, to the commandments and judgments which I am speaking in your hearing today; learn them and keep them through your actions.'
Deuteronomy 5:2 The Lord Our God made a covenant with us on Mount Horeb.
Deuteronomy 5:3 He did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, all of us who are alive here today.
Deuteronomy 5:4 Face to face He spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,
Deuteronomy 5:5 I stood between the Lord and you at that time, as a mediator and announcer of His words, to declare to you the word of the Lord; for you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.
Deuteronomy 5:6 I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
Deuteronomy 5:7 You shall not have other gods standing before Me.
Deuteronomy 5:8 You shall not make for yourself any carved image, nor any likeness of anything that is in the universe above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth.
Deuteronomy 5:9 You shall not adore them, nor shall you worship them; for I am the Lord your God, a jealous God, repaying the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, even to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me,
Deuteronomy 5:10 and showing mercy to thousands of those who love Me and keep My commandments.
Deuteronomy 5:11 You shall not use the name of the Lord your God in vain; for He will not leave unpunished anyone who takes His name for a useless purpose.
Deuteronomy 5:12 Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy, just as the Lord your God commanded you.
Deuteronomy 5:13 For six days you shall work and perform all your labor.
Deuteronomy 5:14 But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. On it you shall do no work, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your animals, nor the stranger who is within your gates; so that your male and female servants may rest just as you do.
Deuteronomy 5:15 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and that the Lord your God led you out from there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
Deuteronomy 5:16 Honor your father and your mother, just as the Lord your God commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may be well with you in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you.
Deuteronomy 5:17 You shall not murder.
Deuteronomy 5:18 You shall not commit adultery.
Deuteronomy 5:19 You shall not steal.
Deuteronomy 5:20 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
Deuteronomy 5:21 You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet his house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything else that belongs to him.
Deuteronomy 5:22 These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice, adding nothing more. And He wrote them on two stone tablets, which He then gave to me.
Deuteronomy 5:23 But when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, and saw the mountain burning, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders approached me.
Deuteronomy 5:24 And you said: 'Behold, the Lord our God has shown us His majesty and His greatness. We have heard His voice from the midst of the fire, and we have proven today that a person can live even when God speaks with them.'
Deuteronomy 5:25 'Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we will die!'
Deuteronomy 5:26 'For who is there among all flesh that has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have heard, and has been able to live?'
Deuteronomy 5:27 'You yourself, Moses, rather, go near and hear all that the Lord our God says to you, and then you speak to us; and we will listen and do them.'
Deuteronomy 5:28 When the Lord heard these words, He said to me: 'I have heard the voice of the words which this people have spoken to you; they have spoken everything well.'
Deuteronomy 5:29 'Oh, that they would have this mindset, to fear Me and keep all My commandments at all times, so that it may be well with them and their children forever!'
Deuteronomy 5:30 'Go and tell them: "Return to your tents."'
Deuteronomy 5:31 'But you, Moses, stand here with Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, and the ceremonies, and the judgments, which you shall teach them, so that they may perform them in the land which I am about to give to them as a possession.'
Deuteronomy 5:32 Therefore be diligent to keep and do what the Lord your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
Deuteronomy 5:33 Instead, you shall walk in the way which the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may have abundant success in possessing the land.
Deuteronomy 5:5:1 Moses called together all the people of Israel and said to them: "Listen, O Israel, to the statutes and ordinances that I am speaking for you to hear today, so that you may learn them and carry them out through your actions."
Deuteronomy 5:5:2 "The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb."
Deuteronomy 5:5:3 "He did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us—all of us who are still alive and present here today."
Deuteronomy 5:5:4 "He spoke with you face to face on the mountain, from the midst of the fire."
Deuteronomy 5:5:5 "I was standing as a mediator between the Lord and you at that time, to announce His words to you, for you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain."
Deuteronomy 5:5:6 "I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery."
Deuteronomy 5:5:7 "You shall have no other gods before Me."
Deuteronomy 5:5:8 "You shall not make for yourself a graven image, nor any likeness of anything that is in the sky above, or that is on the earth below, or that is in the waters beneath the earth."
Deuteronomy 5:5:9 "You shall not adore them, nor shall you worship them, for I am the Lord your God, a jealous God, who punishes the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me."
Deuteronomy 5:5:10 "And shows mercy to thousands of those who love Me and keep My precepts."
Deuteronomy 5:5:11 "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for neither shall he be unpunished who takes His name lightly or uses it for empty things."
Deuteronomy 5:5:12 "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you."
Deuteronomy 5:5:13 "For six days you shall labor and do all your work."
Deuteronomy 5:5:14 "But the seventh day is the Sabbath, that is, a day of rest for the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor the stranger who is within your gates, so that your male and female servant may rest as well as you."
Deuteronomy 5:5:15 "Remember that you also were a slave in Egypt, and the Lord your God led you out from there with a strong hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore, the Lord your God commanded you to observe the Sabbath day."
Deuteronomy 5:5:16 "Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, that you may live a long time, and that it may go well with you in the land which the Lord your God will give you."
Deuteronomy 5:5:17 "You shall not kill."
Deuteronomy 5:5:18 "You shall not commit adultery."
Deuteronomy 5:5:19 "You shall not steal."
Deuteronomy 5:5:20 "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."
Deuteronomy 5:5:21 "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet his house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, nor anything that belongs to him."
Deuteronomy 5:5:22 "These are the words which the Lord spoke to all your assembly on the mountain, from the midst of the fire, and the cloud, and the darkness, with a great voice, and He added nothing more. And He wrote these ten commandments on two stone tablets and delivered them to me."
Deuteronomy 5:5:23 "Now, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, and saw the mountain burning, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders approached me and said:"
Deuteronomy 5:5:24 "Behold, the Lord our God has shown us His majesty and greatness. We have heard His voice from the midst of the fire, and we have seen today that a man can live even when God speaks with him."
Deuteronomy 5:5:25 "Now therefore, why should we die, and why should this great fire consume us? For if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, we shall die."
Deuteronomy 5:5:26 "For what flesh is there, that has heard the voice of the living God from the midst of the fire, as we have heard it, and could live?"
Deuteronomy 5:5:27 "You, Moses, go near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say, and then speak to us; we will hear and we will do it."
Deuteronomy 5:5:28 "And when the Lord heard these words, He said to me: 'I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They have spoken well in all that they have said.'"
Deuteronomy 5:5:29 "'Who will grant them this mind, that they may fear Me, and keep all My commandments at all times, so that it may go well with them and with their children forever?'"
Deuteronomy 5:5:30 "Go, and tell them: 'Return to your tents.'"
Deuteronomy 5:5:31 "But you, Moses, stand here by Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, so that they may observe them in the land that I am giving them as a possession."
Deuteronomy 5:5:32 "Therefore, be careful to do exactly as the Lord your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left."
Deuteronomy 5:5:33 "But you shall walk in the way which the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live and that it may go well with you, and that you may remain a long time in the land which you are going to possess."
Deuteronomy 6:1 These are the commands, and the ceremonies, and the laws
which the Lord your God has commanded me to teach you,
so that you may do them in the land which you are about to enter and possess.
Deuteronomy 6:2 This is so that you may fear the Lord your God
and keep all His commands and precepts which I give you today—
you, and your children, and your grandchildren—all the days of your life,
and so that your days may be long upon the land.
Deuteronomy 6:3 Hear, O Israel, and be careful to do them,
so that it may be well with you, and that you may multiply greatly,
just as the Lord God of your fathers has promised you a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy 6:4 Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
Deuteronomy 6:5 You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength.
Deuteronomy 6:6 And these words, which I command you today, shall be in your heart.
Deuteronomy 6:7 You shall tell them to your children
and you shall meditate on them when you sit in your house, and when you walk on the road,
and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
Deuteronomy 6:8 You shall bind them as a sign on your hand,
and they shall be as frontlets [phylacteries] between your eyes.
Deuteronomy 6:9 And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
Deuteronomy 6:10 Therefore, when the Lord your God brings you into the land
concerning which He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
and He gives you great and good cities, which you did not build,
Deuteronomy 6:11 and houses full of all good things, which you did not furnish,
and cisterns which you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves, which you did not plant,
Deuteronomy 6:12 and you eat and are satisfied,
Deuteronomy 6:13 be careful lest you forget the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Deuteronomy 6:14 You shall fear the Lord your God; you shall serve Him, and swear by His Name.
Deuteronomy 6:15 You shall not go after other gods of any of the peoples who are around you.
Deuteronomy 6:16 For the Lord your God is a jealous God in your midst—
a God who demands your exclusive worship and fidelity—
lest the wrath of the Lord your God be kindled against you
and He destroy you from the face of the land.
Deuteronomy 6:17 You shall not put the Lord your God to the test, as you tested Him at Massah [the place of testing].
Deuteronomy 6:18 So that you may do what is pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord your God,
that it may be well with you, and that you may enter and possess the good land, concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers.
Deuteronomy 6:19 He will cast out all your enemies before you, just as He has promised.
Deuteronomy 6:20 When your son asks you in the future, saying:
"What do these testimonies, and these ceremonies, and these laws mean, which the Lord our God has commanded us?"
Deuteronomy 6:21 Then you shall say to him: "We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt,
and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Deuteronomy 6:22 And the Lord performed great and terrible signs and wonders in Egypt
against Pharaoh and all his household, before our very eyes.
Deuteronomy 6:23 And He brought us out from there, to bring us in, and to give us the land
concerning which He swore to our fathers.
Deuteronomy 6:24 And the Lord commanded us all these laws, so that we should fear the Lord our God,
for our good always, as it is today.
Deuteronomy 6:25 And He will be merciful to us if we are careful to observe and do all these commands
before the Lord our God, just as He has commanded us.
Deuteronomy 7:1 When you enter the land that the Lord your God will give you to possess, and He has destroyed many nations before you—the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites—these are seven nations much larger and stronger than you.
Deuteronomy 7:2 And the Lord your God has delivered them to you, and you have struck them down. You must utterly destroy them. You shall not make any treaty with them, nor show them any mercy.
Deuteronomy 7:3 Nor shall you join them through marriage. You shall not give your daughter to their son, nor shall you take their daughter for your son.
Deuteronomy 7:4 For they would turn your son away from following Me, and he would rather serve foreign gods. Then the Lord's anger will burn against you, and He will quickly destroy you.
Deuteronomy 7:5 Instead, you shall do this to them: you must tear down their altars, shatter their statues, cut down their sacred groves, and burn their carved idols with fire.
Deuteronomy 7:6 For you are a holy people to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be a special people for Himself, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy 7:7 It was not because you were greater in number than any other nation that the Lord joined Himself to you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples.
Deuteronomy 7:8 But it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath that He swore to your fathers that He brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 7:9 Know then that the Lord your God, He is God—a mighty and faithful God, who keeps His covenant and shows mercy to those who love Him and observe His commandments, to a thousand generations.
Deuteronomy 7:10 But He immediately repays those who hate Him by utterly destroying them, and He does not delay to repay the one who hates Him—He promptly gives him what he deserves.
Deuteronomy 7:11 Therefore, keep the commandments and the ceremonies, and the judgments that I am commanding you today to perform.
Deuteronomy 7:12 If you listen to these judgments and carefully observe and perform them, then the Lord your God will also keep for you the covenant and the mercy which He swore to your fathers.
Deuteronomy 7:13 And He will love you, and multiply you, and bless the fruit of your womb, and the fruit of your land—your grain, and your wine, your oil, and the increase of your cattle and the lambs of your flock in the land that He swore to your fathers to give you.
Deuteronomy 7:14 You will be blessed above all peoples. There will be no barrenness among you, neither male nor female, whether among your people or your livestock.
Deuteronomy 7:15 The Lord will remove from you every sickness, and He will not bring upon you any of the dreadful diseases of Egypt, which you know so well, but He will inflict them upon all your enemies.
Deuteronomy 7:16 And you shall devour all the peoples whom the Lord your God will deliver to you. Your eye shall not pity them, nor shall you serve their gods, for that would become a ruin for you—a snare.
Deuteronomy 7:17 If you should say in your heart: "These nations are more numerous than I am; how can I destroy them?"
Deuteronomy 7:18 Do not fear them, but remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all the Egyptians.
Deuteronomy 7:19 Remember the great plagues which your eyes saw, and the signs and wonders, and the strong hand, and the outstretched arm by which the Lord your God brought you out. So will the Lord do to all the peoples whom you fear.
Deuteronomy 7:20 Moreover, the Lord your God will send hornets among them, until all who remain and have hidden themselves from you in flight are destroyed to death.
Deuteronomy 7:21 You shall not fear them, because the Lord your God is in your midst—a great and terrible God.
Deuteronomy 7:22 He Himself will consume these nations before you little by little, and piece by piece. You will not be able to destroy them all at once, so that the beasts of the earth do not increase against you in great numbers.
Deuteronomy 7:23 And the Lord your God will deliver them into your sight and will destroy them with a great confusion until they are utterly wiped out.
Deuteronomy 7:24 He will deliver their kings into your hands, and you shall blot out their names from under the sky. No one will be able to resist you until you have crushed them.
Deuteronomy 7:25 You shall burn their carved images with fire. Do not covet the silver and gold that is on them, nor take anything from them for yourself, lest you be ensnared by it. For it is an abomination to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 7:26 And you shall not bring anything from an idol into your house, lest you become accursed like it. You shall utterly detest it as filth and abomination, and flee from it as defilement, for it is something dedicated to destruction.
Deuteronomy 8:1 null

Deuteronomy 8:19 null
Deuteronomy 8:null But if you forget the Lord your God, and follow other gods, and serve them, and worship them, then I solemnly warn you today that you will truly perish.
Deuteronomy 8:20 null
Deuteronomy 8:null Just as the nations that the Lord destroyed before you, so also will you perish if you are disobedient to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 8:1 All the commandments which I give to you today, you must keep and do, so that you may live and multiply. And you will enter and possess the land, which the Lord swore to your fathers.
Deuteronomy 8:2 And you will remember all the journey through which the Lord your God led you for forty years through the desert, so that He might humble you and test you. This was to reveal what was truly in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.
Deuteronomy 8:3 He humbled you with scarcity and gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had known. This was to show you that humanity does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.
Deuteronomy 8:4 Your clothing did not wear out at any time, and your sandals did not tear on your feet throughout those forty years.
Deuteronomy 8:5 So you must know that just as a father disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplined you.
Deuteronomy 8:6 You are to keep the commandments of the Lord your God, walk in His ways, and revere Him.
Deuteronomy 8:7 For the Lord your God will bring you into a good land—a land of flowing streams, springs, and deep waters that emerge from valleys and mountains.
Deuteronomy 8:8 A land of wheat, barley, and vineyards, where figs, pomegranates, and olives—from which oil is pressed—will grow.
Deuteronomy 8:9 A land of oil and honey, where you will eat your bread without any scarcity, and you will enjoy the abundance of all things, with no scarcity whatsoever.
Deuteronomy 8:10 So that you may eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God for the excellent land which He has given to you.
Deuteronomy 8:11 Be very careful never to forget the Lord your God and neglect His commandments, judgments, and ceremonies, which I command you today.
Deuteronomy 8:12 Lest after you have eaten and are satisfied, you build beautiful houses and settle in them—
Deuteronomy 8:13 and your flocks of sheep and herds of cattle have multiplied, and your abundance of silver, gold, and all possessions has grown—
Deuteronomy 8:14 and your heart becomes proud, causing you to forget the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
Deuteronomy 8:15 He led you through that great and terrible desert, where there were fiery serpents, scorpions, and vipers, and a land without water. He brought forth water for you from the hardest rock.
Deuteronomy 8:16 And He fed you with manna in the wilderness, which your fathers had not known. He sustained and tested you with these trials so that, in the end, He might show you His mercy.
Deuteronomy 8:17 You must not say in your heart, 'My own strength and the might of my hand have provided all these things for me.'
Deuteronomy 8:18 Instead, you must remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the strength to possess this land. He does this to fulfill His covenant, which He swore to your fathers, just as it is being fulfilled today.
Deuteronomy 8:19 But if you forget the Lord your God and follow foreign gods, serving and worshipping them, behold, I declare to you now that you will utterly perish.
Deuteronomy 8:20 Just as the Lord destroyed the nations when you entered their land, so you also will perish if you are disobedient to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 9:1 Listen, Israel: Today you will cross over the Jordan River. You are going to take possession of nations that are very great and strong, and their cities are huge, with walls built up to the sky.
Deuteronomy 9:2 You will encounter a great and towering people, the sons of Anak, whom you already know, and about whom you have heard it said: 'Who can stand against the sons of Anak?'
Deuteronomy 9:3 Understand this today: The Lord your God Himself will cross over before you, like a consuming fire. He will crush these nations, and He will destroy and overthrow them before your very eyes. He will quickly wipe them out, and you will drive them out swiftly.
Deuteronomy 9:4 Do not say in your heart, when the Lord your God has destroyed these nations before you, that He brought you in to possess this land because of your own righteousness. Instead, the Lord will destroy them as you enter the land because of the wickedness of those nations.
Deuteronomy 9:5 You are not entering to take possession of their lands because of your own righteousness or the uprightness of your heart. It is because those nations have sinned wickedly that He will destroy them as you enter. This is also so that He may fulfill His promise, which He swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Deuteronomy 9:6 Know, therefore, that the Lord your God is not giving you this excellent land to possess because of your own righteousness. This is because you are a stubborn people, hard-headed and unyielding.
Deuteronomy 9:7 Remember, and do not forget, how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived at this very place, you have always contended with the Lord, opposing His will.
Deuteronomy 9:8 For even at Horeb, you provoked Him to anger, and the Lord was so furious that He wanted to destroy you entirely.
Deuteronomy 9:9 This was when I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets—the tablets of the covenant that the Lord had made with you. I remained on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, during which I ate no bread and drank no water.
Deuteronomy 9:10 Then the Lord gave me two stone tablets, written with the very finger of God. These contained all the words He had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire, when the people were gathered together.
Deuteronomy 9:11 And when the forty days and forty nights had passed, the Lord gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
Deuteronomy 9:12 Then the Lord said to me: 'Get up and go down from here quickly, because your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have sinned. They have very quickly abandoned the way that I commanded them, and they have made a molten idol for themselves.'
Deuteronomy 9:13 And again, the Lord said to me: 'I see that this people is stubborn and unyielding.'
Deuteronomy 9:14 'Let me alone, so that I may crush them and erase their name from under the sky. Then I will make you into a nation much greater and stronger than this one is.'
Deuteronomy 9:15 So, as I came down from the mountain, which was burning fiercely, and held the two tablets of the covenant in my hands, I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God. You had made yourselves a molten calf, and you had quickly abandoned His way that He had shown you.
Deuteronomy 9:16 And I threw both tablets from my hands, shattering them before your very eyes.
Deuteronomy 9:17 Then I fell down and lay prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights. I ate no food and drank no water, because of all the sins you had committed, by which you had sinned against the Lord and provoked Him to wrath.
Deuteronomy 9:18 For I was afraid of His fierce anger and indignation, with which He was stirred up against you, wanting to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me on this occasion as well, and relented.
Deuteronomy 9:19 Even against Aaron, the Lord was intensely angry, wanting to destroy him. And I interceded for him also.
Deuteronomy 9:20 Also, at Taberah, and at Massah, and at the graves of craving, you provoked the Lord with your complaints and desires.
Deuteronomy 9:21 It was also when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: 'Go up and take possession of the land which I have given to you.' Yet you despised the command of the Lord your God, and you did not believe Him, nor were you willing to listen to His voice.
Deuteronomy 9:22 From the day you left Egypt until this very place, you have always been rebellious against the Lord.
Deuteronomy 9:23 And when the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea, saying, 'Go up and take possession of the land that I have given you,' you despised the command of the Lord your God. You did not believe Him, nor were you willing to listen to His voice.
Deuteronomy 9:24 Again, I fell down and lay prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights, just as I had previously, so that He would not destroy you.
Deuteronomy 9:25 And I prayed to the Lord, saying: 'O Lord God, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance, whom You redeemed in Your great power and led out of Egypt with a mighty hand.'
Deuteronomy 9:26 'Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not look upon the stubbornness of this people, nor their wickedness, nor their sin.'
Deuteronomy 9:27 'Otherwise, the inhabitants of the land from which You brought us out might say: 'The Lord was not able to bring them into the land He promised them, and He hated them; therefore, He led them out and killed them in the wilderness.''
Deuteronomy 9:28 'Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out with Your great strength and with Your outstretched arm.'
Deuteronomy 9:29 These are the words which the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.
Deuteronomy 9:1 Hear this, O Israel! You are about to cross the Jordan River this very day to dispossess nations far greater and stronger than yourselves, possessing immense cities with walls so fortified they seem to touch the very sky.
Deuteronomy 9:2 You will face a people of immense stature, dwelling behind high walls. These are the Anakim, whom you already know and have heard about, a lineage so mighty that no one, however strong, has ever been able to resist them.
Deuteronomy 9:3 Therefore, know this day that the Lord your God Himself will go before you. He is a consuming and devouring fire, and He Himself will utterly crush them and swiftly destroy them before your very eyes. You will drive them out and swiftly annihilate them, just as the Lord has promised you.
Deuteronomy 9:4 Do not say in your heart, once the Lord your God has destroyed them before you: 'It is because of my own righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to possess this land.' Understand instead that it is because of the wickedness of those nations that the Lord drives them out from before you.
Deuteronomy 9:5 For you are not entering to possess their land because of your own righteousness or the uprightness of your heart. Rather, it is because those nations acted wickedly, and also so that the Lord might fulfill His word, which He solemnly promised to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Deuteronomy 9:6 Know therefore that it is not because of your own righteousness that the Lord your God is giving you this excellent land as a possession, for you are truly a stiff-necked people, stubbornly resistant to His will.
Deuteronomy 9:7 Remember this and never forget how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the wilderness. From the very day you departed from Egypt until you reached this present place, you have continually contended against the Lord.
Deuteronomy 9:8 Indeed, even at Horeb you provoked the Lord to anger, and His wrath became so great that He intended to destroy you completely.
Deuteronomy 9:9 I recall when I ascended the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the very tablets of the covenant which the Lord had made with you. I remained on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, during which I neither ate bread nor drank water.
Deuteronomy 9:10 And the Lord gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God, containing all the words that He had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire, when He addressed the people directly.
Deuteronomy 9:11 And when the forty days and forty nights had passed, the Lord gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
Deuteronomy 9:12 Then the Lord said to me: 'Arise, and descend from here quickly, for your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have thoroughly corrupted themselves. They have swiftly departed from the path I commanded them, and they have made for themselves a molten idol.'
Deuteronomy 9:13 And again the Lord said to me: 'I perceive that this people is indeed stiff-necked and rebellious.'
Deuteronomy 9:14 'Leave Me alone now, that I may utterly crush them and blot out their name from under the entire sky. Then I will make you into a nation far greater and stronger than this one.'
Deuteronomy 9:15 So I turned and began to descend from the mountain, which was burning with fire, carrying the two tablets in my two hands.
Deuteronomy 9:16 And there I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made for yourselves a molten calf. You had swiftly departed from His way which He had clearly shown to you.
Deuteronomy 9:17 Therefore, I threw down the two tablets from my hands and shattered them before your very eyes, as a sign of the covenant you had broken.
Deuteronomy 9:18 Then I prostrated myself before the Lord, just as before, for forty days and forty nights, neither eating bread nor drinking water, all on account of your great sin—the sin by which you had offended the Lord and done evil in His sight, provoking His burning anger.
Deuteronomy 9:19 For I was terrified by the fierce anger and indignation with which He was enraged against you, and by His desire to utterly destroy you. Yet, the Lord listened to me even on this occasion.
Deuteronomy 9:20 The Lord was also exceedingly angry with Aaron, intending to destroy him. And I interceded for Aaron as well.
Deuteronomy 9:21 As for the heinous idol you had made—that calf—I burned it with fire, then ground it into small pieces, pulverizing it into dust. I then scattered this dust into the torrent that flowed down from the mountain.
Deuteronomy 9:22 Even at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you again provoked the Lord to anger with your incessant complaints and desires.
Deuteronomy 9:23 And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: 'Go up and take possession of the land which I have given to you,' you refused to go up. Instead, you were disobedient to the command of the Lord your God, showing disbelief in His word.
Deuteronomy 9:24 Indeed, you have been rebellious against the Lord from the very first day I began to know you.
Deuteronomy 9:25 And so, I lay prostrate before the Lord for forty days and forty nights, during which I continually pleaded with Him not to destroy you, just as He had threatened to do.
Deuteronomy 9:26 And as I prayed, I said: 'O Lord God, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance, whom You have redeemed by Your magnificent power, and whom You led out of Egypt with a mighty hand.'
Deuteronomy 9:27 'Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, nor their wickedness, nor their sin.'
Deuteronomy 9:28 'Otherwise, the inhabitants of the land from which You brought us out might say: "Because the Lord was unable to bring them into the land He promised them, and because He hated them, He led them out into the wilderness to kill them."
Deuteronomy 9:29 'Yet, they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out with Your great strength and Your outstretched arm.'

Deuteronomy 10:1 At that time, the Lord said to me: "Carve out two tablets of stone for yourself, just like the first ones were, and come up to me on the mountain; and you will also make a wooden ark."
Deuteronomy 10:2 "And I will write on these tablets the very same words that were on the first ones, which you broke; and you will place these new tablets in the ark."
Deuteronomy 10:3 So I made an ark from acacia wood, and I carved out two tablets of stone in the exact likeness of the first ones, and I went up onto the mountain, holding them in my hands.
Deuteronomy 10:4 And He wrote on these tablets, just as He had written before, the ten words—the Ten Commandments—which the Lord had spoken to all of you on the mountain from the midst of the fire when all the people were gathered; and then He gave these tablets to me.
Deuteronomy 10:5 And I, having returned from the mountain, placed the tablets in the ark which I had made, just as the Lord had commanded me; and those tablets have remained there in the ark to this very day.
Deuteronomy 10:6 Now the children of Israel moved their camp from Beeroth of the sons of Jaacan to Moserath; it was there that Aaron died and was buried. And Eleazar, his son, served in the priesthood in his place.
Deuteronomy 10:7 From there, departing from Moserath, they came to Gadgad; and from Gadgad they moved on to Jotbathah, a place known for its many waters.
Deuteronomy 10:8 At that very time, the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the Lord's covenant, and to stand before Him in dedicated service, and to bless the people in His name, a role that continues even to this present day.
Deuteronomy 10:9 Therefore, the tribe of Levi has no share or inheritance alongside their brothers, because the Lord Himself is their inheritance and possession, just as the Lord your God spoke to them.
Deuteronomy 10:10 And I, as before, stood on the mountain for forty days and forty nights; and the Lord heard my prayer even concerning this matter, and He did not wish to destroy you.
Deuteronomy 10:11 And the Lord then said to me: "Arise, and go before the people, so that they may enter and take possession of the land which I swore to their fathers I would give to them."
Deuteronomy 10:12 And now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you, but that you fear the Lord your God—meaning, hold Him in reverential awe—and walk in His ways, and love Him, and serve the Lord your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul?
Deuteronomy 10:13 What He asks is that you keep the commandments of the Lord and His ordinances, which I command you today, so that it may be well with you.
Deuteronomy 10:14 Behold, the Lord your God owns the entire universe, and the highest heavens beyond our comprehension, the earth, and everything that exists in it.
Deuteronomy 10:15 Yet, despite His infinite dominion, the Lord took delight in your fathers and loved them; and He chose their descendants after them—that is, all of you—from all the peoples of the earth, just as it is proven even to this very day.
Deuteronomy 10:16 Therefore, spiritually circumcise the foreskin of your heart, meaning, cut away all that is sinful and worldly, and do not stiffen your neck in stubbornness any longer.
Deuteronomy 10:17 Because the Lord your God, He alone is the God of all gods and the Lord of all lords, a great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God, who shows no partiality and takes no bribes.
Deuteronomy 10:18 He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and He loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing.
Deuteronomy 10:19 Therefore, you also must love strangers, because you yourselves were once strangers in the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 10:20 You shall fear the Lord your God, and you shall serve Him alone; you shall cling to Him, and you shall swear by His holy name.
Deuteronomy 10:21 He is your praise, and your God, who has done for you all these great and awe-inspiring things that your very eyes have seen.
Deuteronomy 10:22 Your fathers went down to Egypt with only seventy souls, and behold, now the Lord your God has multiplied you until you are as numerous as the stars of the universe.
Deuteronomy 10:1 At that time, the Lord said to me: 'Cut for yourself two stone tablets, just like the first ones you broke, and come up to me on the mountain. And then make a wooden ark, a special box to hold these new tablets.'
Deuteronomy 10:2 And I will write on these new tablets the same words that were on the first ones you shattered. Then, you will place these tablets inside the ark you made.
Deuteronomy 10:3 So I constructed the ark from acacia wood, and I carved two stone tablets, just like the original ones. Then, I ascended the mountain, carrying these two tablets with me.
Deuteronomy 10:4 And the Lord wrote on these tablets the ten sacred commands, exactly as He had written them the first time. These were the very words the Lord spoke to you on the mountain, from the heart of the fire, when all the people were gathered. And then He gave them to me.
Deuteronomy 10:5 Then, I descended from the mountain and returned to you. I placed the tablets inside the ark that I had made, and they have remained there to this very day, just as the Lord had commanded me.
Deuteronomy 10:6 Now, the sons of Israel moved their camp from Beeroth Bene Jaakan and came to Moserah. It was there that Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar took his place as priest.
Deuteronomy 10:7 From Moserah, they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah, they moved to Jotbathah, a land where there were streams and running water.
Deuteronomy 10:8 At that particular time, the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi. They were designated to carry the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to stand before Him in service, and to bless the people in His name, a role they continue to fulfill to this present day.
Deuteronomy 10:9 This is why the Levites did not receive a share of the land or an inheritance alongside their fellow tribes. For the Lord Himself is their inheritance and their portion, just as the Lord your God told them.
Deuteronomy 10:10 As for me, I stood on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, just as I had done before. And the Lord listened to my pleas even on this occasion, and He chose not to destroy you, the people.
Deuteronomy 10:11 Then the Lord said to me: 'Rise, and lead the people forward, so that they may enter and take possession of the land that I swore to give to their ancestors.'
Deuteronomy 10:12 And now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God truly ask of you? Is it not to revere the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to love Him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul?
Deuteronomy 10:13 What He asks is that you keep the commandments of the Lord and His ceremonies, which I am giving to you today, so that things may go well for you and you may prosper.
Deuteronomy 10:14 Behold, the Lord your God is the Creator and Owner of the sky, and even the highest heavens, the earth, and everything that exists within it. All belongs to Him.
Deuteronomy 10:15 Nevertheless, the Lord desired to bind Himself to your ancestors and He loved them. And He chose their descendants after them—that is, you—from all the nations, as is clearly evident today.
Deuteronomy 10:16 Therefore, circumcise the foreskin of your heart, meaning, cut away all spiritual impurities and harden your neck no longer against God’s will. Do not be stubborn.
Deuteronomy 10:17 For the Lord your God is indeed the God of all lesser gods, and the Lord of all earthly rulers. He is a great, mighty, and awe-inspiring God who shows no partiality and cannot be bribed.
Deuteronomy 10:18 He renders justice for the orphan and the widow. He loves the foreigner and provides him with food and clothing.
Deuteronomy 10:19 So you too must love foreigners, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 10:20 You shall revere the Lord your God, and Him alone you shall serve. To Him you shall hold fast, and by His name alone you shall swear your oaths.
Deuteronomy 10:21 He is your praise and your God, the one who performed these great and awesome deeds for you, which your own eyes have witnessed.
Deuteronomy 10:22 Your ancestors went down into Egypt with only seventy people. But now, behold, the Lord your God has multiplied you until you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.
Deuteronomy 10:23 I will not give further commandments concerning this among you now, because all your deeds are known to me, and all your thoughts are hidden from no one and known to me.
Deuteronomy 10:24 I will not speak further about this among you, for all your deeds are already accomplished and known, and all your thoughts are known to me and cannot be hidden.
Deuteronomy 10:25 If you devise any schemes against me, I will no longer tolerate this, and will not grant you any further reprieve.
Deuteronomy 10:26 I will grant you whatever you desire concerning this, provided that you are not against me.
Deuteronomy 10:27 Even if you sin, I will grant you forgiveness for this.
Deuteronomy 10:28 I will not grant you this, however, if you are stubborn and refuse to listen to my word.
Deuteronomy 10:29 I will not grant you this, if you are idolaters and worship false idols.
Deuteronomy 10:30 I will not grant you this, if you are blasphemous and lie under false oaths.
Deuteronomy 10:31 I will not grant you this, if you are impious and shed innocent blood.
Deuteronomy 10:32 I will not grant you this, if you are fornicators and commit adultery.
Deuteronomy 10:33 I will not grant you this, if you are greedy and acquire money unjustly.
Deuteronomy 10:34 I will not grant you this, if you are proud and despise your neighbor.
Deuteronomy 10:35 I will not grant you this, if you are envious and rejoice at the misfortunes of others.
Deuteronomy 10:36 I will not grant you this, if you are slanderers and secretly harm your neighbor.
Deuteronomy 10:37 I will not grant you this, if you are quick to anger and injure your neighbor in your wrath.
Deuteronomy 10:38 I will not grant you this, if you are contentious and cause harm to your neighbor in disputes.
Deuteronomy 10:39 I will not grant you this, if you are rebellious and rise up against me and against my law.
Deuteronomy 10:40 I will not grant you this, if you are faithless and do not believe in me and in my words.
Deuteronomy 11:1 Therefore, you will love the Lord your God, and keep His commandments, His rituals, His judgments, and His instructions at all times.
Deuteronomy 11:2 Understand today what your children did not know or experience, because they did not see the discipline of the Lord your God. They did not see His great deeds, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm—
Deuteronomy 11:3 —the signs and wonders He performed in the midst of Egypt against Pharaoh, its king, and against all of his land.
Deuteronomy 11:4 You also saw what He did to the Egyptian army, their horses, and their chariots: how He covered them with the waters of the Red Sea when they pursued you. The Lord destroyed them, and that destruction continues to this very day.
Deuteronomy 11:5 You saw what He did for you in the desert until you came to this very place.
Deuteronomy 11:6 And you saw what happened to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, who was the son of Reuben. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them with their households, their tents, and all their possessions that they had in the midst of Israel.
Deuteronomy 11:7 Your own eyes have seen all the great works that the Lord performed.
Deuteronomy 11:8 Therefore, keep all His commandments which I command you today, so that you may live, multiply, and go in to possess the land to which you are heading.
Deuteronomy 11:9 And you will live in it for many days—a land that the Lord promised with an oath to your fathers and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy 11:10 For the land you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you came. There, after sowing your seed, you had to irrigate it by foot, like a vegetable garden.
Deuteronomy 11:11 But this land is mountainous and has plains, and it relies on rain from the sky.
Deuteronomy 11:12 The Lord your God always watches over it, and His eyes are upon it from the beginning of the year to its end.
Deuteronomy 11:13 Therefore, if you obey My commandments which I command you today—that you love the Lord your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul—
Deuteronomy 11:14 —then I will give rain to your land at its proper time, both the early and the late rains, so that you may gather your grain, your wine, and your oil.
Deuteronomy 11:15 I will also provide grass in your fields for your livestock, so that you may eat and be satisfied.
Deuteronomy 11:16 Be careful, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn away from the Lord to serve foreign gods and worship them.
Deuteronomy 11:17 Otherwise, the Lord will be angry with you and shut up the sky, so that no rain will fall, and the earth will not yield its produce. Then you will quickly perish from the excellent land that the Lord is giving you.
Deuteronomy 11:18 Therefore, lay these words of mine in your hearts and in your souls. Tie them as a sign on your hands and place them between your eyes as a reminder.
Deuteronomy 11:19 Teach them to your children, that they may meditate on them when you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you rise up.
Deuteronomy 11:20 You shall also write them on the doorposts and gates of your house.
Deuteronomy 11:21 Do this so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, for as long as the sky stretches over the earth.
Deuteronomy 11:22 For if you carefully keep all these commandments that I am giving you today, and carry them out, so that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all His ways, and cling to Him—
Deuteronomy 11:23 —then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess them, even those nations that are larger and stronger than you.
Deuteronomy 11:24 Every place that your foot steps upon will be yours. Your territory will extend from the desert and Lebanon, from the River Euphrates to the western sea.
Deuteronomy 11:25 No one will be able to stand against you. The Lord your God will put the dread and fear of you upon all the land that you are about to tread upon, just as He promised you.
Deuteronomy 11:26 See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse.
Deuteronomy 11:27 The blessing will come if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy 11:28 The curse will come if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside from the way that I am showing you today, and follow other gods whom you have not known.
Deuteronomy 11:29 When the Lord your God brings you into the land that you are going to possess, you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
Deuteronomy 11:30 These mountains are across the Jordan, along the road that leads toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the plains opposite Gilgal, near the valley of Moreh which rises from the opposite side.
Deuteronomy 11:31 For you are about to cross the Jordan to take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving you. You will hold it and live in it.
Deuteronomy 11:32 Therefore, be careful to diligently observe all the rituals and judgments that I am setting before you today.
Deuteronomy 11:1 Therefore, you must love the Lord your God. You must also keep His commands, rituals, ordinances, and statutes at all times.
Deuteronomy 11:2 Understand this today: I am not speaking to your children, who have not known and have not seen the instruction of the Lord your God. They did not see His great deeds, His strong hand, and His outstretched arm.
Deuteronomy 11:3 They did not see the miracles and works He performed in the midst of Egypt against Pharaoh the king, and against all of his land.
Deuteronomy 11:4 They did not see what He did to the army of the Egyptians, to their horses and chariots. They did not see how the waters of the Red Sea covered them when they were pursuing you, and how the Lord utterly destroyed them, even to this present day.
Deuteronomy 11:5 They did not see what He did for you in the wilderness, until you came to this place.
Deuteronomy 11:6 They did not see what happened to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, who was the son of Reuben. They did not see how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, along with their tents and all their possessions which they had in the midst of Israel.
Deuteronomy 11:7 Indeed, your very own eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord which He performed.
Deuteronomy 11:8 Therefore, keep all the commands that I am giving you today, so that you may live and multiply. You will then enter and possess the land to which you are going.
Deuteronomy 11:9 This is so you may live long lives in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers and to their descendants to give them—a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy 11:10 For the land you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you came. In Egypt, you sowed your seed and watered the dry ground with your foot, like a garden that is irrigated by hand or foot-powered pumps.
Deuteronomy 11:11 But this land is mountainous and has level plains, and it relies on rain from the sky.
Deuteronomy 11:12 The Lord your God always watches over this land. His eyes are upon it from the beginning of the year to its very end.
Deuteronomy 11:13 Therefore, if you obey my commands that I am giving you today, so that you love the Lord your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,
Deuteronomy 11:14 then I will give rain to your land at its proper time—the early rain and the latter rain. This is so you may gather your grain, your wine, and your oil.
Deuteronomy 11:15 I will also provide green pasture in your fields, so that your livestock may eat and you yourselves may be satisfied.
Deuteronomy 11:16 Beware lest your heart be deceived and you turn away from the Lord. Do not serve foreign gods and worship them.
Deuteronomy 11:17 Otherwise, the Lord's anger will burn against you. He will close the sky so that no rain comes down, and the land will not yield its fruit. You will quickly perish from the excellent land which the Lord is about to give you.
Deuteronomy 11:18 Therefore, place these words of mine in your hearts and in your souls. Tie them as a sign on your hands for a constant reminder, and place them between your eyes as a visible token.
Deuteronomy 11:19 Teach them to your children, so that they may always ponder these words. Speak of them when you sit in your house, when you walk on the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.
Deuteronomy 11:20 Also, write them on the doorposts and on the gates of your house.
Deuteronomy 11:21 This is so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the sky hangs over the earth—which means forever.
Deuteronomy 11:22 For if you keep these commands that I am giving you and perform them, so that you love the Lord your God and walk in all His ways, holding fast to Him,
Deuteronomy 11:23 then the Lord will drive out all these nations before your presence. You will possess them, even though they are much greater and stronger than you.
Deuteronomy 11:24 Every place that your foot treads upon will be yours. Your boundaries will extend from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the great river Euphrates, even to the western sea—the Mediterranean.
Deuteronomy 11:25 No one will be able to stand against you. The Lord your God will put the dread and fear of you upon all the land that you are about to tread upon, just as He promised you.
Deuteronomy 11:26 I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse.
Deuteronomy 11:27 A blessing, if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy 11:28 But a curse, if you do not obey the commands of the Lord your God, and instead turn aside from the way that I am now showing you. This curse will come if you walk after foreign gods whom you do not know.
Deuteronomy 11:29 Therefore, when you enter the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, you shall pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
Deuteronomy 11:30 These mountains are beyond the Jordan, following the road that leads westward, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plains opposite Gilgal. This Gilgal is near the valley that extends far inward.
Deuteronomy 11:31 For you are about to cross the Jordan to possess the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and you will hold it.
Deuteronomy 11:32 Therefore, observe and fulfill all the rituals and ordinances that I am setting before you today.
Deuteronomy 12:1 These are the commandments, the regulations, and the rulings
which you must carefully observe in the land that the Lord God of your fathers is about to give you to possess—
for as long as you live on that land.
Deuteronomy 12:2 You must completely demolish every place where the nations you are about to dispossess have worshipped their false gods—
whether on high mountains, or on hills, or under every lush, leafy tree.
Deuteronomy 12:3 You must tear down their altars, and shatter their sacred statues.
Cut down their groves of false worship, and burn their idols with fire.
And completely erase the names of those gods from those places.
Deuteronomy 12:4 You must not worship the Lord your God in that manner.
Deuteronomy 12:5 Instead, you must go to the specific place that the Lord your God chooses from all your tribes
to establish His name there and to make His dwelling permanent—
that is the only place you must go to worship Him.
Deuteronomy 12:6 And in that place alone, you are to offer your burnt offerings and your sacrificial victims,
your tithes and the firstfruits of your labor,
your vowed offerings and your freewill offerings,
along with the firstborn of your cattle and your sheep.
Deuteronomy 12:7 And there, in the presence of the Lord your God, you are to eat your sacred meals and rejoice
in everything you have accomplished, you and your households,
for the Lord your God has blessed you in all these things.
Deuteronomy 12:8 You must not continue to do there—in the Promised Land—what we do here today in the wilderness,
where everyone does what seems right in his own eyes.
Deuteronomy 12:9 For up until this present time, you have not yet reached the place of rest
and the possession that the Lord your God is about to give you.
Deuteronomy 12:10 You will cross the Jordan River and settle in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you,
so that you may be at rest from all your enemies on every side.
Then you will live in that land without any fear.
Deuteronomy 12:11 And there will be one specific place that the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell permanently.
To that one place alone, you must bring everything I command you:
your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the firstfruits of your labor,
and whatever you have vowed to the Lord.
Deuteronomy 12:12 And you are to feast there before the Lord your God, you and your sons and daughters,
your male and female servants, and the Levites who live in your towns,
because the Levites have no other allotted portion or possession with you.
Deuteronomy 12:13 Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see fit.
Deuteronomy 12:14 Instead, you must offer your oblations only in the place that the Lord chooses in one of your tribes,
and there you must do everything I command you today.
Deuteronomy 12:15 However, if you find yourself hungry and wish to eat meat, you may eat as much as your soul desires,
in all your towns, except for those animals that are offered as sacrifices to the Lord—these you are permitted to eat.
Deuteronomy 12:16 Only, you must not consume the blood. Instead, you must pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy 12:17 You will not be allowed to eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain, wine, and oil,
nor the firstborn of your herds and flocks, nor anything you have vowed as an offering,
nor any freewill offering, nor the firstfruits of your labor.
Deuteronomy 12:18 Instead, you must eat these things before the Lord your God
in the place that the Lord your God chooses—you and your son and daughter, your male and female servant,
and the Levite who lives in your towns.
And you will rejoice and be refreshed before the Lord your God in all the work of your hands.
Deuteronomy 12:19 Be careful not to neglect the Levite throughout all the time you are living as a sojourner in your land.
Deuteronomy 12:20 When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, just as He has promised you,
and you desire to eat meat, because your soul longs for it,
Deuteronomy 12:21 and if the chosen place, where the Lord your God has placed His name, is too far away for you to bring your sacrifices to,
then you may slaughter any of your cattle or sheep that the Lord has given you, just as I have commanded you.
And you may eat the meat in your own towns, according to all that your soul desires.
Deuteronomy 12:22 You may eat it just as you would eat a gazelle or a deer; anyone, whether ritually clean or unclean,
may eat it together, freely.
Deuteronomy 12:23 Only be very careful not to eat the blood; for the blood is their life itself.
And for that reason, you must not consume the life of the meat.
Deuteronomy 12:24 Instead, you must pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy 12:25 If you do what is displeasing to the Lord, and what is evil in His sight,
it will go well for you and for your children after you.
Deuteronomy 12:26 Therefore, the holy things that you have consecrated and vowed to the Lord,
your assembly must take up, and you must come to the place that the Lord chooses.
Deuteronomy 12:27 And you are to offer your burnt offerings, both the meat and the blood, on the altar of the Lord your God.
As for the meat of your other sacrifices, it shall be slaughtered,
and its blood will be poured out upon the altar.
Deuteronomy 12:28 Observe and obey all these things that I command you today,
so that it may go well for you and for your children after you forever,
when you do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 12:29 When the Lord your God cuts off the nations before you, whom you are going in to dispossess,
and you have driven them out and settled in their land,
Deuteronomy 12:30 be careful that you are not ensnared by their ways, after they have been destroyed from before you.
Do not inquire about how they worshipped their gods, saying to yourself, 'I will do the same.'
Deuteronomy 12:31 You must not act in that manner toward the Lord your God.
For they have committed against their gods all the abominable practices that the Lord detests,
even burning their own sons and daughters in the fire as offerings.
Deuteronomy 12:32 Everything that I command you, that alone you must do for the Lord your God.
You must not add anything to it, nor take anything away from it.
Deuteronomy 12:1 These are the commands and the judgments that you must obey in the land that the Lord God of your ancestors is about to give you. You are to possess this land and live upon it for as long as you are able.
Deuteronomy 12:2 You must completely destroy all the places where the nations you are about to dispossess have worshipped their gods: on the highest mountains, on the hills, and under every leafy tree.
Deuteronomy 12:3 Tear down their altars, smash their idols, cut down their sacred groves, and burn their carved images with fire. You must erase the very names of their gods from those places.
Deuteronomy 12:4 You must not do anything like this to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 12:5 Instead, you must come to the specific place that the Lord your God will choose out of all your tribes, to establish His Name there and to dwell there.
Deuteronomy 12:6 There, you are to offer your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the firstfruits of your labor, your vowed offerings and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your cattle and your sheep.
Deuteronomy 12:7 And you will eat there in the presence of the Lord your God, and you will rejoice with all that you have accomplished, you and your households, for all the ways in which the Lord your God has blessed you.
Deuteronomy 12:8 You must not do there what we do here today, where each person does whatever seems right in their own eyes.
Deuteronomy 12:9 For up to the present time, you have not yet come to the rest and the possession of the land that the Lord your God is about to give you.
Deuteronomy 12:10 You will cross the Jordan River and dwell in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, so that you may find rest from all your enemies on every side and live without any fear.
Deuteronomy 12:11 In the place that the Lord your God will choose to establish His Name there, you are to bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and the firstfruits of your labor, and whatever you have vowed to the Lord.
Deuteronomy 12:12 And you will feast there before the Lord your God, you and your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who lives within your gates, because he has no portion or inheritance with you.
Deuteronomy 12:13 Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in every place you might see.
Deuteronomy 12:14 But only in the place that the Lord will choose in one of your tribes are you to offer your burnt offerings, and there you must do all that I command you.
Deuteronomy 12:15 Nevertheless, in every city you may slaughter and eat meat according to all the desire of your soul, from whatever the Lord your God has blessed you with, whether it is ritually clean or ritually unclean. You may eat it as you would a gazelle or a deer.
Deuteronomy 12:16 Only do not eat the blood; instead, you must pour it out upon the ground like water.
Deuteronomy 12:17 You will not be permitted to eat in your towns the tithe of your grain, or your wine, or your oil, nor the firstborn of your herds and your flocks, nor any of the offerings you have vowed, or your freewill offerings, or the firstfruits of your labor.
Deuteronomy 12:18 Instead, you must eat them before the Lord your God in the place that the Lord your God will choose: you, and your son, and your daughter, your male and female servants, and the Levite who dwells in your cities. And you will rejoice and be refreshed before the Lord your God in all that you accomplish.
Deuteronomy 12:19 Be careful not to neglect the Levite at any time while you are dwelling in your land.
Deuteronomy 12:20 When the Lord your God expands your territory, just as He promised you, and you desire to eat meat—whatever your soul longs for—you will then have the permission to slaughter and eat it according to the blessing of the Lord your God, and according to every desire of your soul.
Deuteronomy 12:21 If the place that the Lord your God has chosen to establish His Name there is too far away, you may slaughter from your herds and your flocks, which the Lord has given you, just as I have commanded you. You may eat it in your own cities, according to every desire of your soul.
Deuteronomy 12:22 You may eat from them just as you would eat a gazelle or a deer: both the ritually clean and the ritually unclean alike may partake.
Deuteronomy 12:23 Only be careful not to eat the blood, for the blood is their life, and therefore you must not eat the life with the meat.
Deuteronomy 12:24 You must not eat it, but you are to pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy 12:25 You must not eat it, so that it may go well with you and with your children after you, when you do what is pleasing before the Lord.
Deuteronomy 12:26 But your vowed offerings and your freewill offerings that you have made to the Lord, you must take and bring to the place that the Lord will choose.
Deuteronomy 12:27 There you will offer your burnt offerings—both the meat and the blood—upon the altar of the Lord your God. You will pour the blood of the sacrifices at the base of the altar, and lay the meat itself upon the altar.
Deuteronomy 12:28 Be diligent to observe and listen to all that I command you, so that it may always go well with you and with your children after you, when you do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 12:29 When the Lord your God has destroyed before you the nations into whose land you are going to possess, and you have driven them out and settled in their land,
Deuteronomy 12:30 Be careful not to imitate their customs after they have been scattered before you. Do not even inquire how they worshipped their gods, saying to yourself, 'Just as these nations worshipped their gods, so will I worship them too.'
Deuteronomy 12:31 You must not act in this way towards the Lord your God, for they have done to their gods all the abominable practices that the Lord detests, even offering their sons and daughters and burning them with fire.
Deuteronomy 12:32 Everything that I command you, this alone you must do for the Lord your God. You must neither add to it nor take away from it.
Deuteronomy 13:1 If a prophet, or someone who sees visions or has dreams, arises among you and declares a sign or a wonder to you,
Deuteronomy 13:2 and what he said actually happens, and then he says to you, "Let us go and follow other gods, gods you do not know, and let us serve them,"
Deuteronomy 13:3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. For the Lord your God is testing you, so that it may be clearly seen whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul, or not.
Deuteronomy 13:4 You must follow the Lord your God, and you must revere Him, and keep His commands. Listen to His voice, serve Him, and hold fast to Him.
Deuteronomy 13:5 But that prophet or dreamer, you must put him to death. Because he spoke words to turn you away from the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery. He sought to drive you from the way the Lord your God commanded you, and he would not let you hear God's commands. You must remove this evil from your midst.
Deuteronomy 13:6 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife who shares your bed, or your friend whom you love as your own soul, secretly tries to persuade you, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," gods whom neither you nor your fathers have known—
Deuteronomy 13:7 gods of the peoples who are around you, whether they are near or far, from one end of the earth to the other—
Deuteronomy 13:8 you must not agree with him, nor listen to him. Your eye must not show pity for him, you must not spare him, and you must not hide his sin.
Deuteronomy 13:9 Instead, you must immediately put him to death. Your hand shall be the first upon him to kill him, and afterward, the hands of all the people.
Deuteronomy 13:10 Stones shall cover him and bring about his death. This is because he wanted to draw you away from the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery.
Deuteronomy 13:11 So that all of Israel, hearing about this, may fear and never again do anything of this kind.
Deuteronomy 13:12 If you hear in one of your cities, which the Lord your God is giving you to inhabit, some people saying,
Deuteronomy 13:13 "Worthless men—literally 'sons of Belial'—have gone out from among you and have turned away the inhabitants of their city, saying, 'Let us go and serve other gods whom you have not known,'"
Deuteronomy 13:14 then you must inquire, investigate diligently, and ask about every detail with the utmost truthfulness. If it is certain, and the detestable act is proven true among you,
Deuteronomy 13:15 you must immediately strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, and you must utterly destroy it, and all that is in it, even its livestock.
Deuteronomy 13:16 And all the plunder of that city you shall gather into the middle of its open square and burn the city with all its goods as a complete offering to the Lord your God. It shall remain a perpetual mound of ruins and shall never be built again.
Deuteronomy 13:17 Let nothing of the cursed thing cling to your hand, so that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger and show you mercy, and multiply you as He swore to your fathers,
Deuteronomy 13:18 if you listen to the voice of the Lord your God and keep all His commandments which I command you today, to do what is right in the sight of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 14:1 You are truly children of the Lord your God. Therefore, you must not cut yourselves, nor must you shave your heads as a sign of mourning for the dead.
Deuteronomy 14:2 This is because you are a holy people, belonging to the Lord your God. The Lord chose you specifically to be His own treasured people, distinct from all other nations on the face of the earth.
Deuteronomy 14:3 You must not eat anything that is an abomination.
Deuteronomy 14:4 These are the animals you may eat: an ox, a sheep, and a goat.
Deuteronomy 14:5 Also, you may eat the deer, the roe deer, the wild ox, the tragelaphus (a type of mountain goat or antelope), the oryx, the giraffe, and the bison.
Deuteronomy 14:6 You may eat every animal that has a completely split hoof and that also chews the cud.
Deuteronomy 14:7 However, among those that chew the cud or have a split hoof, you must not eat these: the camel, the hare, and the hyrax. Although they chew the cud, their hooves are not fully divided, making them unclean for you.
Deuteronomy 14:8 Also, the pig is unclean for you. Though it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You must not eat their meat, and you must not touch their dead bodies.
Deuteronomy 14:9 From all the creatures that live in the water, you may eat these: anything that has both fins and scales.
Deuteronomy 14:10 But anything that does not have both fins and scales, you must not eat, because it is unclean.
Deuteronomy 14:11 You may eat all clean birds.
Deuteronomy 14:12 However, you must not eat these birds: the eagle, the griffon vulture, and the sea eagle.
Deuteronomy 14:13 Also the kite, and all kinds of vultures.
Deuteronomy 14:14 And every kind of raven.
Deuteronomy 14:15 Also the ostrich, the horned owl, the seagull, and every kind of hawk.
Deuteronomy 14:16 The little owl, the ibis, and the swan.
Deuteronomy 14:17 The night heron, the cormorant, and all kinds of raven.
Deuteronomy 14:18 Also the heron, and all kinds of plover, as well as the hoopoe and the bat.
Deuteronomy 14:19 Furthermore, every winged insect that also crawls on the ground will be unclean for you, and it must not be eaten.
Deuteronomy 14:20 You may eat anything that is clean.
Deuteronomy 14:21 You must not eat any animal that has died a natural death. You may give it to a foreigner who lives within your towns, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a non-Israelite. This is because you are a holy people, belonging to the Lord your God. Also, you must never boil a young goat in its mother's milk.
Deuteronomy 14:22 You must set aside a tithe—a tenth—of all the produce from your fields that grows each year in the land.
Deuteronomy 14:23 You must eat this tithe—your tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil, and the firstborn of your cattle and sheep—in the presence of the Lord your God, at the specific place He will choose for His Name to be invoked. This practice will teach you to revere the Lord your God at all times.
Deuteronomy 14:24 If the journey is too long for you, and the place the Lord your God has chosen is very far away, so that you cannot carry your tithe there—or if the distance makes it impractical to transport it directly—
Deuteronomy 14:25 then you may convert all of your tithes into money. Tie the silver or gold securely in your hand, and travel to the place the Lord your God has chosen.
Deuteronomy 14:26 With that money, you may buy whatever you desire: cattle, sheep, wine, or strong drink, or anything else your heart longs for. You are to eat and drink there in the presence of the Lord your God, and you and your entire household are to rejoice together.
Deuteronomy 14:27 Be sure not to neglect the Levite who lives within your towns, because he does not have an inherited portion or land ownership among you.
Deuteronomy 14:28 At the end of every three years, you must bring out the entire tithe of your produce from that year and store it within your towns.
Deuteronomy 14:29 Then the Levite, who has no inherited portion or land with you, and the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow who live within your towns, will come and eat until they are satisfied. Do this so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that you undertake.
Deuteronomy 14:1 You are children of the Lord your God, so you must not wound yourselves or shave your heads for the dead.
Deuteronomy 14:2 Because you are a holy people to the Lord your God, and He has chosen you to be His own special people from all the nations on earth.
Deuteronomy 14:3 Do not eat anything that is detestable.
Deuteronomy 14:4 These are the animals you are permitted to eat: an ox, a sheep, and a goat,
Deuteronomy 14:5 a stag, a gazelle, a roebuck, a wild goat, an ibex, a wild ox, and a chamois.
Deuteronomy 14:6 You may eat any animal that has a completely split hoof and chews the cud.
Deuteronomy 14:7 But among those that chew the cud or have a split hoof but not both, you must not eat these: the camel, the rabbit, and the rock badger, because they chew the cud but do not have a completely split hoof. They are unclean for you.
Deuteronomy 14:8 The pig is also unclean for you, because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud. You must not eat their meat or touch their dead bodies.
Deuteronomy 14:9 From all the creatures that live in the water, you may eat everything that has fins and scales.
Deuteronomy 14:10 But anything that does not have fins and scales you must not eat, because it is unclean for you.
Deuteronomy 14:11 You may eat all birds that are clean.
Deuteronomy 14:12 But these are the birds you must not eat: the eagle, the vulture, and the osprey,
Deuteronomy 14:13 the kite, the falcon, and any kind of buzzard or kite,
Deuteronomy 14:14 and any kind of raven,
Deuteronomy 14:15 the ostrich, the screech owl, the seagull, and any kind of hawk,
Deuteronomy 14:16 the little owl, the great owl, and the swan,
Deuteronomy 14:17 the pelican, the cormorant, and the purple heron,
Deuteronomy 14:18 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.
Deuteronomy 14:19 All winged insects that crawl on the ground are unclean for you and must not be eaten.
Deuteronomy 14:20 You may eat all other clean winged creatures.
Deuteronomy 14:21 Do not eat anything that dies naturally. You may give it to a foreigner living within your city gates to eat, or you may sell it to a non-Israelite, because you are a holy people to the Lord your God. You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.
Deuteronomy 14:22 You must set aside a tithe—one tenth—of all the produce that grows annually from your fields.
Deuteronomy 14:23 And you shall eat your tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil, and the firstborn of your cattle and sheep, in the presence of the Lord your God at the special place He chooses to make His name dwell there. You shall do this so that you may learn to revere the Lord your God always.
Deuteronomy 14:24 But if the journey is too far for you, and the special place the Lord your God chooses is too distant for you to carry your tithe, because the Lord your God has blessed you abundantly and the amount is too great,
Deuteronomy 14:25 then you may sell your produce, take the money with you, and go to the special place the Lord your God chooses.
Deuteronomy 14:26 With that money, you may buy anything you desire—cattle, sheep, wine, or strong drink—and you and your household shall eat and rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 14:27 And do not neglect the Levite who lives within your city gates, because he has no share or inheritance of land among you.
Deuteronomy 14:28 At the end of every third year, you must bring out the tithe—one tenth—of all your produce from that year and store it within your city gates.
Deuteronomy 14:29 Then the Levite, who has no share or inheritance of land among you, and the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow who live within your city gates, may come and eat and be satisfied. Do this so that the Lord your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to.
Deuteronomy 15:1 Every seven years, you must bring about a complete release of all debts—this is the Sabbatical year, for the forgiveness of debts.
Deuteronomy 15:2 And this is the specific rule for that debt release: Every creditor who has lent anything to his debtor must release it. He is not to demand repayment from his debtor, for it is the Lord's designated time for debt release.
Deuteronomy 15:3 You may demand payment from a foreigner and a sojourner, but from your own Hebrew kinsman and neighbor, you must not demand back what you have lent.
Deuteronomy 15:4 This is to happen, unless it so happens that there is no needy person among you—for the Lord your God will bless you abundantly in the land He is about to give you as your inheritance.
Deuteronomy 15:5 Provided, however, that you truly listen to the voice of the Lord your God and diligently keep all His commandments which I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy 15:6 Then the Lord your God will bless you, just as He promised. And you will lend money to many nations, but you yourself will not need to borrow from anyone; you will rule over many nations, but no one will rule over you.
Deuteronomy 15:7 If, however, there is ever a poor person among your kinsmen within any of your towns in the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you must not harden your heart or close your hand to him.
Deuteronomy 15:8 Instead, you must generously open your hand to him and lend him whatever he needs, according to his necessity.
Deuteronomy 15:9 Be careful that you do not secretly harbor any wicked thought and say in your heart: 'The seventh year, the year of debt release, is drawing near.' And then you turn your eyes away from the poor, and refuse to lend him anything. Beware that he does not cry out against you to the Lord, and it become a sin for you.
Deuteronomy 15:10 Instead, you must give to him; and do so without a grudging spirit, so that you may relieve him in his needs. For because of this very thing, the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything your hand undertakes.
Deuteronomy 15:11 For the poor will never cease to exist in your land. Therefore, I command you and say: You must open your hand generously to your brother, to the needy, and to the poor who live with you in the land.
Deuteronomy 15:12 If your Hebrew brother or sister sells himself or herself to you and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year, you must set them free.
Deuteronomy 15:13 And when you set them free, you must not send them away empty-handed.
Deuteronomy 15:14 Instead, you must provide generously for him from your flock, from your threshing floor, and from your winepress, with which the Lord your God has helped you.
Deuteronomy 15:15 Remember that you yourselves were also enslaved in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God delivered you. Therefore, I am giving you this commandment today.
Deuteronomy 15:16 But if they do not wish to leave, and answer, 'I will not leave, because I love you and your household, and I am content with you,' then this is what you must do.
Deuteronomy 15:17 You shall then take an awl and pierce their ear through the door of your house, and they will be your servant forever. You shall do the same for your female servant also.
Deuteronomy 15:18 Do not consider it a hardship to set them free from you, for they have served you for six years, having earned double the wages of a hired worker. And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.
Deuteronomy 15:19 All the firstborn males that are born from your herds and your flocks—whatever is male, you must consecrate to the Lord your God. You shall not put the firstborn calves to work, nor shall you shear the firstborn lambs.
Deuteronomy 15:20 You and your household shall eat them each year in the presence of the Lord your God, in the specific place that the Lord chooses.
Deuteronomy 15:21 But if the animal has a defect—if it is lame, or blind, or has any other serious blemish—you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 15:22 Instead, you may eat it within your own towns, both the ritually unclean and the clean among you, just as one would eat a gazelle or a deer.
Deuteronomy 15:23 You must only be careful not to eat their blood; instead, you must pour it out on the ground like water.
Deuteronomy 15:1 In the seventh year, you are to enact the year of release—this is the Sabbatical year for cancelling debts.
Deuteronomy 15:2 This is how the year of release is to be observed: Every creditor who has lent money to his neighbor must not demand its repayment from his fellow Israelite. This is because it is the Lord's designated year for releasing debts.
Deuteronomy 15:3 From a foreigner, you may still demand repayment. But from your fellow Israelite, you must not demand what is owed to you.
Deuteronomy 15:4 And there should be no poor among you—provided you fully obey the Lord your God, He will bless you in the land He is about to give you as your inheritance.
Deuteronomy 15:5 This will only happen if you truly listen to the voice of the Lord your God and diligently keep all His commandments that I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy 15:6 The Lord your God will truly bless you, just as He has promised. You will lend to many nations, but you yourselves will never need to borrow from anyone. You will rule over many nations, and no one will ever rule over you.
Deuteronomy 15:7 If one of your fellow Israelites living within the gates of your city—in the land the Lord your God is about to give you—becomes poor, you must not harden your heart or close your hand against the needy person.
Deuteronomy 15:8 Instead, you must open your hand generously to him and lend him whatever he needs to fully satisfy his needs.
Deuteronomy 15:9 Be careful that no evil thought creeps into your mind, leading you to say in your heart: 'The seventh year—the year of release—is approaching,' and then you turn your eyes away from your poor Israelite brother, unwilling to lend him anything. If you do this, he will cry out to the Lord against you, and it will be counted as a sin for you.
Deuteronomy 15:10 Instead, you must give to him, and do so cheerfully and without reluctance. Then the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you do with your hands.
Deuteronomy 15:11 For there will always be poor people in the land. That is why I am commanding you to open your hand generously to your needy Israelite brother and to the poor who dwell with you in the land.
Deuteronomy 15:12 If your fellow Hebrew man or woman sells himself or herself to you as a servant and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year, you must set them free.
Deuteronomy 15:13 When you set them free, you must not send them away empty-handed.
Deuteronomy 15:14 Instead, you must provide generously for them from your flock, from your threshing floor, and from your winepress—from all the ways the Lord your God has blessed you.
Deuteronomy 15:15 Remember that you yourselves were once slaves in Egypt, and the Lord your God freed you. That is why I am giving you this commandment today.
Deuteronomy 15:16 But if the servant says to you, 'I do not want to leave,' because he loves you and your household, and he is well off with you,
Deuteronomy 15:17 Then you must take an awl and pierce his ear through the door—this is a sign of his permanent commitment. He will then serve you for the remainder of his life. You must do the same for your female servant.
Deuteronomy 15:18 It should not seem burdensome to you when you set them free, because for six years they served you for twice the wage of a hired worker. If you follow these commands, the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do.
Deuteronomy 15:19 You must consecrate all the firstborn males born to your cattle and your flock to the Lord your God. You must not use the firstborn of your bulls for work, nor shear the firstborn of your sheep.
Deuteronomy 15:20 Each year, you and your household must eat them before the Lord your God in the special place that the Lord chooses for His worship.
Deuteronomy 15:21 However, if there is any blemish in the animal—if it is lame, or blind, or has any serious defect—you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 15:22 Instead, you may eat it within your own city gates, just as you would any other meat, whether it comes from a ritually clean or unclean animal.
Deuteronomy 15:23 Only be sure not to eat its blood, but pour it out on the ground like water, as a sign of respect for life.
Deuteronomy 16:1 Observe the month of fresh crops —the first month of the religious year, Abib— and celebrate the Passover solemnity to the Lord your God. For in this very month, the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
Deuteronomy 16:2 And you shall offer the Passover sacrifice to the Lord your God from your flocks and herds, in the sacred place which the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell.
Deuteronomy 16:3 You shall not eat anything leavened with it. For seven days, you shall eat unleavened bread —the bread of your affliction— because you came out of Egypt in haste. This is so you will remember the day you left the land of Egypt for all the days of your life.
Deuteronomy 16:4 No leaven shall be found in all your territory for seven days. And none of the meat that was sacrificed in the evening on the first day shall remain until morning.
Deuteronomy 16:5 You will not be permitted to sacrifice the Passover in just any of your cities that the Lord your God is giving to you.
Deuteronomy 16:6 Instead, in the special place that the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell, there you shall sacrifice the Passover in the evening at sunset, at the exact time you came out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 16:7 And you shall cook and eat it in the place which the Lord your God will choose. Then, in the morning, you shall return and go to your tents.
Deuteronomy 16:8 For six days, you shall eat unleavened bread. And on the seventh day, there shall be a solemn assembly for the Lord your God; you shall do no work.
Deuteronomy 16:9 You shall count seven weeks for yourself. From the day you first put the sickle to the standing grain, you shall count seven full weeks.
Deuteronomy 16:10 Then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the Lord your God, bringing a freewill offering from your hand, which you shall give according to the blessing that the Lord your God has bestowed upon you.
Deuteronomy 16:11 And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God: you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite who lives within your gates, and the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow who reside among you, in the place which the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell.
Deuteronomy 16:12 And remember that you were once a slave in Egypt. You shall therefore keep and do all the things that I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy 16:13 You shall celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles —the Festival of Booths— for seven days, when you have gathered in your produce from your threshing floor and your winepress.
Deuteronomy 16:14 And you shall rejoice in your feast: you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite, the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow who live within your gates.
Deuteronomy 16:15 For seven days you shall celebrate the feast for the Lord your God in the place which the Lord will choose. And the Lord your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be completely joyful.
Deuteronomy 16:16 Three times in a year, every male among you shall appear before the Lord your God in the place He will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Tabernacles. No one shall appear empty-handed in the presence of the Lord.
Deuteronomy 16:17 But each one shall offer what he has, according to the blessing of the Lord his God which He has given him.
Deuteronomy 16:18 You shall appoint judges and magistrates in all your gates —that is, in every town— which the Lord your God is giving you, throughout your tribes, so that they may judge the people with righteous judgment.
Deuteronomy 16:19 You shall not show partiality, nor accept bribes. For bribes blind the eyes of the wise and corrupt the words of the righteous.
Deuteronomy 16:20 You shall pursue justice, and only justice, so that you may live and possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy 16:21 You shall not plant any sacred tree or grove —used for idol worship— near the altar of the Lord your God, which you shall make for yourself.
Deuteronomy 16:22 Nor shall you erect any sacred pillar or idol, for the Lord your God detests these things.
Deuteronomy 16:1 Observe the month of Abib—the month of new things and the beginning of spring—and you shall celebrate the Passover in honor of the Lord your God, because in this very month of Abib, the Lord your God led you out of Egypt during the night.
Deuteronomy 16:2 Therefore, you shall offer the Passover sacrifice of sheep and oxen to the Lord your God in the specific place the Lord your God will choose for His name to reside there.
Deuteronomy 16:3 You shall not eat any leavened bread with it. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as has been commanded to you. This is the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in great haste. You shall do this so that you may remember the day of your departure from the land of Egypt all the days of your life.
Deuteronomy 16:4 No leaven shall be seen anywhere in all your territory for these seven days. Also, none of the flesh from what was sacrificed on the first evening shall remain until the next morning.
Deuteronomy 16:5 You will not be permitted to sacrifice the Passover lamb in just any of your cities that the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy 16:6 Instead, you must offer the Passover sacrifice in the specific place that the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell. There you shall sacrifice the Passover offering in the evening, at sunset, the very time you departed from Egypt.
Deuteronomy 16:7 You shall cook and eat it in the place the Lord your God will choose. Then, in the morning, you may return and go to your own tents or homes.
Deuteronomy 16:8 For six days you shall eat unleavened bread. But on the seventh day, because it is a solemn assembly for the Lord your God, you shall not do any work.
Deuteronomy 16:9 You shall count seven full weeks for yourself, beginning from the day you first put the sickle to the standing grain—from that day you shall count seven weeks.
Deuteronomy 16:10 Then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the Lord your God, offering a spontaneous gift from your hand, which you shall give to the Lord your God in proportion to the blessing He has given you.
Deuteronomy 16:11 And you shall feast before the Lord your God—you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite who lives within your gates, and the foreign resident, the orphan, and the widow who live with you—all in the place that the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell there.
Deuteronomy 16:12 And remember that you were once slaves in Egypt. Therefore, you shall carefully observe and do these specific commands.
Deuteronomy 16:13 You shall celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days, after you have gathered in the harvest from your threshing floor and your winepress.
Deuteronomy 16:14 You shall rejoice in your feast—you, your son, your daughter, your male and female servants, the Levite, the foreign resident, the orphan, and the widow who live within your gates.
Deuteronomy 16:15 For seven days you shall keep the feast for the Lord your God in the place the Lord will choose, because the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, so you will be entirely full of joy.
Deuteronomy 16:16 Three times a year, all your males shall appear before the Lord your God in the place He will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Tabernacles. No one shall appear empty-handed before the Lord.
Deuteronomy 16:17 Instead, each person shall offer what they are able to give, in proportion to the blessing that the Lord their God has bestowed upon them.
Deuteronomy 16:18 You shall appoint judges and officials in all your towns that the Lord your God is giving you, throughout all your tribes. These officials are to judge the people with righteous judgments.
Deuteronomy 16:19 They shall not be swayed to one side or another. You shall not show partiality to anyone, nor accept bribes, because bribes blind the eyes of the wise and corrupt the words of the righteous.
Deuteronomy 16:20 You shall wholeheartedly pursue only what is just and right, so that you may live and possess the land that the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy 16:21 You shall not plant any sacred pole or any tree of worship beside the altar of the Lord your God that you will build for yourself.
Deuteronomy 16:22 Nor shall you set up for yourself any sacred stone pillar, for these practices are detestable to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 17:1 You must not offer to the Lord your God any ox or sheep that has a blemish or any other defect. For such an offering is detestable to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 17:2 If there is found among you, in one of your cities that the Lord your God is giving you to dwell in, a man or a woman who does what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God and breaks His covenant with you—
Deuteronomy 17:3 by going and serving other gods and worshipping them—whether it be the sun, or the moon, or any of the celestial bodies in the sky—which I have not commanded you to do or to worship.
Deuteronomy 17:4 And if this is reported to you, and you hear of it, then you must inquire diligently into the matter. If it is found to be true, and such a detestable thing has indeed occurred within the land of Israel,
Deuteronomy 17:5 you shall bring out that man or that woman who has committed such an evil and wicked act to the gates of your city, and they shall be stoned to death with rocks.
Deuteronomy 17:6 At the testimony of two or three witnesses, the person who is to be put to death shall die; no one shall be executed on the testimony of a single witness against him.
Deuteronomy 17:7 The hands of the witnesses shall be the first to cast stones against him, in order to execute him, and afterward the hands of all the people. In this way, you shall purge this evil from among you and your community.
Deuteronomy 17:8 If you find that judgment is too difficult and ambiguous for you in a legal case—whether it be a dispute between blood and blood (concerning murder), or cause and cause (a legal claim), or leprosy and leprosy (a ritual purity question)—and you see that the words of judgment vary within your gates;
Deuteronomy 17:9 then you shall arise and go up to the specific place that the Lord your God will choose to establish His presence and authority.
Deuteronomy 17:10 You shall then come to the priests of the Levitical lineage and to the judge who is serving at that time. You shall inquire of them, and they will declare to you the truth of the judgment and the proper decision.
Deuteronomy 17:11 And you shall do whatever they tell you, those who preside over the place which the Lord has chosen, and whatever they teach you according to His law. You shall follow their judgment and not turn aside from their decision, neither to the right hand nor to the left.
Deuteronomy 17:12 But the person who acts with arrogance, refusing to obey the command of the priest who ministers there at that time before the Lord your God, or the judgment of the judge—that person shall die. You shall thus purge this evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy 17:13 And all the people who hear of it will be struck with fear, and they will never again act with such arrogance or disregard for authority.
Deuteronomy 17:14 When you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and you possess it and live in it, and then you say in your hearts: 'I will set a king over me, just as all the nations around me have kings'—
Deuteronomy 17:15 you may indeed appoint as king over you the one whom the Lord your God will choose from among your own brothers. You may not place a foreigner, who is not one of your own brothers, as king over you.
Deuteronomy 17:16 But once he is appointed, he must not acquire many horses for himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt to obtain more horses for his military strength—especially since the Lord has commanded you that you must never again return by that way to Egypt.
Deuteronomy 17:17 He must not acquire many wives for himself, lest they turn his heart away from God and His commandments. Nor must he accumulate for himself excessive amounts of silver and gold.
Deuteronomy 17:18 But after he takes his place on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law—this Book of Deuteronomy—in a scroll, taking the exemplar directly from the priests of the Levitical tribe.
Deuteronomy 17:19 He shall keep this copy with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the Lord his God and to carefully observe all the words and statutes of this law that are commanded in it.
Deuteronomy 17:20 In this way, his heart will not be lifted up in pride above his brothers, and he will not turn aside from these commandments, either to the right or to the left. This is so that he and his sons may reign for a long time over Israel.
Deuteronomy 17:1 You shall not sacrifice to the Lord your God any ox or sheep that has a blemish or any defect, because such an offering would be an abomination to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 17:2 If a man or woman is found among you, in any of your cities that the Lord your God is giving you, who does evil in the sight of the Lord your God, and has transgressed His covenant,
Deuteronomy 17:3 so that they go and serve other gods and worship them—whether the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of the sky—
Deuteronomy 17:4 and if this has been reported to you, and when you hear of it, you inquire diligently, and you find it to be true, and such an abomination has been committed in Israel,
Deuteronomy 17:5 then you shall bring out that man or woman who committed this wicked deed to the gates of your city, and they shall be stoned to death.
Deuteronomy 17:6 At the mouth of two or three witnesses, the one who is to be put to death shall die; no one shall be executed on the testimony of a single witness against them.
Deuteronomy 17:7 The hands of the witnesses shall be the first upon them to put them to death, and afterward the hands of all the people, so that you may remove the evil from your midst.
Deuteronomy 17:8 If you perceive that a judgment is too difficult and ambiguous for you—concerning matters of bloodshed, or legal cases, or leprosy cases—and you see that the words of the judges within your gates are varying,
Deuteronomy 17:9 then rise and go up to the place that the Lord your God will choose;
Deuteronomy 17:10 and you shall come to the Levitical priests and to the judge who will be in office at that time. You shall inquire of them, and they will declare to you the truth of the judgment.
Deuteronomy 17:11 And you shall do whatever they tell you, those who preside in the place that the Lord will choose, and whatever they teach you according to His law;
Deuteronomy 17:12 and you shall follow their ruling, and you shall not deviate from it to the right or to the left.
Deuteronomy 17:13 But if anyone acts presumptuously, unwilling to obey the command of the priest who ministers to the Lord your God at that time, or the ruling of the judge, that man shall die. So you shall remove the evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy 17:14 And all the people shall hear and fear, and never again shall they swell with pride.
Deuteronomy 17:15 When you have entered the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and have taken possession of it, and dwell in it, and you say, "I will set a king over me, just as all the nations around me have,"
Deuteronomy 17:16 you shall surely appoint as king over you the one whom the Lord your God will choose from among your brothers. You may not set a man of another nation over you as king, who is not your brother.
Deuteronomy 17:17 He shall not acquire many horses for himself, nor shall he lead the people back to Egypt to increase his cavalry, especially since the Lord has commanded you never to return by that way again.
Deuteronomy 17:18 He shall not have many wives, who might entice his heart away, nor shall he accumulate immense quantities of silver and gold.
Deuteronomy 17:19 And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall take a copy of this law, written for himself, from the Levitical priests;
Deuteronomy 17:20 he shall keep it with him and read it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear the Lord his God and diligently keep all the words and ceremonies of this law which are commanded.
Deuteronomy 18:1 The priests, the Levites, and all those from the tribe of Levi, will not have a portion or an inheritance among the other tribes of Israel; instead, they shall live on the offerings and sacrifices made to the Lord.
Deuteronomy 18:2 They shall not receive any other property from their brothers, the other tribes of Israel, because the Lord Himself is their inheritance and their possession, just as He promised them.
Deuteronomy 18:3 This is the customary right of the priests from the people who offer sacrifices: whether they sacrifice an ox or a sheep, they shall give the priest the shoulder, both cheeks, and the stomach.
Deuteronomy 18:4 They shall give the priest the first-fruits of their grain, their wine, and their olive oil, and the first sheared wool from their sheep.
Deuteronomy 18:5 For the Lord your God has chosen the tribe of Levi from all your tribes, so that they may stand to serve and minister in the name of the Lord, both they and their descendants forever.
Deuteronomy 18:6 If a Levite leaves one of your cities, wherever he may be living in any part of Israel, and he desires to come to the place which the Lord will choose for His worship,
Deuteronomy 18:7 he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, just like all his fellow Levite brothers who are standing there at that time before the Lord.
Deuteronomy 18:8 He shall receive the same portion of food and offerings as them, apart from what he already possesses from the sale of his ancestral property or his dwelling in his hometown.
Deuteronomy 18:9 When you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you, be careful not to imitate the detestable practices of those nations already living there.
Deuteronomy 18:10 Let no one be found among you who offers their son or daughter as a sacrifice by fire, nor anyone who consults oracles, or practices divination, or interprets omens, or observes dreams, or is a sorcerer,
Deuteronomy 18:11 nor one who casts spells, nor one who consults spirits of the dead (necromancers), nor a diviner, nor one who seeks answers from the deceased.
Deuteronomy 18:12 For all who do these things are detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices, He will drive those nations out before you as you enter the land.
Deuteronomy 18:13 You shall be blameless and wholehearted in your relationship with the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 18:14 These nations whose land you are about to possess listen to diviners and those who interpret omens. But the Lord your God has not permitted you to do such things, having given you a different teaching.
Deuteronomy 18:15 The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your own people, from your brothers, just like me—Moses. You must listen to Him.
Deuteronomy 18:16 This is exactly what you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb when the assembly was gathered, and you said, 'Let me not hear the voice of the Lord my God again, nor see this great fire anymore, lest I die!'
Deuteronomy 18:17 And the Lord said to me, 'What they have said is good and correct.'
Deuteronomy 18:18 'I will raise up for them a Prophet from among their brothers, one like you, Moses. I will put My words in His mouth, and He will speak to them everything that I command Him.'
Deuteronomy 18:19 'But whoever will not listen to His words, which He speaks in My name, I Myself will hold that person accountable.'
Deuteronomy 18:20 However, any prophet who, out of pride, presumes to speak a word in My name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall be put to death.
Deuteronomy 18:21 If you should ask yourself, 'How will we know if a message is truly from the Lord or not?'
Deuteronomy 18:22 You will have this sign: If what the prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not come true or if his message is confused and contradictory, then the Lord has not spoken it. Instead, the prophet has spoken it out of pride and presumption. Therefore, you need not fear him nor heed his words.
Deuteronomy 18:1 The Levitical priests, and indeed all men who are from that same tribe of Levi, will not be allowed to have an allotted portion of land or an inheritance among the rest of the people of Israel. Instead, they will live by eating from the sacrifices offered to the Lord and from His offerings.
Deuteronomy 18:2 They shall not receive anything else from the possessions of their Israelite brothers, because the Lord Himself is their inheritance, just as He promised them.
Deuteronomy 18:3 This is what the priests have a right to receive from the people, and from those who offer sacrifices: whether they sacrifice a bull or a sheep, they will give the priest the shoulder, both of the jaws, and the stomach.
Deuteronomy 18:4 They shall also receive the first fruits of the grain, the wine, and the oil, along with the first shearings of the sheep's wool for their own use.
Deuteronomy 18:5 For the Lord your God has specifically chosen him, from all your tribes, to stand and to serve in the Name of the Lord, both he and his sons forever.
Deuteronomy 18:6 If a Levite comes out of one of your cities, from any part of Israel where he has been living, and he comes to the place which the Lord has chosen to establish His presence,
Deuteronomy 18:7 then he shall serve in the Name of the Lord his God, just like all his fellow Levite brothers who stand there at that time before the Lord.
Deuteronomy 18:8 He will receive the same portion of food as they do, apart from what he has inherited from his family's city.
Deuteronomy 18:9 When you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you, be careful not to imitate the detestable practices of those pagan nations.
Deuteronomy 18:10 Let no one be found among you who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who consults diviners, or one who observes omens and auguries, nor any sorcerer,
Deuteronomy 18:11 nor one who casts spells, nor one who consults spirits, nor a fortuneteller, nor one who seeks truth from the dead.
Deuteronomy 18:12 For the Lord detests all these practices, and it is because of such crimes that He will destroy these nations before you when you enter the land.
Deuteronomy 18:13 You shall be perfect and without blemish before the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 18:14 These nations, whose land you are about to possess, listen to soothsayers and diviners; but you, however, have a different teaching from the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 18:15 The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet from among your own people, from your brothers, just like me—Moses is speaking here. You shall listen to Him.
Deuteronomy 18:16 This is exactly what you requested from the Lord your God at Horeb, when the assembly was gathered, and you said: "Let me no longer hear the voice of the Lord my God, and let me not see this immense fire any longer, lest I die."
Deuteronomy 18:17 And the Lord said to me, "They have spoken well in all they said."
Deuteronomy 18:18 "I will raise up a Prophet for them from among their brothers, just like you, and I will put My words in His mouth, and He will speak to them everything that I command Him."
Deuteronomy 18:19 "But whoever will not listen to the words that He speaks in My Name, I Myself will take vengeance upon him."
Deuteronomy 18:20 "However, a prophet who, revealing pride, presumes to speak words in My Name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of foreign gods, that prophet shall be put to death."
Deuteronomy 18:21 If you think in your heart: "How can I know which word the Lord has not spoken?"
Deuteronomy 18:22 This is the sign you will have: If a prophet, speaking in the Name of the Lord, predicts something and that thing does not happen, that is a word which the Lord has not spoken. Rather, the prophet uttered it out of his own proud spirit. Therefore, you shall not be afraid of him.
Deuteronomy 19:1 When the Lord your God completely destroys the nations from the land He is giving to you, and when you have taken possession of their land and settled in their cities and homes,
Deuteronomy 19:2 then you are to designate three cities in the middle of your land—the land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance.
Deuteronomy 19:3 You must make the roads to these cities clear and maintain them, and you shall divide the entire territory of your land, which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance, into three districts. These three cities of refuge will be distributed among these districts.
Deuteronomy 19:4 This is the law for a slayer who will flee to one of these cities and live: anyone who strikes his neighbor accidentally, without any prior malice or hatred towards him,
Deuteronomy 19:5 For example, if someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings the ax to fell a tree, the ax head accidentally flies off the handle, slips from his hand, and strikes his neighbor, killing him—such a person may flee to one of these cities of refuge and live.
Deuteronomy 19:6 Otherwise, the avenger of the slain, burning with rage, might pursue him and overtake him on the road, striking him dead. This would be a grave injustice, as the person is not deserving of death because he had no prior malice or hatred towards the one he accidentally killed.
Deuteronomy 19:7 Therefore, I command you to designate these three cities for yourselves.
Deuteronomy 19:8 And when the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your ancestors, and gives you all the land He promised them,
Deuteronomy 19:9 (This will happen only if you are careful to obey all these commandments and do what I am instructing you today, which is to love the Lord your God and walk in His ways at all times.)
Deuteronomy 19:10 then you must add three more cities of refuge to these, making the total number six, to double the initial three cities.
Deuteronomy 19:11 This is so that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle of your land, which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and thus make you guilty of bloodshed.
Deuteronomy 19:12 But if someone, driven by hatred for his neighbor, lies in wait, ambushes him, and strikes him dead, and then flees to one of these cities of refuge,
Deuteronomy 19:13 then the elders of his own city must send for him, seize him from the city of refuge, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, who will ensure he is put to death.
Deuteronomy 19:14 You must not move your neighbor's boundary markers, which were set by your ancestors in the land you will possess—the land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance.
Deuteronomy 19:15 A single witness is not sufficient to condemn anyone for any crime or wrongdoing. Every charge must be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Deuteronomy 19:16 If a malicious witness comes forward and testifies falsely against another person, accusing him of a transgression or a crime,
Deuteronomy 19:17 then both individuals involved in the dispute must stand before the Lord, in the presence of the priests and judges who are serving at that time.
Deuteronomy 19:18 The judges must investigate the matter thoroughly. If they find that the witness is indeed false and has lied against his fellow Israelite,
Deuteronomy 19:19 then you shall do to him exactly what he intended to do to his brother. In this way, you will purge that evil from your midst.
Deuteronomy 19:20 The others will hear of this judgment and be struck with fear, ensuring that such evil acts are not committed again in your midst.
Deuteronomy 19:21 Show no pity. The rule shall be: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot.
Deuteronomy 20:1 When you go out to fight your enemies, and you see their large armies with many horses and chariots, don't be afraid of them. The Lord your God is with you, the very God who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 20:2 When you are about to go into battle, a priest will stand nearby and speak to the people.
Deuteronomy 20:3 He will say to them: 'Listen, O Israel! Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be faint of heart. Do not be afraid, do not panic, and do not be terrified by them.'
Deuteronomy 20:4 Because the Lord your God is right there with you, and He Himself will fight on your behalf against your adversaries.
Deuteronomy 20:5 After the priest has finished speaking, the officers will then say to the people: 'Is there any man here who has built a new house and has not yet dedicated it? Let him return home now, so that he does not die in battle, and another man dedicates his house instead.'
Deuteronomy 20:6 'Is there any man here who has planted a vineyard and has not yet enjoyed its first harvest? Let him return home now, so that he does not die in battle and another man gets to enjoy his first harvest.'
Deuteronomy 20:7 'Is there any man here who has become engaged to a woman but has not yet married her? Let him return home now, so that he does not die in battle and another man marries her.'
Deuteronomy 20:8 The officers will then add this instruction and speak to the people: 'Is there any man here who is afraid and faint-hearted? Let him return home now, so that his brothers' hearts do not also become afraid and tremble like his own.'
Deuteronomy 20:9 Once everyone has heard these instructions and is ready for battle, then you must appoint officers: commanders over thousands, commanders over hundreds, and other leaders for the army.
Deuteronomy 20:10 When you approach a city to attack it, you must first offer it terms of peace.
Deuteronomy 20:11 If the city agrees to accept your terms and opens its gates to you, then all the people who live in it will be spared, and they will serve you as forced laborers, paying tribute.
Deuteronomy 20:12 But if the city refuses to make peace with you and instead chooses to wage war, then you must lay siege to it.
Deuteronomy 20:13 And when the Lord your God delivers that city into your hand, you must strike down every male in it with the edge of the sword.
Deuteronomy 20:14 However, you may take for yourselves the women, the young children, the livestock, and all other belongings found in the city as plunder. You are permitted to use these spoils of your enemies, which the Lord your God has given to you.
Deuteronomy 20:15 This is how you must deal with all the cities that are located very far from you. These are the cities that are not among those you are destined to conquer and claim as your permanent land.
Deuteronomy 20:16 However, in the cities within the land that the Lord your God is giving to you as an inheritance, you must not allow anything that breathes to remain alive.
Deuteronomy 20:17 Instead, you must utterly destroy these peoples—the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites—just as the Lord your God has commanded you.
Deuteronomy 20:18 Otherwise, they will teach you to imitate all the abominable practices that they perform for their idols, and you will then sin against the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 20:19 When you lay siege to a city for a long time, surrounding it with fortifications in order to capture it, do not cut down its fruit-bearing trees. You must not use an axe to destroy them, for a tree provides wood and food, and it is not a human being who can fight against you in battle.
Deuteronomy 20:20 However, if there is a tree that is not a fruit-bearing tree, but a wild tree that is suitable for building, you may cut it down. Use these trees to construct siege engines and other works until the city is captured.
Deuteronomy 20:1 When you go out to battle against your enemies, and you see that they have many horses and chariots, and a greater army than you do, do not be afraid of them. For the Lord your God is with you—the same God who led you out from the land of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 20:2 When the battle is about to begin, the priest shall step forward before the battle lines and speak to the people, saying:
Deuteronomy 20:3 Listen, O Israel! Today you are going out to fight against your enemies. Let your hearts not be afraid, do not fear, do not yield, and do not be terrified by them.
Deuteronomy 20:4 Because the Lord your God is in your midst, and He Himself will fight for you against your adversaries.
Deuteronomy 20:5 Then the officers in the army shall proclaim in a loud voice, so that the people can hear: "Has anyone built a new house but not yet dedicated it? Let him go and return to his home, lest he die in battle and another man dedicate it."
Deuteronomy 20:6  "Has anyone planted a vineyard but not yet harvested its fruit? Let him go and return to his home, lest he die in battle and another man harvest it."
Deuteronomy 20:7  "Has anyone become engaged to a woman but not yet married her? Let him go and return to his home, lest he die in battle and another man marry her."
Deuteronomy 20:8 And the officers shall add, speaking further to the people: "Who is a man who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his home, lest he fill the hearts of his brothers with terror and make them afraid too."
Deuteronomy 20:9 When all these announcements have been made and the people have been commanded to prepare for battle, then the leaders of the companies shall lead the army.
Deuteronomy 20:10 When you approach a city to attack it, you shall first offer it terms of peace.
Deuteronomy 20:11 If the city accepts your offer and opens its gates to you, then all the people who are in it shall become your servants and pay tribute to you.
Deuteronomy 20:12 But if it refuses to make peace and a treaty with you, and begins to wage war against you, then you shall besiege it.
Deuteronomy 20:13 And when the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike down every male within it with the edge of the sword.
Deuteronomy 20:14 But the women, children, livestock, and everything else in the city—all its plunder—you shall take for yourselves. You may eat the spoils of your enemies, which the Lord your God has given to you.
Deuteronomy 20:15 This is what you shall do to all the cities that are very far from you, and which are not among the cities you are about to receive as your own possession.
Deuteronomy 20:16 However, concerning these cities that are given to you as a possession—the ones within the promised land—you shall not let anyone remain alive who breathes.
Deuteronomy 20:17 Instead, you must utterly destroy them with the edge of the sword: the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, just as the Lord your God has commanded you.
Deuteronomy 20:18 Do this so that they may not teach you to imitate their idolatrous practices, and thereby cause you to sin against the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 20:19 When you besiege a city for a long time, surrounding it with fortifications in order to capture it, you shall not cut down its fruit trees, nor lay waste to the region with an axe. For the tree is wood, not a man, and therefore it cannot fight against you.
Deuteronomy 20:20 But if there is a tree that is not a fruit-bearing tree, but a wild tree suitable for work—meaning it produces timber—you may cut it down and use it to build siege works until you capture the city that is fighting against you.
Deuteronomy 21:1 If a man is found murdered in the land that the Lord your God will give you to possess, lying dead in the open fields, and the identity of the one who struck him dead is unknown:
Deuteronomy 21:2 Then your elders and judges must go out and measure the distance from where the corpse lies to the nearest surrounding towns.
Deuteronomy 21:3 And the elders of the city that is found to be the closest to the body must take a young heifer from the herd, one that has never been put under a yoke or used for any work.
Deuteronomy 21:4 They shall bring the heifer to a rugged valley that has never been plowed or sown with seed, and there they shall break its neck.
Deuteronomy 21:5 Then the priests of the Levitical lineage (for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to Him, and to bless in His name, and by their word every dispute and every matter of clean or unclean is to be judged) shall come forward.
Deuteronomy 21:6 And the elders of that city which was found closest to the murdered man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.
Deuteronomy 21:7 And they shall declare: "Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes witness it.
Deuteronomy 21:8 Be merciful, O Lord, to Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed; and do not allow innocent blood to remain among Your people Israel." And so the guilt of the blood shall be atoned for.
Deuteronomy 21:9 Thus you shall remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when you have done what the Lord commands.
Deuteronomy 21:10 If you go out to fight against your enemies, and the Lord your God delivers them into your power, and you take them as captives of war:
Deuteronomy 21:11 And if you see a beautiful woman among the captives, and you desire her, and wish to take her as your wife:
Deuteronomy 21:12 You must bring her into your house. She shall then shave all the hair from her head, and she must trim her nails (these actions are part of a purification ritual for a non-Israelite woman).
Deuteronomy 21:13 And she shall remove the clothing in which she was captured. She must then sit in your house and mourn her father and mother for one full month. After this period, you may go in to her, and sleep with her; and you shall be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
Deuteronomy 21:14 But if afterwards you no longer desire to have her as your wife, you must let her go free. You shall not sell her for money, nor shall you treat her as a slave, because you have humbled her (by taking her as a wife and then rejecting her).
Deuteronomy 21:15 If a man has two wives, one dearly loved and the other hated, and both have borne him children, and the firstborn son happens to be the son of the hated wife:
Deuteronomy 21:16 Then, when he divides his inheritance among his sons, he may not treat the son of the loved wife as the firstborn, preferring him over the son of the hated wife, who is indeed the true firstborn.
Deuteronomy 21:17 Instead, he must acknowledge the son of the hated wife as the firstborn, and give him a double portion of all that he possesses. For that son is the first fruit of his strength, and the right of the firstborn belongs to him.
Deuteronomy 21:18 If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not listen to the words of his father or his mother, and though corrected, stubbornly refuses to obey:
Deuteronomy 21:19 His father and mother shall both take hold of him and bring him before the elders of the city, at the city gate where judgments are made.
Deuteronomy 21:20 And they shall say to the elders: "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he refuses to listen to our commands, and he is given over to gluttony and drunkenness."
Deuteronomy 21:21 Then all the people of that city shall stone him with stones, and he shall die. You must remove this evil from among you, so that all of Israel may hear and be filled with fear (and learn from his example).
Deuteronomy 21:22 When a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he has been put to death and then hung on a tree (as a public display):
Deuteronomy 21:23 His corpse shall not remain on the tree overnight. You must bury him on the same day, because anyone hung on a tree is cursed by God. Do not defile the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
Deuteronomy 21:1 If a man is found slain in the land—the territory the Lord your God is giving you to possess—lying in a field, and it is not known who killed him,
Deuteronomy 21:2 then your elders and your judges must go out and measure the distance from the place where the body lies to the nearest towns.
Deuteronomy 21:3 Whichever town they determine is the closest, the elders of that town must take a heifer from the herd—one that has never been used for work, neither pulling a yoke nor an plow.
Deuteronomy 21:4 They must lead the heifer to a rugged valley that has never been tilled or sown with seeds, and there, in the dry riverbed, they must break the heifer’s neck.
Deuteronomy 21:5 Then the priests, who are from the tribe of Levi, must approach—because the Lord your God chose them to minister to Him and to bless in the name of the Lord, and by their word, every matter, both clean and unclean, is to be judged.
Deuteronomy 21:6 And all the elders of that town, which is nearest to the slain man, must wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.
Deuteronomy 21:7 Then they must declare: 'Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes witness this crime.'
Deuteronomy 21:8 They must pray: 'Be merciful, O Lord, to Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed. Do not hold the guilt of this innocent blood against Your people Israel.' And the guilt of that blood will be forgiven them—it will be expiated for them.
Deuteronomy 21:9 Thus, you will remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when you do what the Lord has commanded.
Deuteronomy 21:10 When you go out to battle against your enemies, and the Lord your God delivers them into your hand, and you take captives—
Deuteronomy 21:11 and you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you desire her and want to take her as your wife—
Deuteronomy 21:12 you must bring her into your house. She must shave her head and trim her nails.
Deuteronomy 21:13 She must remove the clothes in which she was captured and remain in your house, mourning her father and mother for one full month. After that period, you may go in to her, lie with her, and she will be your wife, and you her husband.
Deuteronomy 21:14 But if you no longer desire her, you must let her go free. You are not to sell her for money, nor oppress her by force, because you have humbled her—taken away her former dignity.
Deuteronomy 21:15 If a man has two wives, one who is loved and another who is disliked, and both bear him sons, but the firstborn son is from the disliked wife, and the second son is from the loved wife—
Deuteronomy 21:16 when he divides his inheritance among his sons, he cannot make the son of the loved wife the firstborn, preferring him over the son of the disliked wife, who is the true and legitimate firstborn.
Deuteronomy 21:17 Instead, he must acknowledge the firstborn son of the disliked wife by giving him a double portion of all he possesses. For that son is the first of his strength, and the rights of the firstborn belong to him.
Deuteronomy 21:18 If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not listen to the words of his father or his mother, and even when corrected, he scorns to obey—
Deuteronomy 21:19 his father and mother must both take hold of him and bring him to the elders of his town, at the gate where judicial matters are heard.
Deuteronomy 21:20 They must say to the elders: 'This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he refuses to listen to our warnings. He is given to gluttony, drunkenness, and wild feasts.'
Deuteronomy 21:21 Then all the people of his town must stone him to death. You must remove this evil from among you, and all Israel, hearing of it, will be struck with fear.
Deuteronomy 21:22 If a man has committed a sin worthy of death and is executed, and afterward his body is hanged on a tree—
Deuteronomy 21:23 his corpse must not remain on the tree overnight. You must bury him the same day. For a hanged man is cursed by God, and you must not defile your land, which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
Deuteronomy 22:1 If you see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep wandering astray, you must not ignore it or walk away as if it does not concern you. Instead, you must make sure to bring it back to him.
Deuteronomy 22:2 Even if your fellow Israelite is not nearby, or you do not know him, you must bring the animal into your own house. It must stay with you until your fellow Israelite asks for it, and then you must return it to him.
Deuteronomy 22:3 You must do the same for a donkey, a piece of clothing, and any lost thing belonging to your fellow Israelite that you find. You must not neglect any such thing.
Deuteronomy 22:4 You must not see your fellow Israelite’s donkey or ox collapsed on the road and walk by as if it does not concern you. Instead, you must help the animal get back up.
Deuteronomy 22:5 A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor may a man wear women’s clothing. Whoever does such things is an abomination to God.
Deuteronomy 22:6 If, while walking along the road, you find a bird’s nest in a tree or on the ground with a mother bird sitting on her young or on her eggs, you must not take the mother along with the young.
Deuteronomy 22:7 Instead, you must let the mother bird fly away, and then you may take the young for yourself. This command ensures your well-being and a long life.
Deuteronomy 22:8 When you build a new house, you must build a parapet wall around the edge of the roof. This is to prevent anyone from falling off the roof, so that you do not incur the guilt of bloodshed in your home.
Deuteronomy 22:9 You must not plant your vineyard with two different kinds of seeds. If you do, both the crop you sow and the produce from the vines will be declared holy and therefore forbidden to you.
Deuteronomy 22:10 You must not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
Deuteronomy 22:11 You must not wear clothing made of wool and linen woven together.
Deuteronomy 22:12 You must make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.
Deuteronomy 22:13 If a man takes a wife, and after having relations with her, he comes to hate her,
Deuteronomy 22:14 and he accuses her of a terrible crime and slanders her, saying, 'I took this woman as my wife, and when I had relations with her, I found no evidence that she was a virgin!'
Deuteronomy 22:15 then the girl’s parents and her witnesses must gather the evidence of her virginity and bring it to the elders of the city, who are seated at the city gate.
Deuteronomy 22:16 And they must say to the elders, 'We gave our daughter to this man as his wife. Now he hates her,
Deuteronomy 22:17 and has accused her of a terrible crime, saying, 'I found your daughter was not a virgin.' But here is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity!—and they must spread the garment before the elders of the city.
Deuteronomy 22:18 Therefore, the elders of that city must take the man and publicly beat him. They must also fine him one hundred silver shekels, which they must give to the girl’s father,
Deuteronomy 22:19 because he slandered an Israelite virgin. He will not be permitted to divorce her for the rest of his life.
Deuteronomy 22:20 However, if the accusation he made is true, and no evidence of virginity is found in the girl,
Deuteronomy 22:21 then they must bring her out to the entrance of her father’s house, and the men of her city must stone her to death. She has committed an outrage in Israel by defiling herself through fornication while still in her father’s house. You must remove this evil from your midst.
Deuteronomy 22:22 If a man is found lying with another man’s wife, both of them—the adulterer and the adulteress—must be put to death. You must remove this evil from Israel.
Deuteronomy 22:23 If a man finds a virgin girl who is betrothed to another man within a city, and he lies with her,
Deuteronomy 22:24 you must bring both of them to the city gate and stone them to death. The girl must die because she did not cry out for help, even though she was in the city. The man must die because he violated his neighbor’s betrothed wife. You must remove this evil from your midst.
Deuteronomy 22:25 But if a man finds a betrothed girl in the open country and seizes her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her must be put to death.
Deuteronomy 22:26 The girl is innocent and deserves no punishment of death, because this crime is like a man ambushing and murdering another man. That is how the girl suffered.
Deuteronomy 22:27 She was alone in the open country, she cried out, but there was no one to rescue her.
Deuteronomy 22:28 If a man finds a virgin girl who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered,
Deuteronomy 22:29 the man who lay with her must pay the girl’s father fifty silver shekels. He must also take the girl as his wife, because he violated her, and he will not be permitted to divorce her for the rest of his life.
Deuteronomy 22:30 A man must not marry his father’s wife, nor may he have sexual relations with her.
Deuteronomy 22:1 You must not see your kinsman's ox or sheep wandering away and ignore it as if it isn't your concern. Instead, you must bring it back to your kinsman.
Deuteronomy 22:2 But if your kinsman isn't nearby, or if you don't know who the owner is, then you must bring the animal to your own house. Keep it with you there until your kinsman comes looking for it, and then you must return it to him.
Deuteronomy 22:3 You must do the same for your kinsman's donkey, or his garment, or any other lost property of your kinsman. If you find something, you must not neglect it or pretend you didn't see it.
Deuteronomy 22:4 You must not see your kinsman's donkey or ox collapsed on the road and just walk by as if it's none of your business. Instead, you must help him lift it up.
Deuteronomy 22:5 A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor must a man wear women's clothing. For all who do these things are utterly detestable in the sight of God.
Deuteronomy 22:6 If you find a bird's nest on the road, or in a tree, or on the ground, with the mother bird sitting on chicks or eggs, you must not take the mother with her young.
Deuteronomy 22:7 But you must allow the mother to fly away, and then you may take the young for yourself, so that it may go well with you and you may live a long time.
Deuteronomy 22:8 When you build a new house, you must build a parapet or railing around your roof. This is to ensure that if someone falls from it, the guilt of bloodshed will not rest upon your house.
Deuteronomy 22:9 You must not sow your vineyard with two different kinds of seed. If you do, the entire harvest—both the crop you planted and the fruit of the vineyard—will become consecrated for God, meaning it will be forfeited.
Deuteronomy 22:10 You must not plow with an ox and a donkey harnessed together.
Deuteronomy 22:11 You must not wear clothing woven from wool and linen together.
Deuteronomy 22:12 You must make cords or tassels on the four corners of the cloak with which you cover yourself.
Deuteronomy 22:13 If a man takes a wife, and after having relations with her, he comes to hate her,
Deuteronomy 22:14 and then he invents disgraceful accusations against her, saying: "I took this woman as my wife, and when I went in to her, I did not find in her the signs of her virginity—meaning, proof that she was a virgin before our marriage."
Deuteronomy 22:15 Then the father and mother of the young woman must take the proof of her virginity and bring it with them to the elders of the city, who sit in the gate for judgment.
Deuteronomy 22:16 And the father will say: "I gave my daughter to this man as his wife, but now he hates her,"
Deuteronomy 22:17 and he has falsely accused her, saying: "I did not find your daughter to be a virgin." But here is the proof of my daughter's virginity." And they will spread the garment before the elders of the city.
Deuteronomy 22:18 Then the elders of that city must take that man and punish him with lashes.
Deuteronomy 22:19 Moreover, they must fine him one hundred pieces of gold, which he must give to the young woman's father. This is because he defamed a virgin of Israel with a wicked accusation. He must also continue to have her as his wife and will not be permitted to divorce her for all the days of his life.
Deuteronomy 22:20 But if the accusation is true, and the proofs of virginity were not found in the young woman:
Deuteronomy 22:21 Then they must bring her out to the entrance of her father's house, and the men of her city must stone her to death. This is because she committed an outrageous act in Israel by committing fornication while in her father's house. Thus, you must remove such wickedness from among you.
Deuteronomy 22:22 If a man is caught sleeping with another man's wife, both of them must die—that is, both the adulterer and the adulteress. Thus, you must remove such wickedness from Israel.
Deuteronomy 22:23 If a young woman, a virgin, is engaged to a man, and someone finds her in the city and has relations with her:
Deuteronomy 22:24 Both of them must be brought to the gate of that city, and they must be stoned to death. The young woman must die because she did not cry out for help, even though she was in the city. The man must die because he violated his kinsman's betrothed wife. Thus, you must remove such wickedness from among you.
Deuteronomy 22:25 However, if a man finds an engaged young woman in the open country and seizes her and has relations with her, then only the man must die.
Deuteronomy 22:26 The young woman will suffer no punishment and is not guilty of death. This is because she is like a man who is ambushed by a robber and violently attacked—just so, the young woman suffered this violence.
Deuteronomy 22:27 She cried out for help, but there was no one to rescue her.
Deuteronomy 22:28 If a man finds a young virgin woman who is not engaged, and he seizes her and has relations with her, and he is caught in the act:
Deuteronomy 22:29 Then the man who had relations with her must give the young woman's father fifty pieces of silver. He must also take her as his wife, because he violated her, and he will not be permitted to divorce her for all the days of his life.
Deuteronomy 22:30 A man must not take his father's wife as his own, nor uncover her father's nakedness. This means he must not have sexual relations with her.
Deuteronomy 23:1 A man who has had his testicles crushed or cut off, or his penis cut off, shall not enter the assembly of the Lord’s people.
Deuteronomy 23:2 A mamzer—that is, a child born from an unchaste woman or an illicit union—shall not enter the assembly of the Lord, not even to the tenth generation.
Deuteronomy 23:3 The Ammonites and the Moabites shall not enter the assembly of the Lord, not even to the tenth generation, and even beyond that, forever.
Deuteronomy 23:4 This is because they did not come out to meet you with bread and water on the road when you were coming out of Egypt. And also because they hired Balaam, the son of Beor, from Mesopotamia of Syria, to curse you.
Deuteronomy 23:5 However, the Lord your God would not listen to Balaam, and He turned Balaam’s curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord loved you.
Deuteronomy 23:6 You shall never make peace with them, nor any alliance, forever.
Deuteronomy 23:7 You shall not detest an Edomite, because he is your brother. Nor shall you detest an Egyptian, because you were once an immigrant in his land.
Deuteronomy 23:8 The children who are born to them in the third generation may enter the assembly of the Lord.
Deuteronomy 23:9 When you go out to battle against your enemies, you shall guard yourself from every wicked thing.
Deuteronomy 23:10 If there is any man among you who has become unclean from a nocturnal emission—a wet dream—he shall go outside the camp and shall not return until he has washed himself with water.
Deuteronomy 23:11 And after sunset, having washed away all impurity, he may re-enter the camp.
Deuteronomy 23:12 You shall have a designated place outside the camp for the necessities of nature, a place suitable for cleanliness.
Deuteronomy 23:13 You shall also have a digging tool among your provisions, and when you sit outside the camp for defecation, you shall dig in the ground and cover whatever you have expelled.
Deuteronomy 23:14 For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you and to hand over your enemies to you. Therefore, your camp must be holy, and nothing indecent or impure shall appear in it, lest God abandon you.
Deuteronomy 23:15 If a servant who has fled his master seeks refuge with you, you shall not hand him over to his master.
Deuteronomy 23:16 Instead, he shall remain with you in the place that pleases him and in one of your cities, wherever he desires. You shall not oppress him.
Deuteronomy 23:17 There shall be no harlot among the daughters of Israel, nor any male prostitute among the sons of Israel.
Deuteronomy 23:18 You shall not bring the wages of a prostitute, nor the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord your God, no matter what you have vowed. For both of these are detestable to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 23:19 You shall not lend money to your brother at interest, nor grain, nor any other thing.
Deuteronomy 23:20 But you may lend to a foreigner. To your brother, however, you shall lend without charging interest, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all your work in the land which you are entering to possess.
Deuteronomy 23:21 When you make a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay fulfilling it. For the Lord your God will surely require it of you, and if you delay, it will be counted as a sin for you.
Deuteronomy 23:22 If you choose not to make a promise by vowing, you will be without sin.
Deuteronomy 23:23 Whatever has come out of your lips, you shall keep and perform, just as you promised to the Lord your God, for you spoke it of your own free will and with your own mouth.
Deuteronomy 23:24 When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat grapes as much as you like to satisfy yourself, but you shall not carry any away from the vineyard.
Deuteronomy 23:25 If you enter your friend’s standing grain field, you may pluck heads of grain and rub them in your hand, but you shall not use a sickle to harvest his grain.
Deuteronomy 24:1 If a man takes a wife and marries her, but she does not find favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her—a shameful act that makes her displeasing to him—then he must write a certificate of divorce for her, put it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
Deuteronomy 24:2 And when she has left him and gone from him, and taken another husband,
Deuteronomy 24:3 and if that second husband also dislikes her and gives her a certificate of divorce, sending her out of his house—or if this second husband dies,
Deuteronomy 24:4 then her first husband cannot take her back as his wife, because she has been defiled and has become abominable before the Lord. You must not allow such a sin to pollute your land, which the Lord your God is about to give you as an inheritance.
Deuteronomy 24:5 When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out to war, nor shall any public duty be imposed upon him. He must be free from any obligation at home for one year, and he shall make his wife whom he has taken happy.
Deuteronomy 24:6 You shall not take the lower and upper millstones as a pledge—the grinding equipment necessary for daily bread—nor a fulling mill; for that would be taking a man's very livelihood as a pledge, which is like taking his soul.
Deuteronomy 24:7 If a man is found kidnapping one of his brothers from the children of Israel, and selling him, or if he is found exploiting him for profit, that kidnapper must die. You are to remove this evil from among you.
Deuteronomy 24:8 Be very careful to observe the laws concerning leprosy. Do everything the Levitical priests instruct you, just as I commanded them, and fulfill their instructions fully.
Deuteronomy 24:9 Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam—Moses' sister—on the way when you came out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 24:10 When you lend money to your neighbor, you shall not enter his house to take a pledge from him.
Deuteronomy 24:11 Instead, you must stand outside, and he himself shall bring you what he has as a pledge.
Deuteronomy 24:12 If, however, the borrower is a poor man, his pledge shall not remain with you overnight.
Deuteronomy 24:13 You must return it to him at sunset, so that he may sleep in his garment and bless you. This act of justice will be counted to you before the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 24:14 You shall not deny payment to a poor and needy hired servant, whether he is one of your own brothers or an alien residing with you in your land.
Deuteronomy 24:15 But on the very same day, you must pay him his wages before the sun sets, for he is poor and depends on that money for his very life. If you do not pay him, he may cry out to the Lord against you, and it will be counted as a sin to you.
Deuteronomy 24:16 Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers. Each person shall die for his own sin.
Deuteronomy 24:17 You shall not pervert the justice due to an alien or an orphan, nor shall you take a widow's garment as a pledge.
Deuteronomy 24:18 But remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, and the Lord your God delivered you from there. Therefore, I command you to do this thing—to show justice and mercy to the vulnerable.
Deuteronomy 24:19 When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf of grain there, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the alien, the orphan, and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
Deuteronomy 24:20 When you beat your olive trees to gather their fruit, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave whatever remains on the trees for the alien, the orphan, and the widow.
Deuteronomy 24:21 When you gather the grapes from your vineyard, do not collect the remaining clusters. You must allow them to go to the alien, the orphan, and the widow.
Deuteronomy 24:22 Remember that you also were slaves in Egypt, and for that reason, I command you to do this thing—to care for the needy as you were once cared for.
Deuteronomy 24:1 If a man takes a woman as his wife and marries her,
and she does not find favor in his eyes because of some indecency or moral defect discovered in her,
then he is to write a bill of divorce.
He must give this document into her hand,
and then he is to send her out of his house.
Deuteronomy 24:2 And when she has gone out from him and departed,
and then has joined herself in marriage to another man,
Deuteronomy 24:3 and that man also comes to detest her,
and has written her a bill of divorce, and given it into her hand, and sent her out of his house—
or if that man has died certainly,
Deuteronomy 24:4 then the former husband will not be able to take her back as his wife,
because she is now defiled, and has become an abomination before the Lord.
You must not bring such a sin upon the land
which the Lord your God is giving you to possess.
Deuteronomy 24:5 If a man has recently married a wife,
he shall not go out to war, nor shall any compulsory service be imposed upon him.
Instead, he shall be free from all obligations at his home for one year,
so that he may bring joy to the wife whom he has taken.
Deuteronomy 24:6 You shall not take as security the lower or upper millstone,
nor the implements of a fuller (which are essential for his work),
because by doing so, one pledges a person's very means of life itself.
Deuteronomy 24:7 If a man is caught kidnapping one of his brothers from among the children of Israel,
and then sells him for a price, having received money for him,
that man shall be taken away and put to death.
Thus, you shall remove this evil from your midst.
Deuteronomy 24:8 Take careful heed that you do not contract the plague of leprosy.
You must do everything that the priests of the Levitical lineage have taught you.
You shall diligently fulfill and carry out everything according to what I have commanded them.
Deuteronomy 24:9 Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam (the sister of Moses) on the journey,
when you were coming out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 24:10 When you lend money to your neighbor,
you shall not enter his house to take a pledge (or collateral).
Deuteronomy 24:11 Instead, you shall stand outside,
and he himself shall bring out to you whatever he has for a pledge.
Deuteronomy 24:12 If he is a poor man,
the pledge (such as a garment needed for warmth) shall not remain with you overnight.
Deuteronomy 24:13 But you shall immediately return it to him in the evening,
so that when he sleeps in his own garment, he may bless you.
This act of mercy will be counted as righteousness for you before the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 24:14 You shall not oppress a poor and needy hired servant,
whether he is one of your own people,
or a foreigner who dwells with you in your land.
Deuteronomy 24:15 But on the very same day, you shall pay him his wages before the sun sets,
because he is poor and depends on it to sustain his very life.
Otherwise, he might cry out against you to the Lord,
and it will be counted as a sin for you.
Deuteronomy 24:16 A father shall not be put to death for the sin of his son,
nor shall a son be put to death for the sin of his father.
Each person shall die for his own sin.
Deuteronomy 24:17 You shall not pervert the justice due to a foreigner or an orphan,
nor shall you take a widow's garment as a pledge (for it is her only covering).
Deuteronomy 24:18 Remember that you yourselves were slaves in Egypt,
and the Lord your God delivered you from there (from your slavery).
Therefore, I command you to do this thing (to care for the vulnerable).
Deuteronomy 24:19 When you reap your harvest in your field,
and have forgotten a sheaf of grain and left it behind,
you shall not return again to take it.
Instead, you shall leave it for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow to gather,
so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
Deuteronomy 24:20 When you beat down the fruit from your olive trees,
you shall not go back again to gather what remains on the branches.
Instead, you shall leave it for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.
Deuteronomy 24:21 When you gather the grapes from your vineyard,
you shall not collect the remaining clusters of grapes.
Instead, you shall leave them for the resident foreigner, the orphan, and the widow.
Deuteronomy 24:22 Remember that you yourselves were also slaves in Egypt,
and therefore I command you to do this thing (to care for the needy).
Deuteronomy 25:1 If a legal dispute arises between men, and a judgment is needed to resolve it, and the judges render a just verdict, declaring the guilty party condemned and the innocent party absolved:
Deuteronomy 25:2 If the guilty party is deserving of physical punishment, the judge must have him laid down and beaten with rods in his presence, according to the severity of his sin and the manner of the beating.
Deuteronomy 25:3 The punishment must not exceed forty blows, so that your brother, the one receiving the punishment, is not too severely disgraced and disfigured beyond what is humanely bearable.
Deuteronomy 25:4 You must not muzzle an ox while it is threshing your grain in the threshing floor, for it deserves to eat from the fruits of its labor.
Deuteronomy 25:5 When brothers live together and one of them dies without having children, his widow must not marry an outsider. Instead, her late husband’s brother must marry her to raise up an heir for his deceased brother's lineage, and the firstborn son they have together will be named after the deceased brother.
Deuteronomy 25:6 If the brother refuses to marry his deceased brother’s wife, as he is legally bound to do, the woman must go to the city gate and appeal to the elders, declaring: 'My husband’s brother refuses to perpetuate his brother’s name in Israel, and he will not take me as his wife.'
Deuteronomy 25:7 The elders will immediately summon him and question him. If he replies: 'I do not wish to marry her as my wife:'
Deuteronomy 25:8 Then the woman must approach him in the presence of the elders, and she will remove his sandal from his foot, and spit in his face, saying: 'This is what happens to the man who refuses to build up his brother’s household and continue his legacy.'
Deuteronomy 25:9 And in Israel, his family name will forever be known as 'the house of the one who lost his sandal,' marking his failure to fulfill his duty.
Deuteronomy 25:10 If two men are fighting, and the wife of one of them tries to rescue her husband from the stronger man by reaching out her hand and grabbing his private parts:
Deuteronomy 25:11 You must cut off her hand, showing her no pity for such an indecent and aggressive act.
Deuteronomy 25:12 You must not keep two different kinds of weights in your bag, a heavier one for buying and a lighter one for selling, for such dishonesty is an abomination.
Deuteronomy 25:13 And you must not have two different kinds of measures in your house, a larger one for buying and a smaller one for selling.
Deuteronomy 25:14 You must always have honest and accurate weights and measures. This practice will ensure you live a long time in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.
Deuteronomy 25:15 For the Lord your God detests anyone who commits such injustices, for He is fundamentally opposed to all wickedness and dishonesty.
Deuteronomy 25:16 You must not keep two different kinds of weights in your bag, a heavier one for buying and a lighter one for selling, for such dishonesty is an abomination.
Deuteronomy 25:17 Remember what the Amalekites did to you on your journey when you were coming out of Egypt.
Deuteronomy 25:18 Remember how they attacked you along the way, striking down all the stragglers at the very rear of your column who were exhausted and faltering, while you were hungry and thirsty, and they did this without any fear of God.
Deuteronomy 25:19 Therefore, when the Lord your God grants you rest from all your enemies surrounding you in the land He is giving you as an inheritance, you must completely wipe out the memory of the Amalekites from under the sky. Make sure you never forget this command.
Deuteronomy 26:1 When you finally enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess, and you have taken it over and settled down there to live in it:
Deuteronomy 26:2 you are to take some of the first fruits of all the produce of your land that you harvest from the land the Lord your God has given you. Put them in a basket, and go to the specific place that the Lord your God will choose for His Name to be praised and invoked there.
Deuteronomy 26:3 And you shall go to the priest who is ministering in those days, and you shall say to him: "I declare today before the Lord your God that I have come into the land for which the Lord swore to our fathers that He would give it to us."
Deuteronomy 26:4 And the priest will take the basket from your hand and place it before the altar of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 26:5 And you shall speak and say in the presence of the Lord your God: "A wandering Aramean was my father Jacob, who went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien with a very small number of people. He grew there into a great nation, powerful and of immense multitude."
Deuteronomy 26:6 "And the Egyptians afflicted us and persecuted us, imposing heavy burdens upon us."
Deuteronomy 26:7 "And we cried out to the Lord God of our fathers, and He heard us. He looked upon our affliction, our toil, and our distress."
Deuteronomy 26:8 "And He led us out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, with signs, and with wonders, and with great terror."
Deuteronomy 26:9 "And He brought us into this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy 26:10 "And therefore, now I offer the first fruits of the produce of the land which the Lord has given me." And you shall place them down in the presence of the Lord your God, and you shall adore the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 26:11 And you shall rejoice in all the good things that the Lord your God has given to you and to your household—you, and the Levite, and the foreigner who lives among you.
Deuteronomy 26:12 When you have finished setting aside the tenth part of all your produce, during the third year, which is the year for tithing, you shall give it to the Levite, and to the foreigner, and to the orphan, and to the widow, so that they may eat within your towns and be fully satisfied.
Deuteronomy 26:13 And you shall speak in the presence of the Lord your God: "I have taken the holy portion from my house and have given it to the Levite, and to the foreigner, and to the orphan, and to the widow, just as You commanded me, neither going beyond Your commands nor forgetting them."
Deuteronomy 26:14 "I have not eaten any of it while in mourning, nor have I set aside any of it for any unclean purpose, nor have I given any of it for the dead. I have obeyed the voice of the Lord my God, and I have done everything just as You commanded me."
Deuteronomy 26:15 "Look down from Your holy sanctuary, from Your exalted dwelling place in the heavens (the spiritual realm), and bless Your people Israel, and the land You have given us, just as You swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey."
Deuteronomy 26:16 Today the Lord your God has commanded you to perform these statutes and judgments. Therefore, you must carefully keep and fulfill them with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy 26:17 You have chosen the Lord today to be your God, and to walk in His ways, and to keep His ceremonies, and His commands, and His judgments, and to obey His voice.
Deuteronomy 26:18 And the Lord has chosen you today to be His own special people, just as He promised you, and to carefully keep all His commands.
Deuteronomy 26:19 And He will make you higher than all the nations He has created, in praise, and in name, and in His glory, so that you may be a holy people to the Lord your God, just as He has promised.
Deuteronomy 26:1 When you enter the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, and you have taken hold of it and settled there,
Deuteronomy 26:2 you shall take some of the first of all the produce of your land that you harvest from your soil, and put it in a basket, and you shall go to the special place where the Lord your God has chosen for His Name to be invoked and worshiped.
Deuteronomy 26:3 and present yourself to the priest who is serving during that time, and declare to him: 'Today I openly declare before the Lord your God that I have entered the land concerning which the Lord swore an oath to our fathers that He would give it to us.'
Deuteronomy 26:4 The priest shall then take the basket from your hand, and place it before the altar of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 26:5 Then you shall speak and say in the presence of the Lord your God: 'An Aramean (Laban) once afflicted my ancestor, Jacob, who was a wanderer about to perish. He went down into Egypt and lived there as an alien with only a small group. But there he grew into a great, strong, and countless nation.
Deuteronomy 26:6 Then the Egyptians afflicted us and persecuted us by imposing heavy burdens upon us.
Deuteronomy 26:7 So we cried out to the Lord, the God of our fathers, and He heard us and saw our humility, our suffering, and our oppression.
Deuteronomy 26:8 and He brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, amidst terrifying acts, and great signs and wonders.
Deuteronomy 26:9 He led us to this very place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey—a land of abundant blessings.
Deuteronomy 26:10 Therefore, I now bring the firstfruits of the land that You, O Lord, have given me.' You shall then place them before the Lord your God, and you shall worship the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 26:11 And you shall rejoice in all the good things that the Lord your God has given to you and your household, together with the Levite and the foreign visitor who lives among you.
Deuteronomy 26:12 When you have finished setting aside the tithe of all your produce in the third year, the year of tithing, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreign visitor, the orphan, and the widow, so that they may eat within your towns and be satisfied.
Deuteronomy 26:13 Then you shall say in the presence of the Lord your God: 'I have removed the sacred portion from my house and have given it to the Levite, the foreign visitor, the orphan, and the widow, just as You commanded me. I have not violated Your commandments, nor have I forgotten Your precepts.'
Deuteronomy 26:14 I have not eaten any of it while I was in mourning, nor set aside any of it for an unclean purpose, nor offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the voice of the Lord my God and have done everything as You commanded me.
Deuteronomy 26:15 Look down from Your holy dwelling, from the exalted heavens—Your dwelling place—and bless Your people Israel, and the land You have given us, as You swore to our fathers—a land flowing with milk and honey.
Deuteronomy 26:16 Today, the Lord your God commands you to observe these statutes and ordinances. You are to keep and fulfill them with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy 26:17 Today you have declared the Lord to be your God, that you may walk in His ways, keep His rituals, and observe His statutes and ordinances, and obey His voice.
Deuteronomy 26:18 And the Lord has declared you today to be His own treasured people, just as He promised you, so that you may keep all His commandments.
Deuteronomy 26:19 and that He may set you high above all the nations He has made, for His own praise, name, and glory, and that you may be a holy people to the Lord your God, just as He has declared.

Deuteronomy 27:1 Moses and the elders of Israel gave this commandment to the people, saying, "Obey every command that I am giving to you today."
Deuteronomy 27:2 When you cross the Jordan River to enter the land that the Lord your God is giving to you, you are to set up large stones for yourselves, and you are to coat them with plaster.
Deuteronomy 27:3 And upon these stones, you are to write down all the words of this law. Do this after you have entered the land that the Lord your God is giving to you—a land flowing with milk and honey, just as He swore to our ancestors.
Deuteronomy 27:4 Therefore, when you have crossed the Jordan, set up these stones—which I am commanding you today—on Mount Ebal, and you are to coat them with plaster.
Deuteronomy 27:5 And there, on Mount Ebal, you are to build an altar to the Lord your God from stones that have not been cut by any iron tool.
Deuteronomy 27:6 Use stones that are naturally rough and whole. And on this altar, you are to offer burnt offerings to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 27:7 You are also to sacrifice peace offerings, and you will eat them there, celebrating in the presence of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 27:8 And you are to write clearly and legibly upon these stones all the words of this law.
Deuteronomy 27:9 Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all of Israel, saying, "Listen closely and pay attention, O Israel. Today, you have become the people of the Lord your God."
Deuteronomy 27:10 Therefore, you must keep His commandments and His sacred rituals, which I am giving to you today.
Deuteronomy 27:11 Moses also commanded the people on that very day, saying:
Deuteronomy 27:12 These tribes are to stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people once you have crossed the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
Deuteronomy 27:13 And these tribes, by contrast, are to stand on Mount Ebal to declare curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
Deuteronomy 27:14 Then the Levites are to declare this and say in a loud voice to every man of Israel:
Deuteronomy 27:15 Cursed is the man who makes an idol, whether carved or cast, an abomination to the Lord—something made by the hands of craftsmen—and then sets it up in a hidden place. And all the people are to answer and say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:16 Cursed is the one who dishonors his father or his mother. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:17 Cursed is the one who moves his neighbor's boundary marker. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:18 Cursed is the one who misleads a blind person who is lost on the road. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:19 Cursed is the one who perverts justice for a foreigner, an orphan, or a widow. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:20 Cursed is the one who sleeps with his father's wife, thereby uncovering his father's nakedness. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:21 Cursed is the one who sleeps with any animal. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:22 Cursed is the one who sleeps with his sister, whether she is his father's daughter or his mother's daughter. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:23 Cursed is the one who sleeps with his mother-in-law. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:24 Cursed is the one who secretly strikes down his neighbor. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:25 Cursed is the one who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:26 Cursed is the one who does not uphold the words of this law, nor fully carry them out through his actions. And all the people are to say, 'Amen!'
Deuteronomy 27:1 Moses and the elders of Israel then gave instructions to the people, saying, 'Keep every command that I am giving to all of you today.'
Deuteronomy 27:2 When you cross the Jordan River to enter the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, you must set up large stones for yourselves and cover them with a smooth coating of lime,
Deuteronomy 27:3 and on these stones, you are to write all the words of this law once you have crossed over, so that you may truly enter the land which the Lord your God is giving you—a land of abundance, flowing with milk and honey—just as the Lord swore to your ancestors.
Deuteronomy 27:4 Therefore, as soon as you have crossed the Jordan, you must set up these stones, which I command you today, on Mount Ebal. You shall also prepare them by covering them with lime,
Deuteronomy 27:5 and there, on Mount Ebal, you are to build an altar to the Lord your God using stones that have not been touched by any iron tool or cut into shape.
Deuteronomy 27:6 You shall build the altar of the Lord your God from these unworked, natural stones, and upon it, you will offer burnt sacrifices to the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 27:7 You will also offer peace offerings, which you will eat there, and rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 27:8 And on these stones, you shall write all the words of this law clearly and distinctly, so that everyone can read them.
Deuteronomy 27:9 Then Moses, along with the priests from the tribe of Levi, spoke to all of Israel, saying: 'Listen closely and pay attention, O Israel! For today, you have officially become the people of the Lord your God.'
Deuteronomy 27:10 Therefore, you are to keep His commandments and His ceremonies, which I am giving to you today.
Deuteronomy 27:11 Moses also commanded the people on that same day, saying:
Deuteronomy 27:12 When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
Deuteronomy 27:13 And in contrast, these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to declare curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
Deuteronomy 27:14 Then the Levites shall proclaim and declare in a loud voice to every man of Israel:
Deuteronomy 27:15 'Cursed be the man who makes a graven or molten image—an abomination to the Lord, the work of artisans' hands—and sets it up in secret.' And all the people shall respond and say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:16 'Cursed be he who treats his father or mother with contempt.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:17 'Cursed be he who moves his neighbor’s landmark or property boundary.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:18 'Cursed be he who misleads a blind person on their journey.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:19 'Cursed be he who perverts justice for the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:20 'Cursed be he who sleeps with his father’s wife, uncovering his father’s nakedness.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:21 'Cursed be he who has sexual relations with any animal.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:22 'Cursed be he who sleeps with his sister, whether his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:23 'Cursed be he who sleeps with his mother-in-law.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:24 'Cursed be he who strikes his neighbor in secret, intending harm.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:25 'Cursed be he who accepts a bribe to shed innocent blood.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 27:26 'Cursed be he who does not uphold the words of this law and fails to perform them completely.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'
Deuteronomy 28:1 If you truly listen to the voice of the Lord your God, so that you keep and obey all of His commandments which I am giving to you today, then the Lord your God will raise you higher than all the nations that are on the earth.
Deuteronomy 28:2 And all these blessings will come upon you and they will overtake you, if you actually listen to His commandments.
Deuteronomy 28:3 You will be blessed in the city, and blessed in the field.
Deuteronomy 28:4 Blessed will be the children born to you, and the produce of your land, and the offspring of your livestock: the flocks of your sheep and the herds of your cattle.
Deuteronomy 28:5 Blessed will be your storehouse and your provisions.
Deuteronomy 28:6 You will be blessed when you come in and when you go out.
Deuteronomy 28:7 The Lord will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be utterly defeated before your eyes. They will come against you on one path, but they will flee from you on seven paths, unable to stand against you.
Deuteronomy 28:8 The Lord will send His blessing upon your storehouses and upon all the work of your hands. And He will bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving to you.
Deuteronomy 28:9 The Lord will establish you for Himself as a holy people, just as He swore to you, if you truly keep the commandments of the Lord your God and walk in His ways.
Deuteronomy 28:10 And all the peoples of the earth will see that the Name of the Lord is invoked over you—meaning you belong to Him and are under His divine protection—and they will fear you.
Deuteronomy 28:11 The Lord will cause you to abound with every good thing: with children born to you, and with the offspring of your livestock, and with the produce of your land, which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to you.
Deuteronomy 28:12 The Lord will open His good treasure house, the sky, to give rain to your land in its proper season. And He will bless all the work of your hands, and you will lend to many nations, and you yourself will not need to borrow from anyone.
Deuteronomy 28:13 The Lord will make you the head and not the tail; and you will always be above, and never below, if you actually listen to the commandments of the Lord your God, which I am commanding you today, and if you keep and obey them.
Deuteronomy 28:14 And you must not turn away from the words that I am commanding you today, either to the right or to the left, so that you do not follow other gods or worship them.
Deuteronomy 28:15 But if you refuse to listen to the voice of the Lord your God, so that you keep and obey all His commandments and statutes, which I am commanding you today, then all these curses will come upon you and they will overtake you.

Deuteronomy 28:13 The Lord will make you the head and not the tail; you will always be at the top and never at the bottom. This will be true if you genuinely listen to the commandments of the Lord your God that I am giving you today, and are careful to keep and do them.
Deuteronomy 28:14 Do not turn away from any of the words I am commanding you today, either to the right or to the left, so that you do not go after other gods or worship them.

Deuteronomy 28:36 The Lord will lead you and the king you set over you to a nation that neither you nor your ancestors have known. There you will serve other gods made of wood and stone.
Deuteronomy 28:37 You will become an object of horror, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples to whom the Lord will scatter you.
Deuteronomy 28:38 You will sow much seed in your fields, but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it all.
Deuteronomy 28:39 You will plant and cultivate vineyards, but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them.

Deuteronomy 29:1 These are the words of the sacred covenant that the Lord commanded Moses to establish with the children of Israel in the land of Moab. This covenant was made in addition to the earlier one He had already established with them on Mount Horeb.
Deuteronomy 29:1 These are the terms of the covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to establish with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant He had already made with them at Mount Horeb.
Deuteronomy 29:2 Then Moses called all of Israel together and said to them: “You yourselves saw everything the Lord did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
Deuteronomy 29:3 including the great trials your eyes witnessed—the signs and the immense wonders.
Deuteronomy 29:4 But the Lord did not give you a heart that could truly understand, nor eyes that could truly see, nor ears that could truly hear, until this very day.
Deuteronomy 29:5 I led you for forty years through the desert, and your clothes did not wear out, nor did your sandals become old and worn on your feet.
Deuteronomy 29:6 You did not eat bread, nor did you drink wine or strong drink, so that you would know that I am the Lord your God.
Deuteronomy 29:7 You came to this place, and Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, came out to fight us, and we defeated them.
Deuteronomy 29:8 Then we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
Deuteronomy 29:9 Therefore, keep the words of this covenant and do them, so that you may prosper in everything you undertake.
Deuteronomy 29:10 All of you stand here today before the Lord your God: your leaders, your tribes, your elders, and your officials,
Deuteronomy 29:11 all the people of Israel, together with your wives and children, and the foreigners living among you in your camps, from those who cut wood to those who draw water.
Deuteronomy 29:12 You are here to enter into the covenant of the Lord your God, and into the oath which the Lord your God is establishing with you today.
Deuteronomy 29:13 He is doing this so that He may establish you as His own people, and that He Himself may be your God, just as He promised you, and just as He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Deuteronomy 29:14 I am not making this covenant with its oaths and confirmations only with you who are present today,
Deuteronomy 29:15 but also with all who are present here with us and with those who are not present today, which refers to your future generations.
Deuteronomy 29:16 For you yourselves know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we passed through the midst of the nations during your journey here.
Deuteronomy 29:17 And you saw their detestable things and their idols—their wooden and stone images, and their silver and gold, which they worshipped.
Deuteronomy 29:18 Beware lest there be among you a man or woman, or a family or tribe, whose heart turns away from the Lord our God today, to go and serve the gods of those nations. Beware lest there be among you a root that sprouts forth poison and bitterness.
Deuteronomy 29:19 If anyone hears the words of this oath and then blesses himself in his own heart, saying, 'I will have peace, even though I walk according to the stubbornness of my heart'—thinking that this will allow him to remove the sin of the drunken from the thirsty, meaning, to cause others to stumble by his own sin—
Deuteronomy 29:20 then the Lord will not be willing to forgive him. Instead, the Lord's anger and jealousy will burn against that man, and all the curses written in this book will rest upon him. The Lord will utterly blot out his name from under the sky.
Deuteronomy 29:21 The Lord will set him apart for destruction from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses and oaths written in this book of the Law.
Deuteronomy 29:22 The generation to come, and the children born after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, will see the plagues of that land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it.
Deuteronomy 29:23 They will see that the whole land is sulfur and salt and burning fire, so that it cannot be sown, nor can anything sprout, nor can any plant grow in it—just like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in His fierce anger and wrath.
Deuteronomy 29:24 And all the nations will ask: 'Why did the Lord do this to this land? What is the meaning of this immense wrath and indignation of His fury?'
Deuteronomy 29:25 And they will answer: 'Because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord, which He made with their fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt;'
Deuteronomy 29:26 'and they served other gods and worshipped them—gods they did not know, and gods the Lord had not assigned to them.'
Deuteronomy 29:27 Therefore, the fierce anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book;
Deuteronomy 29:28 and He cast them out of their land in wrath, and in fierce anger, and in great indignation, and hurled them into another land, as is evident today.
Deuteronomy 29:29 The secret things belong to the Lord our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, so that we may carry out all the words of this Law.
Deuteronomy 29:30 When all these words that are written—both the blessing and the curse—come upon you, and you reflect on them in your heart among all the nations where the Lord your God has scattered you,
Deuteronomy 29:31 and when you return to Him and obey His commands, just as I am commanding you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul:
Deuteronomy 29:32 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you. He will gather you again from all the peoples among whom He had scattered you.
Deuteronomy 29:33 Even if you have been dispersed to the farthest reaches under the sky, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back.
Deuteronomy 29:34 He will bring you into the land that your fathers possessed, and you will possess it. And He will bless you and make you more numerous than your fathers were.
Deuteronomy 29:35 The Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, so that you may love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.
Deuteronomy 29:36 And the Lord will turn all these curses upon your enemies and upon those who hate you and persecute you.
Deuteronomy 29:37 But you will return, and you will listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and you will do all the commands that I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy 29:38 And the Lord your God will make you abound in prosperity in all the work of your hands, and in the offspring of your body, and in the produce of your livestock, and in the fruitfulness of your land, and in the abundance of all your possessions. For the Lord will again delight in you for all good things, just as He delighted in your fathers.
Deuteronomy 29:39 This will happen, however, only if you listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and keep His commands and His ceremonies which are written in this Law, and if you return to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy 29:40 For this commandment which I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it far away, nor is it impossible.
Deuteronomy 30:1 Therefore, when all these words come upon you—all the blessings and all the curses which I have placed before you—and you then seriously consider them in your heart, while you are among all the nations where the Lord your God has scattered you,
Deuteronomy 30:2 and when you have returned to the Lord your God, and have obeyed His commandment with your entire being, just as I am commanding you today—both you and your children—with all your heart and with all your soul,
Deuteronomy 30:3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes, and He will have compassion on you. He will gather you again from all the nations among whom He previously scattered you.
Deuteronomy 30:4 Even if you have been scattered to the farthest ends of the world, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back.
Deuteronomy 30:5 He will bring you back into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will own it once again. You will be more prosperous and more numerous than your ancestors ever were.
Deuteronomy 30:6 The Lord your God will circumcise your heart, and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, in order that you may truly live.
Deuteronomy 30:7 Then all these curses will turn upon your enemies, and upon those who hate you and persecute you.
Deuteronomy 30:8 But you will return and listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and you will carry out all the commandments that I am giving you today.
Deuteronomy 30:9 And the Lord your God will make you abound in every work of your hands: in the children of your womb, in the offspring of your livestock, and in the abundance of your land, as well as in the generosity of all things.
Deuteronomy 30:10 For the Lord will delight again over you for your good, just as He delighted over your ancestors,
Deuteronomy 30:11 if only you listen to the voice of the Lord your God and keep His commandments and His ceremonies, which are written in this law, and you return to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Deuteronomy 30:12 For this commandment that I am giving you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it far away. It is not in the sky, so that you should have to say, "Who among us can ascend to the sky for us, and bring it down to us, so that we may hear it and do it?"
Deuteronomy 30:13 Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you should complain and say, "Who among us can cross the sea for us, and bring it to us, so that we may hear it and do it?"
Deuteronomy 30:14 Instead, the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may do it.
Deuteronomy 30:15 Consider that today I have set before you life and good, and conversely, death and evil.
Deuteronomy 30:16 This choice is so that you may love the Lord your God, and walk in His ways, and keep His commandments, ceremonies, and judgments, so that you may live and multiply. And He will bless you in the land that you are entering to possess.
Deuteronomy 30:17 But if your heart turns away, and you refuse to listen, but instead are deceived by error to worship foreign gods and serve them,
Deuteronomy 30:18 then I declare to you today that you will surely perish. You will not remain for long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.
Deuteronomy 30:19 I call the universe and the earth as witnesses against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse.
Deuteronomy 30:20 Therefore, choose life, so that both you and your descendants may live. And this means you must love the Lord your God, obey His voice, and cling to Him. For He Himself is your life and the length of your days, so that you may dwell in the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—to give to them.
Deuteronomy 31:1 Moses went and spoke all these words to all of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:2 And he said to them: "I am one hundred and twenty years old today. I cannot lead you anymore, and the Lord has told me, 'You will not cross this Jordan River.'"
Deuteronomy 31:3 "The Lord your God Himself will go before you. He will destroy these nations in your sight, and you will take possession of their land. And this Joshua will go before you, just as the Lord has commanded."
Deuteronomy 31:4 "And the Lord will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to all their lands, which He utterly destroyed."
Deuteronomy 31:5 "Therefore, when He has destroyed even these nations and delivered them over to you, you will do to them exactly as I have commanded you."
Deuteronomy 31:6 "Be strong and courageous. Do not fear them, nor be terrified by their presence, because the Lord your God Himself is your leader. He will not abandon you, nor will He ever forsake you."
Deuteronomy 31:7 Moses then called Joshua and said to him in front of all Israel: "Be strong and courageous, for you will lead this people into the land that the Lord swore to their fathers to give them. And you will divide it among them by lot."
Deuteronomy 31:8 "And the Lord, who is your leader, He Himself will be with you. He will not abandon you, nor will He ever forsake you. Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed."
Deuteronomy 31:9 So Moses wrote down this entire law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:10 He then commanded them, saying: "At the end of every seven years, in the year of release, during the Feast of Tabernacles—which is the time of the Sabbatical year—"
Deuteronomy 31:11 "When all of Israel gathers to appear before the Lord your God in the holy place He chooses, you shall read the words of this entire law before all of Israel, with everyone listening intently."
Deuteronomy 31:12 "Gather the people: men, women, children, and the foreigners living within your towns—so that they may listen, learn, and fear the Lord your God, and diligently observe all the words of this law, carrying them out in their actions."
Deuteronomy 31:13 "And their children, who do not yet know the Law, may hear it and learn to fear the Lord your God all the days you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to inhabit."
Deuteronomy 31:14 The Lord then said to Moses: "Look, the days of your death are near. Call Joshua, and stand with him in the Tent of Meeting—the Tabernacle of Testimony—so that I may give him his charge." So Moses and Joshua went and stood inside the Tent of Meeting.
Deuteronomy 31:15 And the Lord appeared there in a pillar of cloud, which stood directly over the entrance of the Tabernacle.
Deuteronomy 31:16 The Lord then said to Moses: "Behold, you will soon lie down with your fathers in death. And this people, when they settle in the land they are about to enter, will rise up and commit spiritual adultery by pursuing foreign gods. They will abandon Me there and break the covenant I have made with them."
Deuteronomy 31:17 "And My wrath will burn fiercely against them on that day. I will abandon them and hide My face from them, and they will be utterly consumed. All sorts of evils and afflictions will find them, so that on that day, they will say: 'Surely, because God is not with me, these evils have come upon me.'"
Deuteronomy 31:18 "But I will certainly hide My face from them on that day because of all the evils they have committed, for they will have pursued foreign gods."
Deuteronomy 31:19 "Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Have them memorize it and sing it, so that this song may serve as a perpetual witness for Me against the children of Israel."
Deuteronomy 31:20 "For I will bring them into the land which I swore to their fathers—a land flowing with milk and honey. They will eat, be satisfied, and grow prosperous. But then they will turn to foreign gods and serve them. They will invalidate My covenant and mock it."
Deuteronomy 31:21 "And when many evils and afflictions find them, this song will stand as a witness against them, for it will reveal their inner thoughts and what they were planning even before it happened. For I know their intentions, even now, while they are still living in the desert land."
Deuteronomy 31:22 So Moses wrote that song on that very day and taught it to the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:23 And He—the Lord—gave a charge to Joshua, the son of Nun, saying: "Be strong and courageous, for you will lead the children of Israel into the land which I promised them by oath, and I will be with you."
Deuteronomy 31:24 Therefore, after Moses had finished writing all the words of this entire law in a scroll,
Deuteronomy 31:25 He commanded the Levites, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying:
Deuteronomy 31:26 "Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you."
Deuteronomy 31:27 "For I know your stubbornness and your hard-headed obstinacy. Even while I am still alive and walking among you, you have always been contentious against the Lord. How much more rebellious will you be after I am dead!"
Deuteronomy 31:28 "Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I may speak these words in the hearing of everyone, and call the sky and the earth to witness against them."
Deuteronomy 31:29 "For I know that after my death, you will act wickedly and quickly turn aside from the path that I have commanded you. And evils will certainly befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the work of your own hands—your idols."
Deuteronomy 31:30 So Moses spoke the words of this song in the hearing of the entire assembly of Israel, and he completed it fully.
Deuteronomy 31:1 And Moses went, and he spoke all these words to the whole nation of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:2 He said to them, 'I am one hundred and twenty years old today, and I can no longer lead you out or bring you in, especially since the Lord has already told me that I will not cross this Jordan River.'
Deuteronomy 31:3 So the Lord your God Himself will go across before you, and He Himself will destroy all these nations in front of you so that you can take possession of their lands. And Joshua, here, will cross over ahead of you, just as the Lord has promised.
Deuteronomy 31:4 And the Lord will deal with these nations just as He dealt with Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and with all of their land, whom He utterly destroyed.
Deuteronomy 31:5 Therefore, when He delivers even these nations to you, you shall do to them just as I have commanded you.
Deuteronomy 31:6 Be strong and take courage! Do not be afraid, nor be terrified by their armies, because the Lord your God Himself is your leader. He will not leave you, nor will He ever abandon you.
Deuteronomy 31:7 Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, 'Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring this people into the land that the Lord swore to their fathers that He would give them, and you shall divide it among them by lot.'
Deuteronomy 31:8 And the Lord, who is your leader, He Himself will go before you. He Himself will accomplish this task, and He will not leave you nor abandon you. Do not be afraid, nor be terrified.
Deuteronomy 31:9 So Moses wrote this entire Law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:10 And he commanded them, saying, 'After every seven years, in the year of remission —the year of release from debts—, during the Feast of Tabernacles,'
Deuteronomy 31:11 'When all of Israel comes to appear before the presence of the Lord your God in the specific place that the Lord will choose, you shall read this entire Law aloud for all of Israel to hear.'
Deuteronomy 31:12 'Gather the people—men, women, children, and the foreigners who live within your towns—so that they may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, and carefully observe all the words of this Law.'
Deuteronomy 31:13 'And so that their children, who have not yet learned the Law, may hear it and learn to fear the Lord your God all the days you live in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.'
Deuteronomy 31:14 Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Behold, the days of your death are near. Call Joshua, and both of you present yourselves in the Tent of Testimony so that I may give him commands.'
Deuteronomy 31:15 So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the Tent of Testimony.
Deuteronomy 31:16 And the Lord appeared there in a pillar of cloud, which stood over the entrance of the Tent of Testimony.
Deuteronomy 31:17 Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Behold, you are about to die and join your fathers. And this people will then rise up and commit spiritual fornication by chasing after foreign gods in the land they are entering to inhabit. They will abandon Me and break the covenant that I have made with them.'
Deuteronomy 31:18 And My furious anger will be kindled against them on that day. I will abandon them and hide My face from them, and they will become prey. Many evils and afflictions will befall them, so much so that they will say on that day, 'Surely these evils have befallen me because God is not with me.'
Deuteronomy 31:19 Now therefore, write this song for yourselves and teach it to the children of Israel, so that they may remember it and sing it, and so that this song may serve as a witness for Me against the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:20 For when they enter the land that I swore to their fathers—a land flowing with milk and honey—and they eat, become full, and grow prosperous, they will then abandon the Lord their God and break His covenant.
Deuteronomy 31:21 And when such a multitude of evils and afflictions befalls them, then the testimony of this song will serve as a reminder to them. For I truly know their thoughts, which are even now present in their hearts, even before I bring them into the land which I promised to many with an oath.
Deuteronomy 31:22 So Moses wrote down the song and taught it to the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 31:23 And He —God— commanded Joshua, the son of Nun, and said, 'Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land that I swore to give them, and I will be with you.'
Deuteronomy 31:24 So after Moses finished writing all the words of this Law in a scroll,
Deuteronomy 31:25 he gave a command to the Levites, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, saying:
Deuteronomy 31:26 'Take this book of the Law and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you.'
Deuteronomy 31:27 'For I know your obstinacy and your extreme stubbornness. Even while I am still alive with you today, you have always acted rebelliously against the Lord. How much more will you do so when I am dead?'
Deuteronomy 31:28 'Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and I will call the universe and the earth to witness against them.'
Deuteronomy 31:29 'For I know that after my death you will act wickedly and quickly turn aside from the path that I commanded you. And evils will surely befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord and provoke Him to anger through the idols that you have made with your own hands.'
Deuteronomy 31:30 So Moses spoke the words of this song in the hearing of the entire assembly of Israel, and he completed it even to the end.
Deuteronomy 32:1 O you heavens, hear what I am about to say. Let the entire earth listen to the words from My mouth.
Deuteronomy 32:2 May My teaching pour down like the rain, refreshing and abundant. May My words flow gently like the dew. May it be like a heavy shower upon tender plants, and like drops upon the green grass.
Deuteronomy 32:3 For I will proclaim the Name of the Lord. Ascribe greatness to our God!
Deuteronomy 32:4 God's works are perfect, and all His ways are just judgments. He is a faithful God, without any iniquity—He is righteous and upright.
Deuteronomy 32:5 They have sinned against Him, and they are not His pure children, but rather a wicked and perverse generation.
Deuteronomy 32:6 Is this how you repay the Lord, you foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who possesses you, who made you, and who formed you?
Deuteronomy 32:7 Remember the ancient days, consider each past generation. Ask your father, and he will tell you; ask your elders, and they will explain it to you.
Deuteronomy 32:8 When the Most High divided the nations, when He separated the descendants of Adam, He set the boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 32:9 For the Lord's portion is His people: Jacob is the designated portion of His inheritance.
Deuteronomy 32:10 He found him in a deserted land, in a place of horror and vast wilderness. He led him around, and taught him, and guarded him like the pupil of His own eye.
Deuteronomy 32:11 Like an eagle that stirs its young to fly, hovering over them, it spreads its wings, takes them up, and carries them on its shoulders.
Deuteronomy 32:12 The Lord alone was his guide; and there was no foreign god with him.
Deuteronomy 32:13 He established him on the high land, so that he might eat the fruits of the fields, so that he might draw honey from the rock, and oil from the hardest stone.
Deuteronomy 32:14 He provided butter from the herd, and milk from the sheep, with the fat of lambs and rams of Bashan, and goats, with the finest wheat. And he drank the pure blood of the grape, the most unmixed wine.
Deuteronomy 32:15 But the Beloved grew fat and kicked back against Him. He grew fat, became plump, and became broad. He abandoned God, his Maker, and departed from God, his Savior.
Deuteronomy 32:16 They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods, and they stirred Him to anger with their abominations.
Deuteronomy 32:17 They sacrificed to demons, and not to God—to gods they did not know. They were new, recently introduced gods, whom their fathers had not worshipped.
Deuteronomy 32:18 You have forsaken God who begot you, and you have forgotten the Lord, your Creator.
Deuteronomy 32:19 The Lord saw this, and He was provoked to anger, because His sons and His daughters provoked Him.
Deuteronomy 32:20 And He said: 'I will hide My face from them, and I will see what their end will be. For they are a perverse generation, and children who are unfaithful.'
Deuteronomy 32:21 They provoked Me with what was not God, and they roused Me to anger with their worthless idols. So I will provoke them with what is not a people, and I will irritate them with a foolish nation.
Deuteronomy 32:22 For a fire has been kindled by My wrath, and it will burn to the lowest depths of hell itself. It will devour the earth with its harvest, and consume the very foundations of the mountains.
Deuteronomy 32:23 I will heap evils upon them, and I will exhaust My arrows against them.
Deuteronomy 32:24 They will be consumed by hunger, and the birds of prey will devour them with the bitterest bite. I will send against them the teeth of wild beasts, with the fury of creeping things that crawl upon the earth.
Deuteronomy 32:25 Outside, the sword will bring desolation, and inside, terror. Both young men and virgins, infants and old men alike, will perish.
Deuteronomy 32:26 And I said: 'Where is their offspring? I will cause their memory to cease from among men.'
Deuteronomy 32:27 But I postponed it because of the wrath of their enemies, lest their foes become arrogant and say: 'Our hand is mighty, and it was not the Lord who did all these things.'
Deuteronomy 32:28 For they are a nation without counsel and without understanding.
Deuteronomy 32:29 Oh, that they were wise, that they understood, and that they would foresee their latter end!
Deuteronomy 32:30 How could one man pursue a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their God had sold them off, and the Lord had shut them up?
Deuteronomy 32:31 For their god is not like our God—even our enemies judge this to be true.
Deuteronomy 32:32 Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters are most bitter.
Deuteronomy 32:33 Their wine is the venom of dragons, and the incurable poison of asps.
Deuteronomy 32:34 Are not these things stored up with Me, and sealed in My treasuries?
Deuteronomy 32:35 Vengeance belongs to Me, and I will repay them in due time, when their foot slips. The day of their destruction is near, and their appointed times hasten to come.
Deuteronomy 32:36 For the Lord will judge His people, and He will have compassion on His servants. He will see that their power is weakened, and that those who were imprisoned have failed, and that the remaining ones have been consumed.
Deuteronomy 32:37 And He will say: 'Where are their gods, in whom they placed their trust?'
Deuteronomy 32:38 'Those who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their libations, let them arise and help you! Let them protect you in your time of need!'
Deuteronomy 32:39 See now that I alone am He, and there is no other God besides Me. I kill, and I make alive. I strike, and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of My hand.
Deuteronomy 32:40 I will lift My hand to the heavens and declare: 'As I live forever!'
Deuteronomy 32:1 Listen, you created universe, to what I speak. Let the earth hear the words that come from My mouth.
Deuteronomy 32:2 Let My teaching be absorbed like gentle rain, and My words distill like dew, like showers upon the tender grass, and like drops upon the growing plants.
Deuteronomy 32:3 For I will proclaim the name of the Lord God. Therefore, give all glory and majesty to our God!
Deuteronomy 32:4 All of God’s works are perfect, and all of His ways are just. God is faithful and without any evil; He is righteous and upright.
Deuteronomy 32:5 They have sinned against Him, and are not truly His children, but instead are stained by their perversity: a generation that is crooked and twisted.
Deuteronomy 32:6 Is this how you repay the Lord, you foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who possesses you, and made you, and created you into existence?
Deuteronomy 32:7 Remember the days of old. Consider each generation, one after another. Ask your father, and he will tell you. Ask your elders, and they will explain it to you.
Deuteronomy 32:8 When the Most High God divided the nations, when He separated the children of Adam, He established the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.
Deuteronomy 32:9 For the Lord’s portion is His people; Jacob is the measuring line of His inheritance.
Deuteronomy 32:10 He found them in a desert land, in a place of terrifying emptiness and vast desolation. He surrounded them and taught them, and He guarded them as the apple of His eye.
Deuteronomy 32:11 Like an eagle stirring up its nest, teaching its young to fly, hovering over them, it spreads its wings, takes them up, and carries them on its shoulders.
Deuteronomy 32:12 The Lord alone was their leader, and there was no foreign god with them.
Deuteronomy 32:13 He set them on the high places of the earth so that they might eat the produce of the fields, and that they might suck honey from the rock, and oil from the hardest stone.
Deuteronomy 32:14 He gave them butter from the herd, and milk from the sheep, with the fat of lambs and rams from Bashan, and goats, with the finest wheat marrow. They drank the purest blood of the grape, which is wine.
Deuteronomy 32:15 But My beloved Israel grew fat and kicked against Me! Having grown fat, being well-fed, and expanding in prosperity, they abandoned God their Maker and turned away from God their Savior.
Deuteronomy 32:16 They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods, and they stirred Him to anger with their abominations.
Deuteronomy 32:17 They sacrificed to demons, not to God—to gods they did not know, newly arrived ones, recently come into being, whom their fathers had not worshipped.
Deuteronomy 32:18 You forgot God, who gave birth to you; you forgot the Lord, your Creator.
Deuteronomy 32:19 The Lord saw this, and He was moved to anger, because His sons and daughters provoked Him.
Deuteronomy 32:20 And He said: 'I will hide My face from them, and I will see what their end will be. For they are a perverse generation, and they are unfaithful children.'
Deuteronomy 32:21 They provoked Me to jealousy with that which was not God, and they angered Me with their empty idols. So I will provoke them with a people who are not a people, and I will anger them with a foolish nation.
Deuteronomy 32:22 For a fire has been kindled in My wrath, and it will burn to the lowest depths of hell. It will devour the earth with its harvest, and it will consume the foundations of the mountains.
Deuteronomy 32:23 I will heap evils upon them, and I will exhaust My arrows against them.
Deuteronomy 32:24 They will be consumed by famine, and birds will devour them with the bitterest bite. I will send the teeth of wild beasts among them, with the furious venom of creeping things upon the earth, even serpents.
Deuteronomy 32:25 Outside, the sword will destroy them, and inside, terror will consume them—both young men and virgins, infants with old men.
Deuteronomy 32:26 And I said: 'Where are they now? I will make their memory cease from among humanity.'
Deuteronomy 32:27 But I held back My judgment because of the anger of their enemies, lest the adversaries become arrogant and say: 'Our own powerful hand did all this, and not the Lord.'
Deuteronomy 32:28 For they are a nation without counsel and without understanding.
Deuteronomy 32:29 If only they were wise, and understood, and would consider their latter end!
Deuteronomy 32:30 How could one man pursue a thousand, and two men put ten thousand to flight? Is it not because their God has sold them, and the Lord has delivered them up?
Deuteronomy 32:31 For their gods are not like our God; even our enemies themselves are witnesses of this.
Deuteronomy 32:32 For their vine is from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of bitterness, and their clusters are most bitter.
Deuteronomy 32:33 Their wine is the venom of dragons, and the incurable poison of vipers.
Deuteronomy 32:34 Are not these things stored up with Me, and sealed in My treasures?
Deuteronomy 32:35 Vengeance belongs to Me, and I will repay them in due time, when their foot slips. For the day of their destruction is near, and the appointed times are hastening to come.
Deuteronomy 32:36 For the Lord will judge His people, and He will have compassion on His servants when He sees that their power is gone, and that both the imprisoned and the free have vanished and are consumed.
Deuteronomy 32:37 And He will say: 'Where are their gods, in whom they placed their trust?'
Deuteronomy 32:38 Those who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their libations: 'Let them arise and help you, and protect you in your time of need!'
Deuteronomy 32:39 See now that I alone am God, and there is no other God besides Me. I kill, and I make alive. I wound, and I heal. And there is no one who can rescue from My hand.
Deuteronomy 32:40 For I will lift My hand to the created universe and declare: 'As I live forever!'
Deuteronomy 33:1 This is the final blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave to the children of Israel just before his death.
Deuteronomy 33:2 And Moses said: "The Lord God came from Mount Sinai—the place of the Law—and dawned upon us from Mount Seir, and revealed Himself from Mount Paran, bringing with Him thousands of His holy angels.
Deuteronomy 33:3 Truly, He loved His people Israel. All of His holy ones are in His powerful hand, and those who approach Him and follow His ways will receive His divine teaching.
Deuteronomy 33:4 Moses gave us the Law—His divine instruction—as a spiritual inheritance for all the descendants of Jacob.
Deuteronomy 33:5 And there will be a King among the upright people of Israel when the leaders of the tribes gather together.
Deuteronomy 33:6 Moses blessed the tribe of Reuben: "May Reuben live and not perish, even if their numbers remain small among the other tribes."
Deuteronomy 33:7 And this is the blessing for Judah: "Hear, O Lord, the plea of Judah, and bring him back to his people after battle. Let his hands fight powerfully for him, and may You be his helper against all his enemies."
Deuteronomy 33:8 And to Levi, Moses said: "Your spiritual perfection and Your divine teaching belong to Your holy man—the high priest—whom You tested during trials and judged at the waters of Meribah, where the people contended against You."
Deuteronomy 33:9 "The Levites, for Your sake, were willing to disregard their own father and mother, and to disown their own brothers. They did this because they guarded Your holy words and diligently kept Your covenant."
Deuteronomy 33:10 "They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Law to Israel. They will offer incense as a pleasing aroma when Your presence is manifested, and they will offer burnt offerings on Your altar."
Deuteronomy 33:11 "Bless, O Lord, the strength of the tribe of Levi, and accept the sacred works of their hands. Strike down their enemies so they may never rise against them again."
Deuteronomy 33:12 And to Benjamin, Moses said: "The beloved of the Lord shall dwell securely in His presence. He will remain there as in a sacred chamber all the day, and the Lord will rest between his shoulders, protecting him."
Deuteronomy 33:13 And to Joseph, Moses said: "May his land be blessed by the Lord, producing fruit from the heavens—from the rains and the dew—and from the deep waters that lie beneath the earth."
Deuteronomy 33:14 "May his land be blessed with the finest fruits ripened by the sun and the moon, with the choicest produce from the ancient mountains and the fruit of the everlasting hills."
Deuteronomy 33:15 "May the blessing of Him who appeared in the burning bush come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of him who was set apart from his brothers—meaning Jacob's favored son."
Deuteronomy 33:16 "His glory is like the firstborn bull, his horns are like the horns of a wild ox. With them he shall push the nations to the ends of the earth. These are the thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh—Joseph's two tribes."
Deuteronomy 33:17 And to Zebulun, Moses said: "Rejoice, Zebulun, as you go out for commerce, and rejoice, Issachar, in your settled dwelling places."
Deuteronomy 33:18 "They will summon peoples to the sacred mountain to offer sacrifices of righteousness there. For they will draw from the abundance of the seas as if it were milk, and discover the hidden treasures buried in the sand—resources from the coast."
Deuteronomy 33:19 And to Gad, Moses said: "Blessed is he who enlarges Gad's territory! He lies down like a lion, ready to seize his prey—both arm and crown—from his enemies."
Deuteronomy 33:20 "He chose his own best portion of land, for there a leader's share was reserved for him. He marched with the chiefs of the people. He executed the Lord God's justice for Israel and His righteous decrees with Him, joining his forces with the thousands of the other tribes."
Deuteronomy 33:21 And to Dan, Moses said: "Dan is a young lion, a lion's cub springing forth from Bashan."
Deuteronomy 33:22 And to Naphtali, Moses said: "Naphtali is abundantly satisfied with the Lord's favor and full of His blessing. He will possess the coastal region to the south."
Deuteronomy 33:23 And to Asher, Moses said: "Blessed be Asher above all sons! May he be favored by his brothers, and may he dip his foot in oil—symbolizing abundant olive oil from his land."
Deuteronomy 33:24 "His shoes will be made of iron and bronze, providing strength. As your days of youth are, so shall your days of old age be—full of vigor and blessing."
Deuteronomy 33:25 There is no God like the God of Israel, who rides across the universe to come to your aid, majestic in His clouds.
Deuteronomy 33:26 His dwelling is in the highest heavens, and His everlasting arms support you from beneath. He drove out your enemy before you and commanded, 'Destroy them!'
Deuteronomy 33:27 So Israel dwelt securely, alone and without fear. The fountain of Jacob—meaning his descendants—lived in a land of grain and new wine, and the skies above watered it with dew.
Deuteronomy 33:28 Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord God? He is the shield of your help and the sword of your glory. Your enemies will deny your power, but you will tread upon their necks.
Deuteronomy 34:1 Moses then went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. The Lord showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan,
Deuteronomy 34:2 all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, stretching as far as the western sea, which is the Mediterranean.
Deuteronomy 34:3 and the southern region of the land, along with the whole plain of Jericho, known as the city of palm trees, stretching all the way to Zoar.
Deuteronomy 34:4 The Lord then said to him: "This is the land that I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that I would give to their descendants. You have seen it with your own eyes, but you will not cross over into it."
Deuteronomy 34:5 So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab, in obedience to the Lord's command.
Deuteronomy 34:6 And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor. No one knows the exact location of his burial place to this very day.
Deuteronomy 34:7 Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyesight had not dimmed, nor had his physical strength diminished.
Deuteronomy 34:8 The children of Israel mourned for him in the plains of Moab for thirty days, and the days of mourning and lamentation for Moses were thus completed.
Deuteronomy 34:9 Joshua, the son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands upon him. The children of Israel obeyed him, doing exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Deuteronomy 34:10 And there has not arisen a prophet in Israel since like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face—meaning, in intimate, direct communication.
Deuteronomy 34:11 This refers to all the miraculous signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, against all his servants, and against all his land.
Deuteronomy 34:12 It also refers to the entire display of God's strong hand and the great and terrible things that Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
Joshua 1:1 Now, it came to pass that after the death of Moses, the servant of God, God spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, who had been Moses' assistant, saying:
Joshua 1:2 My servant Moses is dead. Now, you and all the people with you must get up and cross this Jordan River into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel.
Joshua 1:3 Every single place that your foot steps upon, I will give to you, just as I promised Moses.
Joshua 1:4 From the desert and from Lebanon, stretching all the way to the great Euphrates River—all the land of the Hittites, all the way to the Great Sea in the west—that will be your territory's boundary.
Joshua 1:5 No one will be able to stand against you throughout your entire life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not abandon you, nor will I ever desert you.
Joshua 1:6 Be strong and courageous! For you are the one who will divide by lot this land among this people—the land which I swore to their ancestors I would give to them.
Joshua 1:7 Only be very strong and very courageous! So that you carefully observe and faithfully do everything in the entire Law that My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it, neither to the right nor to the left, so that you may act wisely in everything you do.
Joshua 1:8 Do not let this Book of the Law ever depart from your mouth. Instead, meditate on it day and night, so that you may diligently observe and do everything that is written in it. Then you will make your way prosperous, and you will understand and succeed.
Joshua 1:9 Listen! I am commanding you right now: Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid, and do not be terrified! Because the Lord your God is with you everywhere you go, no matter what you face.
Joshua 1:10 And Joshua then gave orders to the leaders of the people, saying:
Joshua 1:11 Go through the camp and command the people, saying: 'Prepare your provisions, because after three days, you will cross the Jordan River and go in to take possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving to you.'
Joshua 1:12 Joshua also spoke to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh,
Joshua 1:13 Remember the word that Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you, saying: 'The Lord your God has given you rest and this entire land.'
Joshua 1:14 Your wives, your children, and your livestock will remain in the land that Moses gave to you beyond the Jordan River. But all of you, every strong, armed man, will cross over ahead of your brothers, fully equipped for battle, and you will help them,
Joshua 1:15 until the Lord gives rest to your brothers, just as He has given it to you, and they themselves take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving to them. Then you may return to your own land, the land of your inheritance, and settle there, the land which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave to you beyond the Jordan River, on the east side.
Joshua 1:16 And they responded to Joshua, saying: 'We will do everything that you have commanded us, and wherever you send us, we will go.
Joshua 1:17 Just as we obeyed Moses in everything, so we will also obey you. Only let the Lord your God be with you, just as He was with Moses.
Joshua 1:18 Anyone who rebels against your authority and does not obey all the words that you command him will be put to death. Only you must be strong and act with courage.
Joshua 2:1 So Joshua, the son of Nun, sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies. He commanded them: "Go and observe the land, especially the city of Jericho." The two men departed and entered the house of a harlot named Rahab, and they lodged there.
Joshua 2:2 It was reported to the king of Jericho, with the message: "Look, some men from the children of Israel have entered this place tonight to spy out the land."
Joshua 2:3 So the king of Jericho sent a message to Rahab, saying: "Bring out the men who have entered your house, because they are spies, and they have come to survey all the land."
Joshua 2:4 The woman, however, had taken the men and hidden them. She then spoke this way: "Indeed, men came to me, but I did not know from where they were coming."
Joshua 2:5 When the city gates were about to be closed in the dark, they left. I do not know where they went. Pursue them quickly, and you will surely overtake them.'"
Joshua 2:6 She, however, had made the men go up to the roof of her house and hidden them under stalks of flax.
Joshua 2:7 Indeed, those who had been sent by the king pursued them along the road that leads to the Jordan, all the way to the fords. As soon as the pursuers went out, the city gates were immediately closed.
Joshua 2:8 But before the spies lay down to sleep, Rahab went up to them on the roof and said:
Joshua 2:9 "I know that the Lord God has given you this land, and that your terror has fallen upon us. Indeed, a great fear of you has seized all the inhabitants of these lands."
Joshua 2:10 "We have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt. We also heard what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, who were on the other side of the Jordan, whom you utterly destroyed."
Joshua 2:11 "And from that moment, no courage has remained within us, because we were terrified by your impending arrival. For the Lord your God, He alone is God in the universe above and on the earth below."
Joshua 2:12 "Now therefore, swear to me by the Lord that just as I have shown kindness to you, so also you will show kindness to my father's household. And give me a sure sign, a true promise,"
Joshua 2:13 "—that you will save my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that belongs to them, and that you will deliver our lives from death."
Joshua 2:14 The men answered her: "Our lives for yours, even unto death, if you do not betray this matter of ours. When the Lord delivers this land to us, we will show you kindness and faithfulness."
Joshua 2:15 Then she let them down by a rope through the window, because her house was built into the city wall, and she lived in the wall itself.
Joshua 2:16 And she said to them: "Go to the mountain, so that the men sent to pursue you do not encounter you. Hide there for three days until they have returned. Then, you may go on your way."
Joshua 2:17 The spies said to her: "We will be free from this oath, by which you have bound us, under certain conditions,
Joshua 2:18 —if, when we enter the land, you tie this scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down. You must also gather your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your relatives into your house."
Joshua 2:19 "If anyone goes outside the doors of your house, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be innocent. But if anyone inside the house with you is harmed, their blood will be on our heads."
Joshua 2:20 "However, if you betray this matter of ours, then we will also be free from this oath by which you have made us swear."
Joshua 2:21 She replied: "As you have spoken, so let it be." Then she sent them away, and when they had gone, she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
Joshua 2:22 The men then went to the mountain and remained there for three days, until those who had pursued them returned. For the pursuers searched along all the roads but did not find them.
Joshua 2:23 After three days, the two men returned. They descended from the mountain, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Joshua, the son of Nun. They recounted to him everything that had happened to them,
Joshua 2:24 and said: "The Lord has truly delivered all this land into our hands, for all its inhabitants are trembling in fear because of us."
Joshua 2:1 So Joshua, the son of Nun, secretly sent two men as spies from the region of Settim. He instructed them: “Go, and carefully observe the land, especially the city of Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a woman who was a harlot, named Rahab, and they stayed there with her.
Joshua 2:2 And it was reported to the king of Jericho that some men from the children of Israel had come there that night to spy out the land.
Joshua 2:3 So the king of Jericho sent a message to Rahab, saying: “Bring out the men who have entered your house, for they are spies who have come to examine the whole land.”
Joshua 2:4 But the woman took the men and hid them. She then spoke: “It is true, some men did come to me, but I did not know where they were from.
Joshua 2:5 When the city gate was about to be shut in the darkness of evening, the men left. I do not know where they went. Pursue them quickly, and you will surely overtake them.”
Joshua 2:6 Now, the woman had actually made the men go up to the roof of her house and had hidden them under stalks of flax that were laid out there.
Joshua 2:7 The king’s men went out after them on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan River. Immediately after the king’s men left, the city gate was closed.
Joshua 2:8 Before the spies lay down to sleep, Rahab went up to them on the roof and spoke, saying:
Joshua 2:9 “I know that the Lord has given this land over to you, and that our terror has fallen upon you. Indeed, the fear of you has completely disheartened all the inhabitants of this land.
Joshua 2:10 We have heard how the Lord dried up the waters of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt. We also heard what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were across the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
Joshua 2:11 Since no one else is coming into this land, we are terrified and dismayed. Indeed, the fear of you has fallen upon all its inhabitants. For the Lord your God, He is God in the sky above, and on the earth below.
Joshua 2:12 Now therefore, I ask you, swear to me by the Lord, because I have shown mercy to you, that you also will show mercy to my father’s household. Give me a sure sign—
Joshua 2:13 that you will spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death.”
Joshua 2:14 The men answered her: “May our lives be pledged for yours in death, if only you do not betray this agreement of ours. When the Lord delivers this land to us, we will show you mercy and faithfulness.”
Joshua 2:15 So she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall.
Joshua 2:16 And she said to them: “Go to the mountains, lest those who were sent to capture you might find you. Hide there for three days until they return. After that, you can go on your way.”
Joshua 2:17 The spies then said to her: “We will be released from this oath which you have made us swear,
Joshua 2:18 if, when we enter this land, you tie this scarlet rope in the window through which you let us down, and if you gather your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your relatives into your house.
Joshua 2:19 If anyone from your family ventures outside the doors of your house, his death will be his own responsibility—we will be innocent. However, if we are betrayed by you, then this word of our promise will become null and void.”
Joshua 2:20 And she answered: “May it be as you have spoken.” So she sent them away, and they left. Then she tied the scarlet rope in the window.
Joshua 2:21 So they departed and came to the mountain pass, and they remained there for three days until those who had pursued them returned. The pursuers had searched along every road, but they found nothing.
Joshua 2:22 Then the two men returned. They came down from the mountain, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Joshua, the son of Nun. They recounted to him everything that had happened to them.
Joshua 2:23 They said: “The Lord has indeed delivered all the land into our hands! And all its inhabitants are terrified with fear of us.”
Joshua 2:24 They declared: “The Lord has truly given all the land into our hands, for all its inhabitants are utterly demoralized by the fear of us.”
Joshua 3:1 Joshua rose from sleep during the night and moved the camp from Shittim. He, along with all the children of Israel, came to the Jordan River, and they remained there for three days, waiting to begin their crossing.
Joshua 3:2 After three days, officials went throughout the camp,
Joshua 3:3 and commanded them, saying: 'When you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, carried by the priests from the tribe of Levi, you also must get up and follow in their footsteps.'
Joshua 3:4 'But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits (which is roughly half a mile) between yourselves and the Ark. This way you can see it from afar and know by which path you should go, because you have never passed this way before.'
Joshua 3:5 Then Joshua said to the people: 'Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will perform wonders among you.'
Joshua 3:6 And he said to the priests: 'Take up the Ark of the Covenant and go before the people.' So they took it up, as commanded, and carried it.
Joshua 3:7 Then the Lord said to Joshua: 'Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.'
Joshua 3:8 'You, therefore, command the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant and tell them: 'When you step into the edge of the water of the Jordan, stand still in the Jordan River.''
Joshua 3:9 Then Joshua said to the children of Israel: 'Come here, and listen to the words of the Lord your God.'
Joshua 3:10 And again he said: 'By this you shall know that the Lord, the living God, is among you, and that He will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites.'
Joshua 3:11 'Behold, the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go before you through the Jordan River.'
Joshua 3:12 'Now therefore, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.'
Joshua 3:13 'And when the feet of the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth touch the waters of the Jordan, the waters that flow downstream will be cut off and will fail. But the waters coming down from upstream will stand still, gathering into a single heap.'
Joshua 3:14 So the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, and the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant went before them.
Joshua 3:15 When they had come as far as the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who carried the Ark were dipped into the very edge of the water (for the Jordan River at that time overflowed all its banks during the season of the wheat harvest),
Joshua 3:16 the waters flowing downstream stood still in one place, rising up like a mountain, far away at the city of Adam, which is on the side of Zaretan. And those waters that flowed further down toward the Dead Sea, which is the Salt Sea, completely drained away.
Joshua 3:17 Meanwhile, the people crossed over opposite Jericho. And the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River, while all the people passed over on the dry riverbed, until everyone had crossed the Jordan.
Joshua 3:18 When everyone had completely crossed over, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying:
Joshua 3:19 'Choose twelve men, one from each tribe,'
Joshua 3:20 'and command them to take twelve very hard stones from the middle of the Jordan Riverbed, from the very place where the priests' feet stood. You shall place these stones in the location of the camp where you are going to pitch your tents tonight.'
Joshua 3:21 So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had chosen from the children of Israel, one from each tribe,
Joshua 3:22 and he said to them: 'Go before the Ark of the Lord your God to the middle of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on your shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel,
Joshua 3:23 'Let this be a sign among you. And when your children ask you tomorrow, saying, 'What do these stones mean?'
Joshua 3:24 'then you shall tell them: 'The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it crossed over. For this reason these stones are set as a memorial for the children of Israel forever.''
Joshua 3:25 So the children of Israel did just as Joshua commanded. They carried twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan Riverbed, just as the Lord had told him, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, to the place where they had pitched their camp. There they set them down.
Joshua 3:26 Joshua also set up another twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan Riverbed, where the feet of the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant had stood. And those stones are there to this very day.
Joshua 3:27 Meanwhile, the priests who carried the Ark stood in the middle of the Jordan Riverbed until everything was completed that Joshua had commanded the people to do, speaking on behalf of the Lord. And the people hurried to cross over.
Joshua 3:28 When everyone had crossed over, then the Ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over ahead of the people.
Joshua 3:29 The sons of Reuben, and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, armed for battle, marched ahead of the children of Israel, just as Moses had commanded them.
Joshua 3:30 About forty thousand armed warriors, ready for battle, crossed over onto the plains of the city of Jericho.
Joshua 3:31 On that day, the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, so that they feared him just as they had feared Moses, for all the days of Joshua's life.
Joshua 3:32 And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying:
Joshua 3:33 'Command the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant to come up out of the Jordan River.'
Joshua 3:34 So Joshua commanded the priests, saying: 'Come up out of the Jordan River!'
Joshua 3:35 As the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came up, and as soon as the soles of their feet touched the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their channel and flowed as they did before, overflowing all their banks.
Joshua 3:36 The people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal, on the eastern border of Jericho.
Joshua 3:37 And the twelve stones, which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.
Joshua 3:38 And he said to the children of Israel: 'When your children ask their fathers tomorrow, saying, 'What do these stones mean?'
Joshua 3:39 'then you shall teach them and say: 'Israel crossed over this Jordan River on dry ground,'
Joshua 3:40 'because the Lord your God dried up its waters before you, until you had crossed over, just as He did previously in the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we crossed.'
Joshua 3:1 Joshua rose early in the morning and moved the camp from Abel. He, along with all the children of Israel, came to the Jordan River. There they stayed for three days.
Joshua 3:2 After the three days had passed, the officers went throughout the camp,
Joshua 3:3 and they gave orders to the people, saying: "When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, with the priests of the tribe of Levi carrying it, then you yourselves must also get up and follow them.
Joshua 3:4 But there must be a great distance between you and the ark; do not approach it. This distance should be about two thousand cubits, which is approximately half a mile. Then you will know which way to go, because you have never traveled this path before.
Joshua 3:5 Joshua also said to the people: "Sanctify yourselves, meaning, prepare yourselves spiritually and physically. For tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you."
Joshua 3:6 And he said to the priests: "Take up the ark of the covenant and go before the people." So they did as they were commanded; they took up the ark and went ahead of them.
Joshua 3:7 Then the Lord said to Joshua: "Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that just as I was with Moses, so I will also be with you.
Joshua 3:8 Command the priests who carry the ark of the covenant and tell them: 'When you have entered part of the water of the Jordan River, stand still in the Jordan itself.'"
Joshua 3:9 Joshua then said to the children of Israel: "Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God."
Joshua 3:10 And he continued: "By this, you will know that the living God is in your midst, and that He will certainly drive out before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and also the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
Joshua 3:11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go before you through the Jordan River.
Joshua 3:12 Now therefore, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.
Joshua 3:13 And when the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the Lord, the God of all the earth, touch the waters of the Jordan, the waters that flow downstream will be cut off and will run dry. But the waters coming down from upstream will stand still, forming a single heap in one place.
Joshua 3:14 So the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, and the priests who carried the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.
Joshua 3:15 And as soon as they entered the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who carried the ark were dipped in the edge of the water—for the Jordan usually overflows all its banks during the time of the wheat harvest—
Joshua 3:16 the waters coming down from upstream stood still in one heap, swelling up like a mountain far away, near the city of Adam, which is in the region of Zaretan. And the waters that were flowing downstream continued to flow into the Sea of the Desert (which is now called the Dead Sea) until they completely disappeared. Meanwhile, the people stood opposite Jericho, across the Jordan.
Joshua 3:17 But the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River. And all the people passed over on the dry riverbed until everyone had completely crossed the Jordan.
Joshua 4:1 After all the people of Israel had completely finished crossing the Jordan River, the Lord God spoke to Joshua, saying:
Joshua 4:2 'Choose twelve men from among the Israelite people—one man specifically from each of the twelve tribes.'
Joshua 4:3 'And command them, saying: "Take up twelve large stones from the very middle of the Jordan River's bed, from the precise spot where the priests' feet stood firm and dry. You are to carry these stones and set them down at the campsite where you will pitch your tents tonight."'
Joshua 4:4 So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared and appointed from among the sons of Israel—one man chosen from each of the tribes.
Joshua 4:5 And Joshua said to them, 'Go ahead of the Ark of the Lord your God, into the very middle of the Jordan River. Let each one of you then lift a large stone onto his shoulder, so there will be one stone for each of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.'
Joshua 4:6 'These stones are to serve as a perpetual sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, saying: "What do these stones mean?"'
Joshua 4:7 'You are to answer them by saying: "It is because the waters of the Jordan River were completely cut off and dried up before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, when it crossed over the Jordan! These stones were set up as a permanent memorial for the sons of Israel, to last for all time."
Joshua 4:8 So the sons of Israel did exactly as Joshua had commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River's bed, just as the Lord God Himself had commanded them, one stone for each of the tribes of Israel. They carried them to their campsite and set them up there.
Joshua 4:9 Furthermore, Joshua also set up another twelve stones in the very middle of the Jordan River, at the precise spot where the feet of the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant had stood dry. Those stones remain there even to this very day as a witness.
Joshua 4:10 Meanwhile, the priests who were carrying the Ark remained standing firmly in the middle of the Jordan River. They stood there until everything the Lord God had commanded Joshua to tell the people was fully accomplished, just as Moses had instructed Joshua concerning all these things. And the people quickly hurried across the dry riverbed.
Joshua 4:11 After all the Israelite people had completely crossed the river, the Ark of the Lord and the priests then moved from the riverbed and crossed over to the land, proceeding to lead the people forward.
Joshua 4:12 And the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh, marched ahead of the other sons of Israel, just as Moses had specifically commanded them to do earlier.
Joshua 4:13 About forty thousand armed men, organized into their various companies and divisions, fully equipped and ready for battle, crossed over to the plains outside Jericho.
Joshua 4:14 On that very day, the Lord God exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel. From that point on, the people honored him and held him in reverent awe, just as they had honored Moses, for all the days of Joshua's life.
Joshua 4:15 Then the Lord God spoke to Joshua, saying:
Joshua 4:16 'Command the priests who are carrying the Ark of the Covenant to come up out of the Jordan River bed.'
Joshua 4:17 So Joshua immediately commanded the priests, saying: 'Come up now, out of the Jordan River!'
Joshua 4:18 And as soon as the priests, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, came up out of the middle of the Jordan River's bed, and the soles of their feet were firmly planted on the dry ground of the bank, the waters of the Jordan immediately rushed back into their channel. And the river began to flow over all its banks again, just as it had been flowing before the miracle.
Joshua 4:19 The Israelite people crossed up out of the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month. They then set up their camp at Gilgal, which is located on the eastern side of the city of Jericho.
Joshua 4:20 And Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they had taken from the Jordan River's bed, at Gilgal, as a permanent monument.
Joshua 4:21 Joshua then spoke to the sons of Israel and said: 'In the future, when your children ask their fathers, saying: "What do these stones mean?"'
Joshua 4:22 'You are to teach them and explain: "The Israelite people crossed over this Jordan River on completely dry ground—a great miracle!"'
Joshua 4:23 '...just as the Lord your God did at the Red Sea, which He completely dried up before us until we had all finished crossing through it.'
Joshua 4:24 '...so that all the peoples of the earth may know and understand the incredibly powerful hand of the Lord God—and so that you, the Israelite people, may also revere and fear the Lord your God for all your days, always remembering His mighty acts.'
Joshua 4:1 After everyone had finished crossing over the Jordan River, the Lord God spoke to Joshua, saying:
Joshua 4:2 “Choose twelve men from the people, one man for each of the twelve tribes of Israel.
Joshua 4:3 Then command them to take twelve very hard stones from the middle of the Jordan River, from the exact spot where the priests’ feet stood still. You are to place these stones in the location where you will set up your tents tonight.”
Joshua 4:4 So Joshua called the twelve men he had selected from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe.
Joshua 4:5 And he told them, “Go before the Ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan River. Each of you must carry one stone on your shoulder, corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
Joshua 4:6 This is to be a sign among you, so that when your children ask you in the future, saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’
Joshua 4:7 You will answer them: ‘The waters of the Jordan were cut off and stopped flowing before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, when it crossed over the river. That is why these stones are set as a memorial for the sons of Israel forevermore.’”
Joshua 4:8 So the sons of Israel did exactly as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River, just as the Lord God had commanded Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and carried them to the place where they were going to set up their tents for the night. And there they set them down.
Joshua 4:9 Joshua also set up another twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan River, right where the feet of the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant had stood. These stones remain there even to this present day.
Joshua 4:10 The priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant stood firm in the middle of the Jordan, until everything the Lord God had commanded Joshua to tell the people was completed, just as Moses had instructed him. And the people quickly crossed over.
Joshua 4:11 After all the people had completely crossed over, the Ark of the Lord God and the priests crossed over as well, moving in front of the people.
Joshua 4:12 Also, the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh went ahead of the other sons of Israel, just as Moses had commanded them to do.
Joshua 4:13 About forty thousand armed men, arrayed in battle formations, crossed over before the Lord God for battle on the plains near the city of Jericho.
Joshua 4:14 On that very day, the Lord God made Joshua great in the sight of all Israel. So the people feared him, just as they had feared Moses throughout all the days of his life.
Joshua 4:15 Then the Lord God spoke to Joshua again, saying:
Joshua 4:16 “Command the priests who are carrying the Ark of the Covenant to come up out of the Jordan River.”
Joshua 4:17 So Joshua gave them the command, saying, “Come up out of the Jordan River.”
Joshua 4:18 As soon as the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord God came up from the middle of the Jordan River, and their feet touched the dry ground on the other bank, the waters of the Jordan returned to their usual course. The river flowed as it did before, covering all its banks.
Joshua 4:19 The people themselves came up from the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month. They camped at Gilgal, which is on the eastern side of the city of Jericho.
Joshua 4:20 Joshua also set up the twelve stones, which they had taken from the middle of the Jordan River, at Gilgal.
Joshua 4:21 And he said to the sons of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in the time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones mean to us?’
Joshua 4:22 You will instruct them and say: ‘Israel crossed over this Jordan River on dry ground through the riverbed.
Joshua 4:23 The Lord our God dried up its waters before us until we had completely crossed over.
Joshua 4:24 This was just like what He did once before at the Red Sea, which He also dried up before us until we had completely crossed over. This miracle happened so that all the peoples of the earth may learn that the hand of the Lord God is very mighty, and so that you yourselves may always revere the Lord your God.’”
Joshua 5:1 After all the kings of the Amorites, who lived on the western side of the Jordan River, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who lived by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan River before the children of Israel, until they had all crossed over, their hearts were dismayed and they were greatly afraid. There was no more courage left in them, because they feared the entry of the children of Israel into their land.
Joshua 5:2 At that time, the Lord said to Joshua: "Make flint knives for yourself, and circumcise the children of Israel a second time."
Joshua 5:3 So Joshua made very sharp flint knives from a rock, and he circumcised the children of Israel on the Hill of Foreskins.
Joshua 5:4 Now, this is the reason for the second circumcision: all the male people who had come out of Egypt, all the fighting men, had died in the wilderness along the very long journey.
Joshua 5:5 All these men had been circumcised in Egypt; but in the desert, after they had left Egypt, their children were born uncircumcised.
Joshua 5:6 For the children of Israel walked through the desert for forty years, until all the multitude of fighting men who had come out of Egypt were consumed—who had not obeyed the voice of the Lord. The Lord had sworn to them that He would not show them the land flowing with milk and honey, a most excellent and fertile land.
Joshua 5:7 Therefore, the sons of these men succeeded their fathers, and they themselves were circumcised by Joshua, because they were still in their foreskins just as they had been born, and no one had circumcised them on the journey.
Joshua 5:8 After everyone was circumcised, they remained in the same place in the camp until they recovered.
Joshua 5:9 Then the Lord said to Joshua: "Today, I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you." And the name of that place has been called Gilgal even to this present day.
Joshua 5:10 So the children of Israel remained in Gilgal and celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, on the plains of Jericho.
Joshua 5:11 And on the very next day, they ate from the produce of the land: unleavened bread and parched grain from that very year.
Joshua 5:12 And the manna ceased, after they had eaten from the produce of the land. The children of Israel no longer used it as food, but instead ate from the produce of that current year from the land of Canaan.
Joshua 5:13 While Joshua was in the field near Jericho, he lifted his eyes and saw a man standing opposite him, holding a drawn sword. Joshua, terrified, went to him and said: "Are you one of us, or one of our enemies?"
Joshua 5:14 He replied: "Neither. I am the commander of the army of the Lord, and now I have come." Joshua fell on his face to the earth, worshipped, and said: "What does my Lord say to His servant?"
Joshua 5:15 And the commander of the Lord's army said to Joshua: "Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground." And Joshua did as he had been commanded.
Joshua 6:1 Jericho was completely shut down and fortified because of the fear of the Israelites—the inhabitants had locked themselves inside, and no one could enter or leave.
Joshua 6:2 The Lord then spoke to Joshua, saying, "Listen, I have given Jericho into your power, along with its king and all of its mighty warriors."
Joshua 6:3 "All of you warriors, march around the city once each day, and you shall do this for six days."
Joshua 6:4 "And seven priests shall carry seven ram's horn trumpets—the kind used for the Jubilee celebration—and they shall walk before the Ark of the Covenant. But on the seventh day, you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow their trumpets loudly."
Joshua 6:5 "Then, when the ram's horn trumpet sounds a long and sustained blast, and it rings in your ears, all the people shall shout with a great roar, and the city walls will collapse completely, down to their very foundations. Then, each man shall enter the city straight ahead, wherever he stands."
Joshua 6:6 So Joshua called the priests and said to them, "Take up the Ark of the Covenant, and let seven other priests carry the Jubilee ram's horn trumpets before the Ark of the Lord."
Joshua 6:7 And to the people he said, "Go, and march around the city. Let the armed men lead the way before the Ark of the Lord."
Joshua 6:8 So, just as Joshua had commanded, while the people carried the Ark of the Lord, seven priests, holding seven ram's horn trumpets, went forward before the Ark of the Lord and blew their trumpets.
Joshua 6:9 The armed men went first, before the priests who carried the trumpets. The rest of the multitude followed the procession, and the trumpets continued to sound.
Joshua 6:10 Joshua had commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout, and your voice shall not be heard, nor shall any word come out of your mouth, until the day I tell you: 'Shout!' Then you shall shout loudly."
Joshua 6:11 So the Ark of the Lord marched around the city once each day, and then returned to the camp and remained there overnight.
Joshua 6:12 Joshua also rose early in the morning, and brought out the priests and the Ark of the Lord. The seven priests carried the seven ram's horn trumpets before the Ark of the Lord.
Joshua 6:13 And the armed men went ahead, and the rest of the multitude followed the procession, and the trumpets sounded continually.
Joshua 6:14 On the second day, they marched around the city once, and then returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
Joshua 6:15 And when they rose early on the seventh day, just as dawn was breaking, they marched around the city seven times, as it had been commanded.
Joshua 6:16 And when the priests blew their trumpets loudly on the seventh circuit, Joshua said to all of Israel, "Shout! For the Lord has given you the city."
Joshua 6:17 "This city, and everything in it, shall be completely consecrated to the Lord for destruction—except for Rahab the prostitute, who shall live, along with everyone who is in her house. This is because she hid the messengers whom we sent."
Joshua 6:18 "But as for you, be careful not to take anything from what is consecrated for destruction. If you do, you will become transgressors, bringing sin and trouble upon the entire camp of Israel."
Joshua 6:19 "For all the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated to the Lord and shall be placed in the Lord's treasury."
Joshua 6:20 So, when all the people shouted and the trumpets sounded, and as soon as the multitude heard the sound of the shout and the trumpets, the walls immediately collapsed. Then, each man went straight up into the city from where he stood, and they captured the city.
Joshua 6:21 And they utterly destroyed everything in the city with the edge of the sword, from man to woman, from infant to elder. They also struck down all the cattle, sheep, and donkeys.
Joshua 6:22 But Joshua said to the two men who had been spies, "Go into the house of that prostitute woman, and bring her out, along with everything that belongs to her, just as you swore to her."
Joshua 6:23 So the young men went in and brought out Rahab, her parents, her relatives, and all those of her family. They placed them outside the camp of Israel.
Joshua 6:24 They then burned the city and everything in it with fire, except for the silver, gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, which they consecrated into the treasury of the house of the Lord.
Joshua 6:25 But Joshua allowed Rahab the prostitute, and her father's household, and all that she possessed, to live. She has remained among Israel to this very day, because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to scout out Jericho. At that time, Joshua swore an oath, saying:
Joshua 6:26 "Cursed be the man before the Lord who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho. He shall lay its foundation at the cost of his firstborn son, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son."
Joshua 6:27 So the Lord was with Joshua, and his renown spread throughout all the land.
Joshua 6:1 Now, the city of Jericho had been completely closed off and heavily fortified. This was due to the fear of the Sons of Israel. As a result, no one could enter or exit the city gates.
Joshua 6:2 But the Lord said to Joshua: "Listen closely! I have already given Jericho into your power, along with its king and all of its strongest warriors."
Joshua 6:3 "All of you warriors must march around the city once each day. You must do this for six days."
Joshua 6:4 "And seven priests must carry seven trumpets—the kind used for the Jubilee celebration. On the seventh day, you must march around the city seven times, and the priests must blow their trumpets loudly."
Joshua 6:5 "When the trumpet sounds a long and more urgent blast, and it rings in your ears, then every one of you must shout together with a very loud cry. At that very moment, the city walls will utterly collapse, and each man can then enter the city directly from where he stands."
Joshua 6:6 So Joshua summoned the priests and said to them: "Lift up the Ark of the Covenant. And let seven other priests carry seven Jubilee trumpets ahead of the Lord's Ark."
Joshua 6:7 He also said to the people: "Go now, and march around the city. Let the armed men go ahead of the Lord's Ark."
Joshua 6:8 Therefore, just as Joshua had commanded, the seven priests with the seven trumpets—the type used for the Jubilee celebration—marched forward before the Lord, blowing their trumpets. And the Ark of the Lord's Covenant followed behind them.
Joshua 6:9 The armed men marched ahead of the main army, and the rest of the people followed the Ark. All of them marched together to the sound of the trumpets.
Joshua 6:10 But Joshua had given a specific command to the people, saying: "Do not shout, and do not let anyone hear your voice until I tell you, 'Shout!' Only then are you to raise your voices loudly."
Joshua 6:11 So the Ark of the Lord marched around the city once that day. Then it returned to the camp and remained there for the night.
Joshua 6:12 So Joshua rose early in the morning. He commanded the priests to carry the Ark of the Lord and the seven other priests to carry the seven Jubilee trumpets ahead of the Lord's Ark.
Joshua 6:13 The armed men also marched ahead, and the rest of the people followed the Ark, as the trumpets were continuously blown.
Joshua 6:14 And they marched around the city once on the second day, and then returned to the camp. They did this same thing for six days in total.
Joshua 6:15 But on the seventh day, they rose very early at dawn and marched around the city seven times, just as they had accustomed themselves to do. On that very day, they also ate bread (after the march).
Joshua 6:16 And when the priests blew their trumpets on the seventh circuit, Joshua said to all the people of Israel: "Now, shout! For the Lord has delivered the city into your hands!"
Joshua 6:17 "And this city, along with everything in it, must be utterly devoted to destruction for the Lord. Only Rahab, the prostitute, is to live, along with everyone who is with her in her house. This is because she hid the messengers whom we sent."
Joshua 6:18 "But you, beware that you do not take anything from what is devoted to destruction. If you do, you yourselves will become devoted to destruction, along with the entire camp of Israel, and you will bring trouble upon yourselves."
Joshua 6:19 "All silver and gold, and all vessels of bronze and iron, are to be consecrated to the Lord. They are to be placed in the Lord's treasury."
Joshua 6:20 Therefore, all the people shouted, and as the trumpets sounded, with everyone yelling together, the sound was heard from afar. Immediately, the city walls collapsed, and each man went up directly to the place opposite him, and they took the city.
Joshua 6:21 And they killed everyone who was in the city, from man to woman, from infant to elderly person. They also killed oxen, sheep, and donkeys with the edge of the sword.
Joshua 6:22 But Joshua said to the two men who had been the spies: "Go into the house of the prostitute woman, and bring her out, and all that belongs to her, just as you swore to her."
Joshua 6:23 So the young men went in and brought out Rahab, along with her parents, her brothers, all her relatives, and all their possessions. They then placed them outside the camp of Israel.
Joshua 6:24 But the city itself and everything in it they burned with fire, except for the silver, gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, which they consecrated into the treasury of the Lord's house.
Joshua 6:25 However, Joshua allowed Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all that she possessed to live. And she has remained in Israel even to this very day, because she had hidden the messengers whom he sent to spy out Jericho.
Joshua 6:26 At that time, Joshua made a solemn oath, saying: "Cursed before the Lord be the man who attempts to raise up and rebuild the city of Jericho! He will lay its foundation with his firstborn son, and he will set up its gates with his youngest child."
Joshua 6:27 So the Lord was with Joshua, and his renown was spread throughout all the land.
Joshua 7:1 However, the Israelites committed a serious transgression. They took some of the forbidden things—items that God had commanded to be utterly destroyed or set apart for Him. Achan, the son of Carmi, who was the son of Zabdi, from the clan of Zerah of the tribe of Judah, took some of these forbidden things. Because of this, the Lord became very angry with the Israelites.
Joshua 7:2 Joshua sent some men from Jericho to the city of Ai, which is located near Beth-aven, to the east of the city of Bethel. He commanded them, 'Go and scout out the land around Ai.' The men followed his orders and scouted Ai.
Joshua 7:3 When they returned, they reported to Joshua, 'There’s no need for our entire army to go. Only about two or three thousand men are needed to go up and conquer the city of Ai, because there are very few people there.'
Joshua 7:4 So about three thousand men from the Israelite army went up to Ai. But as soon as they faced the men of Ai, they turned and fled.
Joshua 7:5 Thirty-six of the Israelite men were killed. The men of Ai pursued them from the city gate all the way to Shebarim, striking them down on the slope as they fled. At this, the hearts of the Israelite people melted in fear and became like water, losing all courage.
Joshua 7:6 When Joshua heard what happened, he tore his clothes in grief and fell to the ground on his face before the Ark of the Lord. He remained there until evening, along with all the elders of Israel, and they threw dust on their heads as a sign of mourning and humiliation.
Joshua 7:7 Joshua cried out, 'Oh, Lord God! Why did You bring this people across the Jordan River, only to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites so they could destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan, in the wilderness!'
Joshua 7:8 'My Lord, what can I say now that Israel has turned its back and fled before its enemies?'
Joshua 7:9 'The Canaanites and all the other inhabitants of the land will hear about this defeat. They will surround us and wipe out our name from the face of the earth. What then will You do for Your great Name and reputation?'
Joshua 7:10 The Lord said to Joshua, 'Stand up! Why are you lying prostrate on the ground?'
Joshua 7:11 'Israel has sinned! They have violated My covenant, the solemn agreement I made with them. They have taken some of the forbidden things, stolen them, lied about it, and hidden them among their own possessions.'
Joshua 7:12 'Because of this, the Israelites will not be able to stand against their enemies until the one who is defiled by this wickedness is removed from among you.'
Joshua 7:13 'Get up! Sanctify the people, and tell them, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow.' For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'There are forbidden things in your midst, Israel. You will not be able to stand against your enemies until the one contaminated by this crime is removed from you.''
Joshua 7:14 'In the morning, you must present yourselves by your tribes. The tribe that the Lord indicates by lot will come forward by its clans. The clan that the Lord indicates will come forward by its families. And the family that the Lord indicates will come forward, man by man.'
Joshua 7:15 'The person who is discovered to have committed this crime will be burned with fire, along with everything he owns. This is because he has violated the Lord's covenant and has brought wickedness upon Israel.'
Joshua 7:16 So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel forward by its tribes, and the tribe of Judah was indicated by the Lord.
Joshua 7:17 Then he brought the clans of Judah forward, and the clan of Zerah was indicated. He then brought the families of Zerah forward, man by man, and Zabdi was indicated.
Joshua 7:18 Finally, he brought Zabdi's family forward, man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was indicated.
Joshua 7:19 Joshua said to Achan, 'My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and confess. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.'
Joshua 7:20 Achan replied to Joshua, saying, 'It is true; I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I did.'
Joshua 7:21 'Among the plunder, I saw a beautiful Babylonian cloak, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels. I desired these things and so I took them. I have hidden them in the ground inside my tent, with the silver buried underneath.'
Joshua 7:22 Joshua immediately sent messengers, and they ran to Achan's tent. They found everything hidden in that very place, including the silver.
Joshua 7:23 They took them out of the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and laid them before the Lord.
Joshua 7:24 Then Joshua, along with all the Israelites, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen, donkeys, sheep, his tent, and all his other possessions. They brought all these to the Valley of Achor.
Joshua 7:25 There, Joshua said, 'Because you have brought trouble upon us, may the Lord bring trouble upon you this very day.' Then all the Israelites stoned him to death. They also burned everything that belonged to him with fire, including his family members and animals, after stoning them.
Joshua 7:26 They raised a large pile of stones over him, which remains to this day. Then the fierce anger of the Lord turned away from them. That is why the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor, meaning 'Valley of Trouble', to this very day.
Joshua 7:1 The people of Israel committed a grave sin regarding the items devoted to God under the ban—those things meant for complete destruction and not for human plunder. Indeed, Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of these devoted items for himself. Because of this act of disobedience, the Lord God’s anger burned against all the people of Israel.
Joshua 7:2 After this, Joshua sent men from Jericho to go to Ai, a city near Beth-Aven, located to the east of the city of Bethel. He commanded them: 'Go and scout out the land.' So, they went and thoroughly explored Ai.
Joshua 7:3 When they returned, they reported to Joshua: 'There is no need for all the people to go up. Only two or three thousand men should go and attack the city, because the enemies there are very few.'
Joshua 7:4 So, about three thousand men from the people went up to Ai. But immediately, they turned their backs and fled from their enemies,
Joshua 7:5 and thirty-six men from Israel were killed. The enemy pursued them from the gate of the city to Shebarim—a place where the ground slopes downwards—and struck them down on the descent. Because of this defeat, the heart of the people of Israel melted away in fear, like water.
Joshua 7:6 When Joshua heard of this, he tore his clothes in grief and threw himself prostrate on the ground before the Ark of the Lord God. He lay there until evening, joined by all the elders of Israel. They also threw dust upon their heads as a sign of mourning and humiliation.
Joshua 7:7 And Joshua cried out: 'Oh, my Lord God, why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan River? Was it only to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites so they could destroy us? If only we had remained in the wilderness on the other side of the Jordan!'
Joshua 7:8 'My Lord, what can I say now that I see Israel turning their backs and fleeing from their enemies?'
Joshua 7:9 'When the Amorites and all the inhabitants of the land of Canaan hear of this defeat, they will surround us and wipe out our name from the face of the earth. What then will You do for Your great name, Lord God?'
Joshua 7:10 Then the Lord God said to Joshua: 'Stand up! Why are you lying prostrate on the ground like this?'
Joshua 7:11 'Israel has sinned! They have violated My covenant, the one I commanded them to keep. They secretly stole from the devoted items—those things under the ban—and then they lied about it and tried to hide it. Yes, they took some of the things that were meant to be completely set apart for Me.'
Joshua 7:12 'Therefore, the people of Israel will not be able to stand before their enemies; instead, they will flee from them. This is because they themselves have become subject to the ban, by taking what was devoted. I will no longer be with you unless you remove the devoted thing from among you.'
Joshua 7:13 'Get up! Go and sanctify the people for tomorrow. Tell them: "Purify yourselves for tomorrow, because this is what the Lord God of Israel says: 'There is a devoted thing among you, O Israel! You will not be able to stand before your enemies until you remove from your midst the one who has been defiled by this wicked act.'"'
Joshua 7:14 'In the morning, you must come forward, each of your tribes. Then, the tribe that the Lord God designates by lot must come forward by its clans. The clan chosen by lot must come forward by its households, and the household chosen by lot must come forward man by man.'
Joshua 7:15 'The person who is discovered to be guilty of this wicked act shall be burned with fire, along with everything he owns. This is because he has violated the Lord God's covenant and has committed a horrific crime against Israel.'
Joshua 7:16 So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel forward by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was designated by lot.
Joshua 7:17 When he brought the clans of Judah forward, the clan of Zerah was designated by lot. And when he brought that clan forward by its households, the household of Zabdi was found.
Joshua 7:18 Then, when he commanded each man in Zabdi’s household to come forward individually, Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was found to be the guilty one.
Joshua 7:19 Joshua then said to Achan: 'My son, give glory to the Lord God of Israel and make a confession. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.'
Joshua 7:20 Achan responded to Joshua, saying: 'Indeed, I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and this is what I did: '
Joshua 7:21 'Among the spoils I saw a very beautiful scarlet cloak, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels. I coveted them, so I took them. I buried them in the ground inside my tent, with the silver hidden underneath.'
Joshua 7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, who ran to Achan’s tent. There, they found everything hidden in that very place, including the silver.
Joshua 7:23 They took the items from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the people of Israel, and laid them out before the Lord God.
Joshua 7:24 Then Joshua, along with all the people of Israel, took Achan, son of Zerah, and the silver, the scarlet cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and all his possessions. They led him and everything he owned to the Valley of Achor.
Joshua 7:25 There, Joshua said to Achan: 'Because you have troubled us by your sin, may the Lord God trouble you this very day.' Then all the people of Israel stoned him to death, and everything that belonged to him was burned with fire.
Joshua 7:26 And they piled a great heap of stones over him, which remains to this very day as a memorial. After this, the Lord God's intense anger turned away from the people of Israel. That place has been called the Valley of Achor—meaning 'Trouble'—even to the present day.
Joshua 8:1 The Lord then spoke to Joshua, saying, 'Do not be afraid, nor be terrified! Take all your warriors with you, and go up against the city of Ai. Indeed, I have delivered into your hands the king of this city, its people, the city itself, and all its surrounding territory.'
Joshua 8:2 You shall do to the city of Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king. However, this time you may take all the plunder and animals as spoil for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.
Joshua 8:3 So Joshua and all his warriors rose up to march against Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his most valiant men and sent them out during the night.
Joshua 8:4 And he gave them these orders: 'Make sure you hide yourselves in ambush behind the city. Do not move too far from the city itself. Instead, all of you must be ready.'
Joshua 8:5 'My main army, and I along with them, will advance against the city from the front. When the men of Ai come out against us, just as they did before, we will pretend to flee and turn our backs, until we have lured them far away from their city.'
Joshua 8:6 'They will think that we are truly fleeing and will pursue us until we are far from the city. At that very moment, you are to rise up from your ambush and, without any hesitation, enter the city. The Lord your God will deliver it into your hands.'
Joshua 8:7 'And when you have captured it, set it on fire, so that the smoke from the ambush site will be a clear signal to us.'
Joshua 8:8 'And when you have captured the city, set it on fire. Whatever you do, make sure to do it exactly as I have commanded you—for I will be leading you.'
Joshua 8:9 Joshua then sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush, settling themselves between Bethel and Ai, on the western side of the city of Ai. Joshua himself spent that night in the valley with the main army.
Joshua 8:10 Joshua rose early in the morning, reviewed his army, and then, with the elders of Israel, he marched up against the city of Ai, with all the armed forces following him.
Joshua 8:11 When he had arrived and advanced opposite the city, he positioned his forces to the north of the city, with a valley lying between them and Ai.
Joshua 8:12 He had stationed the thirty thousand men in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the western side of that city.
Joshua 8:13 So the main army, which was to the north of the city, was behind Joshua and his battle lines, positioned so that the rear guard of the army touched the western side of Ai, with the valley still between them.
Joshua 8:14 When the citizens of Ai saw this, they swiftly gave orders, and at once, in the very early morning, they marched out of the city and advanced to battle against Israel, the king himself and all the people of the city proceeding to the flat plain. They did not know that the city had been surrounded by an ambush from behind.
Joshua 8:15 Joshua, with all the men of Israel, pretended to flee before them by way of the wilderness path.
Joshua 8:16 But the men of Ai, shouting and encouraging one another, pursued them. As the men of Ai were drawn away from their city, following the pursuers along the road,
Joshua 8:17 no one remained in either the city of Ai or Bethel who did not join the pursuit of Israel. With their cities left open and unguarded, they pursued Joshua.
Joshua 8:18 Then the Lord said to Joshua, 'Stretch out the shield—or javelin—that is in your hand towards the city of Ai, for I will deliver it to you.' When Joshua stretched out his shield—or javelin—towards the city,
Joshua 8:19 the men in ambush, who had been hiding on the western side of the city, immediately entered the city and captured it. Without anyone to stop them, they set the city on fire.
Joshua 8:20 And now the men of Ai, looking back, saw the smoke of their city ascending up towards the sky. They no longer had anywhere to flee, neither this way nor that. Especially when those who had pretended to flee into the wilderness now turned and advanced against them, along with those who had completely overturned the city.
Joshua 8:21 Joshua, and all the men of Israel, seeing that the city had been captured and that smoke was ascending from it, turned around and attacked the men of Ai.
Joshua 8:22 Indeed, those who had captured Ai also came out of the city to meet them, and the men of Ai found themselves trapped, with enemies on both sides, those from the front and those from the rear. So they were struck down, with none of them remaining or escaping.
Joshua 8:23 They also seized the king of the city of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua 8:24 So, when all the citizens of Ai who had fled to the plain and into the wilderness were killed, falling by a single sword—meaning a single decisive battle—all the men of Israel returned to Ai and struck down its inhabitants with the edge of the sword.
Joshua 8:25 The total number of those killed on that day, both men and women, was twelve thousand—all the people of the city of Ai.
Joshua 8:26 Joshua did not withdraw his hand, which he had stretched out holding the shield—or javelin—until all the inhabitants of Ai had been utterly destroyed.
Joshua 8:27 But the livestock and the plunder of the city, the sons of Israel divided among themselves, just as the Lord had commanded Joshua.
Joshua 8:28 The city of Ai, however, was burned to the ground and turned into a permanent desolation, remaining so to this very day.
Joshua 8:29 Its king he also hanged on a gallows until the evening sun. At sunset, Joshua gave the order, and they took his body down from the cross. They threw it into a pit that they had dug near the entrance of the city and raised a great pile of stones over it, which remains there to this very day.
Joshua 8:30 Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal.
Joshua 8:31 He built it just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of Israel, and as it is written in the book of the Law of Moses: an altar of unhewn stones, which no iron tool had touched. And upon it, he offered burnt offerings to the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings.
Joshua 8:32 And there, on those stones, he wrote a copy of the Law of Moses—a reiteration of the Law—which he had written in the presence of the children of Israel.
Joshua 8:33 All the people, including the elders, the leaders, and the judges, stood on both sides of the ark in the presence of the priests of the Levitical lineage who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. Both the sojourner and the native-born Israelite were there, with half of them standing near Mount Gerizim and the other half near Mount Ebal, just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded for the blessing of the people of Israel.
Joshua 8:34 After this, Joshua read all the words of blessing and cursing, and everything else that was written in the book of the Law.
Joshua 8:35 He left nothing unspoken that Moses had commanded, but read all of it in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, including the women, the children, and the sojourners who lived among them.
Joshua 8:1 The Lord then spoke to Joshua, saying, "Do not be afraid, and do not be terrified. Take with you all your fighting men, and go up against the city of Ai. Behold, I have delivered into your hand the king of this city, along with its people, the city itself, and its land."
Joshua 8:2 You will do to the city of Ai and its king exactly as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may keep the plunder and livestock for yourselves. Now, set an ambush behind the city.
Joshua 8:3 So Joshua rose up, and all the army of fighting men with him, to go up to Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his most courageous warriors and sent them out by night.
Joshua 8:4 He commanded them, saying, "See that you lie in ambush behind the city; do not go too far away from it."
Joshua 8:5 "I and the rest of the army that is with me will approach the city from the front. When they come out against us, just as they did before, we will flee and turn our backs."
Joshua 8:6 "We will keep fleeing until we have drawn them far away from the city. They will think that we are fleeing, just as we did the first time. And when we have fled,"
Joshua 8:7 "you will rise up from your ambush and enter the city without any doubt or hesitation, for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hands."
Joshua 8:8 "And when you have captured it, burn the city with fire. Do exactly as I have commanded you. See to it that you do not turn aside to the right or to the left."
Joshua 8:9 So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush, positioning themselves between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city of Ai. Joshua himself remained that night in the midst of the people.
Joshua 8:10 Joshua rose early in the morning and reviewed the army. Then he ascended with the elders at the head of the troops.
Joshua 8:11 When all the fighting men who were with him had come and gone up, they hurried and came opposite the city, taking up position on the north side of the city. There was a valley between them and Ai.
Joshua 8:12 And Joshua had also placed five thousand men in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the western side of that same city.
Joshua 8:13 Now, all the main army that had come to the north of the city, and the remaining men who had been designated for the ambush, marched on and set up their camp to the west of that same city. Joshua, during that night, passed through the middle of the valley, moving undetected.
Joshua 8:14 When the king of Ai saw this, he hurried out early in the morning and went forth with all the army of the city against Israel to battle, at a predetermined time, in the plain. He was entirely unaware that an ambush lay hidden behind the city.
Joshua 8:15 But Joshua and all Israel, feigning flight, turned their backs and headed along the way towards the wilderness.
Joshua 8:16 And the men of Ai, shouting loudly, urged one another to pursue them. In this manner, they drew out all those who were in the city, pursuing the fleeing Israelites.
Joshua 8:17 Not a single man remained in the cities of Ai or Bethel who did not pursue Israel. Leaving their cities open and defenseless, they followed after Joshua.
Joshua 8:18 The Lord then said to Joshua, "Extend the shield or javelin that is in your hand towards the city of Ai, because I will deliver it to you."
Joshua 8:19 And as soon as Joshua extended his hand, those who were lying in ambush immediately rose from their place. They ran and entered the city, captured it, and set it on fire.
Joshua 8:20 The men of the city who were pursuing Joshua looked back and saw the smoke of their city rising towards the sky. They could no longer escape in any direction, especially since those who had feigned flight towards the wilderness now turned and vigorously resisted their pursuers.
Joshua 8:21 So when Joshua and all Israel saw that the city had been captured and that smoke was rising from it, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.
Joshua 8:22 And those who had occupied Ai also came out from the city to meet their own men. Thus, the enemies were trapped and slaughtered in the middle, fighting from both sides, so that not a single one of them was left alive.
Joshua 8:23 They also seized the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
Joshua 8:24 So all Israel killed the inhabitants of Ai who had been in the fields and in the wilderness to which they had fled. All of them fell by the edge of the sword, until not a single one remained. Then the Israelites returned and struck down the city itself.
Joshua 8:25 And the total number of all those who fell on that day, both men and women, including the inhabitants of the city of Ai itself, was twelve thousand people.
Joshua 8:26 Joshua did not withdraw his hand, which he had extended while holding the shield or javelin, until all the inhabitants of Ai had been utterly destroyed.
Joshua 8:27 But the rest of the plunder and the livestock of that city Israel divided among themselves, just as the Lord had commanded Joshua.
Joshua 8:28 Joshua then burned the city of Ai, reducing it to a permanent mound of ruins, a desolate place even to this present day.
Joshua 8:29 Its king, he also hung on a gallows until the setting of the sun. When the sun went down, Joshua commanded them, and they took his corpse down from the gallows. It was then thrown at the very entrance of that city's gate, and they piled a great heap of stones over it, which remains there even to this present day.
Joshua 8:30 At that time, Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal.
Joshua 8:31 He built it exactly as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of Israel, and as it is written in the book of the Law of Moses: an altar of unhewn stones, which no iron tool had touched. And upon it, he offered burnt offerings to the Lord and sacrificed peace offerings.
Joshua 8:32 And upon these stones, Joshua wrote a copy of the Law of Moses, the Second Law, which Moses had written in the presence of the children of Israel.
Joshua 8:33 And all the people, including the elders, the leaders, and the judges, stood on both sides of the Ark in the sight of the priests of the Levitical lineage, who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. Both the foreigners and the native-born Israelites stood, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded them to bless the people of Israel.
Joshua 8:34 After this, Joshua read all the words of the blessing and the curse, and everything else that was written in the book of the Law.
Joshua 8:35 He did not omit anything that Moses had commanded, but recounted everything before the entire congregation of Israel, including the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who lived among the army.
Joshua 9:1 Now, when all these kings heard the news—the kings from across the Jordan, in the mountains and in the plains, on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and along the entire shore of the Great Sea—these also, who lived in the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,
Joshua 9:2 they gathered together to fight against Joshua and the people of Israel. They did this with a single purpose and common agreement.
Joshua 9:3 However, the people who lived in Gibeon, when they heard all that Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai—the complete destruction of those cities—
Joshua 9:4 they too began to plot deceitfully. They took old, moldy provisions and loaded them into worn-out sacks onto their donkeys. They also had wine skins that were old, torn, and badly patched up.
Joshua 9:5 They put on very old, worn-out sandals and dressed themselves in extremely old clothing. Even the bread they brought for their journey was dry, crumbly, and reduced to dust.
Joshua 9:6 Then they went to Joshua, at the camp in Gilgal, and said to him and to the leaders of Israel: 'We have come from a very distant land, because we want to make a treaty with you.'
Joshua 9:7 The men of Israel replied to the Gibeonites: 'Perhaps you live in our land. If that were the case, we are forbidden to make a treaty with you.'
Joshua 9:8 But they said to Joshua, 'We are your servants.' Joshua then asked them, 'Who are you, and where have you come from?'
Joshua 9:9 They replied: 'Your servants have come from a very distant land because of the fame of the name of the Lord your God. For we have heard about His great power, and all that He did in Egypt—'
Joshua 9:10 —and everything He did to the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan: namely, Sihon, king of Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth.
Joshua 9:11 'Therefore, the elders and all the inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying: "Take provisions for your journey, go to meet them, and say: 'We are your servants; make a treaty with us.'"'
Joshua 9:12 'Look at our bread: it was warm and fresh when we left our homes on the day we set out to come to you. But now, as you can see, it is dry and crumbled into dust.'
Joshua 9:13 'These wineskins also were new when we filled them, but now they are torn and split. And these clothes and sandals, which we are wearing and on our feet, are almost completely worn out because of the exceedingly long journey.'
Joshua 9:14 So the men of Israel accepted their provisions and were convinced by their story. However, they did not consult the Lord for guidance.
Joshua 9:15 Joshua then made peace with them, entering into a treaty and promising that they would be allowed to live. The leaders of the community also swore an oath to them.
Joshua 9:16 However, three days after the treaty was made, the Israelites heard that the Gibeonites were actually living nearby, and that they were inhabitants of their very own land.
Joshua 9:17 So the sons of Israel moved their camp and, on the third day, arrived at the Gibeonites' cities. These were the names of their cities: Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua 9:18 The sons of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel, making it a sacred and binding promise. Therefore, the entire community grumbled and complained against their leaders.
Joshua 9:19 The leaders replied to them: 'We have sworn an oath to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and therefore we cannot touch them to harm them.'
Joshua 9:20 'But this is what we will do to them: we will let them live and preserve their lives, lest the Lord become angry with us and punish us for breaking the oath we swore.'
Joshua 9:21 The leaders then said: 'They will live, but they will be assigned to cut wood and draw water for the service of the entire community.' And what the leaders said, so it was done.
Joshua 9:22 Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said to them: 'Why did you want to deceive us by saying, "We live far from you," when you actually live right in our midst?'
Joshua 9:23 'Therefore, you will be under a curse, and your descendants will never cease to be woodcutters and water-drawers for the house of my God, the sanctuary of the Lord.'
Joshua 9:24 They replied to Joshua, and said: 'It was clearly revealed to your servants that the Lord your God intended to hand over the entire land and all its inhabitants to you, wherever you went. Therefore, we were greatly afraid, and acting to save our lives, we did this.'
Joshua 9:25 'Now behold, we are in your hand. Do to us whatever seems good and right in your eyes.'
Joshua 9:26 So Joshua did as he had declared, and he delivered them from the hand of the sons of Israel, so that they were not killed.
Joshua 9:27 On that very day, Joshua appointed them to be woodcutters and water-drawers for the needs of the entire community and for the altar of the Lord, a service that continues even to this present day, in the place that the Lord would choose for His dwelling.
Joshua 9:1 But when all the kings across the Jordan River heard of these things—those who lived in the hill country, in the plains, and along the coastal parts of Greater Syria and Phoenicia, that is, those near the Great Sea—the Mediterranean Sea—and those beyond the Euphrates River, including the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—
Joshua 9:2 they all gathered together, united in mind and purpose, to fight against Joshua and the people of Israel.
Joshua 9:3 However, the people who lived in Gibeon, having heard everything that Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
Joshua 9:4 they too resorted to trickery. They took old, worn-out provisions, torn and mended sacks for their donkeys, and very old, patched-up sandals on their feet.
Joshua 9:5 They were also dressed in old garments, and the bread they carried for their journey was hard and crumbled into dust.
Joshua 9:6 They came to Joshua, who was then staying in Gilgal, and said to him, and to all the Israelites assembled, "We have come from a distant land. We earnestly ask you to make a covenant with us."
Joshua 9:7 The men of Israel answered the Gibeonites and said, "Perhaps you live in our land, and in that case, we cannot make a covenant with you."
Joshua 9:8 But they said to Joshua, "We are your servants." Joshua asked them, "Who are you, then, and where have you come from?"
Joshua 9:9 They answered: "Your servants have come from a very distant land because of the fame of the Lord your God. For we have heard of His mighty power, all that He did in Egypt,"
Joshua 9:10 "and to the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan River: Sihon, king of Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth."
Joshua 9:11 "Therefore, our elders and all the inhabitants of our land told us, saying: 'Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say: "We are your servants; make a covenant with us."'"
Joshua 9:12 "See, this bread, which we took warm from our homes when we set out to come to you, is now dry and crumbled into dust."
Joshua 9:13 "These wineskins, which we filled, were new, but now they are torn and mended. These garments and sandals which we are wearing on our feet are worn out from the very long journey."
Joshua 9:14 So the men of Israel accepted their provisions but did not consult the word of the Lord.
Joshua 9:15 Joshua then made peace with them and struck a covenant to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly swore an oath to it.
Joshua 9:16 However, three days after the covenant was made, they heard that the Gibeonites were actually nearby and lived right in the midst of their region.
Joshua 9:17 So the children of Israel broke camp and came to their cities on the third day. These were their names: Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua 9:18 But the children of Israel did not strike them down, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Therefore, the entire army grumbled against the leaders.
Joshua 9:19 The leaders answered them, saying, "We have sworn an oath to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and therefore we cannot touch them."
Joshua 9:20 "But we will do this for them: let them live, but they will eternally serve the entire assembly by cutting wood and carrying water."
Joshua 9:21 So the leaders spoke concerning the Gibeonites, that they should live, and as the leaders had said, they should cut wood and carry water for the entire assembly.
Joshua 9:22 Then Joshua called them and spoke to them, saying, "Why did you want to deceive us, by saying, 'We live very far away from you,' when in fact you are right in our midst?"
Joshua 9:23 "Therefore, you will be cursed, and there will never cease from your descendants those who cut wood and carry water for the house of my God."
Joshua 9:24 They answered Joshua and said, "We were very afraid that you would take our lives from us, because of this we did this thing. For we heard that the Lord your God had commanded His servant Moses to destroy all the inhabitants of the land with you."
Joshua 9:25 "Now therefore, we are in your hand. Whatever seems right and good to you, do to us."
Joshua 9:26 So Joshua did to them as he had spoken, and he delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel, so that they were not killed.
Joshua 9:27 Nevertheless, on that day, he appointed them to be woodcutters and water carriers for the use of all the people and for the altar of the Lord, right up to the present day, in the place which God would choose.
Joshua 10:1 When Adonisedec, the king of Jerusalem, heard the news that Joshua had taken Ai and utterly destroyed it—repeating the same total destruction he had brought upon Jericho and its king for Ai and its king—he also heard that the Gibeonites had willingly surrendered to Israel and entered into a peace treaty with them.
Joshua 10:2 They feared greatly, for Gibeon was a large city, one counted among the royal cities, and it was even greater than the town of Ai. All of its men were very strong warriors.
Joshua 10:3 So Adonisedec, the king of Jerusalem, sent messengers to Hoham, the king of Hebron; to Piram, the king of Jarmuth; to Japhia, the king of Lachish; and to Debir, the king of Eglon, saying this:
Joshua 10:4 “Come to me and provide military aid, so that we may attack Gibeon, because they have willingly surrendered to Joshua and the sons of Israel.”
Joshua 10:5 So these five kings of the Amorites gathered together—the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon—and they marched with their armies. They set up camp around Gibeon and began to besiege it.
Joshua 10:6 The inhabitants of Gibeon then sent a message to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not withdraw your help from your servants! Come up quickly and deliver us; bring us military aid, for all the kings of the Amorites who live in the hill country have gathered against us.”
Joshua 10:7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, and the entire army of very strong men went with him, along with all his robust warriors.
Joshua 10:8 The Lord then spoke to Joshua, saying, “Do not fear them. For I have delivered them into your hands; none of them will be able to resist you in battle.”
Joshua 10:9 Joshua marched up from Gilgal throughout the entire night, and he unexpectedly attacked them at dawn.
Joshua 10:10 The Lord threw them into confusion before Israel, and Joshua struck them with a great slaughter at Gibeon. He then pursued them along the road that ascends to Beth-Horon, and continued the chase as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
Joshua 10:11 As they fled from the sons of Israel and were on the descent from Beth-Horon, the Lord sent large hailstones down on them from the sky all the way to Azekah. Many more of them died from these hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel struck down with the sword.
Joshua 10:12 Then Joshua spoke to the Lord on the day when God delivered the Amorites into the hand of Israel. He said publicly, in the sight of all Israel, “Sun, do not move from your position over Gibeon! And Moon, do not move from your position over the Valley of Ajalon!”
Joshua 10:13 The sun stood still, and the moon remained in its place, until the nation of Israel had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? The sun stood in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to set for about an entire day.
Joshua 10:14 Neither before nor since has there been such a long day, for the Lord obeyed the voice of a man, and the Lord fought on behalf of Israel.
Joshua 10:15 Joshua then returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua 10:16 Meanwhile, the five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave near the city of Makkedah.
Joshua 10:17 It was reported to Joshua that the five kings had been found hiding in a cave near the city of Makkedah.
Joshua 10:18 Joshua gave orders, saying, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and place men over them to guard them.”
Joshua 10:19 He continued, “But you are not to stand still! Instead, pursue the enemies and strike down their rear guard. Do not allow any of them to re-enter the cities to which they were fleeing, for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hands.”
Joshua 10:20 Consequently, nearly all of the enemy were cut down, and only a very small number escaped, making it into fortified cities.
Joshua 10:21 Then the entire army returned to Joshua at Makkedah, safe and sound. No one dared to utter a word against the sons of Israel.
Joshua 10:22 Joshua then commanded, saying, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.”
Joshua 10:23 So they did as he commanded and brought the five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
Joshua 10:24 When the kings had been brought out, Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the army who were with him, “Come forward and place your feet upon the necks of these kings.” When they had come forward and placed their feet on their necks,
Joshua 10:25 Joshua said to them again, “Do not be afraid or discouraged. Be strong and courageous! For in this very way, the Lord will treat all your enemies against whom you fight.”
Joshua 10:26 Joshua then struck them down and killed them, hanging their bodies on four separate trees. They hung there until the evening.
Joshua 10:27 When the sun was setting, Joshua gave the order, and they took their bodies down from the stakes. They then threw them into the cave where they had hidden, and they placed enormous stones over its mouth, which remain there to this very day.
Joshua 10:28 On that very day, Joshua captured Makkedah. He struck the city with the edge of the sword, killing its king and all the people in it, leaving no survivors. He treated the king of Makkedah just as he had treated the king of Jericho.
Joshua 10:29 Joshua then marched with all Israel from Makkedah to Libnah, and he attacked it.
Joshua 10:30 The Lord also delivered Libnah and its king into the hand of Israel. Joshua struck the city with the edge of the sword, and every living soul who resided in it, leaving no survivors there. They treated the king of Libnah just as they had treated the king of Jericho.
Joshua 10:31 From Libnah, Joshua passed on to Lachish with all Israel. They encamped around it and attacked it.
Joshua 10:32 The Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, and they captured it on the second day. Joshua struck every living soul who had been in it with the edge of the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.
Joshua 10:33 At that very time, Hoham, the king of Gezer, came up to provide aid to Lachish. But Joshua struck him and all his people until not one survivor remained.
Joshua 10:34 Joshua then moved from Lachish to Eglon, passing through with all Israel. He besieged the city and fought against it.
Joshua 10:35 He captured it on the same day and struck all who were in it with the edge of the sword, killing every living soul, just as he had done to Lachish.
Joshua 10:36 Joshua also went up from Eglon to Hebron with all Israel and fought against it.
Joshua 10:37 He captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, along with its king, all its towns in that region, and every living soul who was in it. He left no survivors in it. Just as he had done to Eglon, so he did to Hebron, utterly destroying everything he found within it.
Joshua 10:38 Then Joshua returned to Debir, captured it, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He also killed its king, all the surrounding towns, and every living soul who was in it.
Joshua 10:39 He left no survivors in it. Just as he had done to Hebron and Libnah and their kings, so he did to Debir and its king.
Joshua 10:40 So Joshua struck down all the land of the hill country, the Negeb in the south, the lowland, and the slopes, along with all their kings. He left no survivors in any of it, but utterly destroyed everything that could breathe, just as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him.
Joshua 10:1 When Adonisedec, the king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured Ai and utterly destroyed it—he had done the same to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king—and that the Gibeonites had willingly surrendered to Israel and were now allied with them:
Joshua 10:2 he feared greatly, especially because the city of Gibeon was a great city, counted among the royal cities, larger than the town of Ai, and all its men were very strong warriors.
Joshua 10:3 So Adonisedec, the king of Jerusalem, sent messengers to Hoham, the king of Hebron, and to Piram, the king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, the king of Lachish, and to Debir, the king of Eglon, saying:
Joshua 10:4 “Come to me and bring your forces, so that we may attack Gibeon. For it has surrendered to Joshua and the children of Israel.”
Joshua 10:5 So, having been called together, the five kings of the Amorites went: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. They, along with all their armies, went up and encamped around Gibeon, attacking it.
Joshua 10:6 And the inhabitants of Gibeon sent a message to Joshua, who at that time was staying at Gilgal, and they said to him: “Do not withdraw your aid from your servants. Come up quickly and deliver us, and bring us help, because all the kings of the Amorites who live in the mountains have gathered against us.”
Joshua 10:7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, and the entire army of warriors with him, including all his strongest men.
Joshua 10:8 And the Lord said to Joshua: “Do not fear them. For I have delivered them into your hands, and none of them will be able to resist you.”
Joshua 10:9 So Joshua suddenly attacked them, having marched all night from Gilgal.
Joshua 10:10 And the Lord threw them into confusion before Israel, and crushed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon. And Israel pursued them by the way leading up to Beth-horon, striking them all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
Joshua 10:11 And as they were fleeing from Israel and were on the descent of Beth-horon, the Lord sent large hailstones down upon them from the sky all the way to Azekah. Many more died from the hailstones than those whom the children of Israel had killed with the sword.
Joshua 10:12 Then Joshua spoke to the Lord on the day when the Lord delivered the Amorites into the sight of the children of Israel. He said in the sight of all the people: “Sun, stand still over Gibeon, and Moon, stand still over the Valley of Aijalon.”
Joshua 10:13 And the sun stood still and the moon stopped, until the nation had taken vengeance on its enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? So the sun stood still in the middle of the sky, and it did not hasten to set for a whole day.
Joshua 10:14 There has not been a day so long, before or since, when the Lord obeyed the voice of a man and fought for Israel.
Joshua 10:15 Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, returned to the camp at Gilgal.
Joshua 10:16 For the five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave near the city of Makkedah.
Joshua 10:17 And it was reported to Joshua that the five kings had been found hiding in a cave near the city of Makkedah.
Joshua 10:18 He commanded and said: “Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave, and station men over them to guard them carefully.”
Joshua 10:19 “But you, do not stand still. Instead, pursue your enemies and strike down all the stragglers of their fleeing army. Do not allow them to enter the protection of their cities, for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hands.”
Joshua 10:20 So, after such a great slaughter of their enemies, and almost completely destroying them—meaning those who had been able to escape and enter fortified cities—
Joshua 10:21 the entire army returned to Joshua at Makkedah, safe and sound. No one dared to utter a word against the children of Israel.
Joshua 10:22 And Joshua said: “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out the five kings from the cave to me.”
Joshua 10:23 And they did so. They brought out the five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
Joshua 10:24 And when they were brought out, Joshua called all the men of Israel, and he said to the commanders of the army and the leaders of the warriors who were with him: “Come forward and place your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and stepped on their necks.
Joshua 10:25 Again he said to them: “Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and be firm, for the Lord will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight.”
Joshua 10:26 And Joshua struck them and killed them, and he hanged them on five trees. They remained hanging until evening.
Joshua 10:27 And when the sun was setting, Joshua commanded them to take them down from the gallows. So they took them down and threw them into the cave where they had hidden, and they placed large stones over its mouth, which remain there to this very day.
Joshua 10:28 On that same day, Joshua captured Makkedah and struck it down with the edge of the sword. He killed its king and all its inhabitants, leaving no survivors in it. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua 10:29 Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Makkedah to Libnah, and he fought against it.
Joshua 10:30 The Lord delivered it, along with its king, into the hands of Israel. Joshua struck the city with the edge of the sword, and all its inhabitants. He left no survivors in it, and he did to the king of Libnah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
Joshua 10:31 From there, Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Libnah to Lachish. Having arranged his army all around it, he attacked it.
Joshua 10:32 And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel. Joshua captured it on the second day and struck it down with the edge of the sword, killing everyone in it, just as he had done to Libnah.
Joshua 10:33 At that time, Horam, the king of Gezer, came up to bring aid to Lachish. Joshua struck him and all his people until not one was left alive.
Joshua 10:34 Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Lachish to Eglon. They surrounded it and attacked it.
Joshua 10:35 He captured it on that same day and struck down with the edge of the sword everyone who was in it, in the same manner as the slaughter he had carried out in Libnah.
Joshua 10:36 Joshua also went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron, and he fought against it.
Joshua 10:37 He captured it and struck it down with the edge of the sword. He also struck down its king and all the cities of that region, and all its inhabitants. He left no survivors in it. Just as he had done to Eglon, so he did to Hebron and to all its surrounding towns.
Joshua 10:38 Returning from there, Joshua, and all Israel with him, went to Debir and fought against it.
Joshua 10:39 He captured it and utterly destroyed it, killing every living soul that was in it. He left no survivors there. Just as he had done to Hebron and Libnah, so he did to Debir and its king.
Joshua 10:40 So Joshua struck down all the mountainous land, and the southern region, and the lowlands, and the slopes of the mountains, along with all their kings. He left no survivors in it, but killed everything that breathed, just as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him.
Joshua 11:1 When Jabin, the king of Hazor, heard what had happened, he sent messengers to Jobab, the king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph.
Joshua 11:2 He also sent to the kings in the northern mountainous regions, and in the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the lowlands, and in the region of Dor, which is by the sea.
Joshua 11:3 He also sent to the Canaanites in the east and west, and to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites who lived in the mountainous areas, and to the Hivites who lived below Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
Joshua 11:4 So all these kings went out with their armies; a great many people, as numerous as the sand on the seashore, with an endless multitude of horses and chariots.
Joshua 11:5 They gathered together and came as one, and they camped by the waters of Merom to fight against the people of Israel.
Joshua 11:6 And the Lord said to Joshua: "Do not be afraid of them, because tomorrow at this very hour, I will hand all these people over, defeated, into the presence of Israel. You will hamstring their horses, rendering them useless, and burn their chariots with fire."
Joshua 11:7 So Joshua and all his army came upon them suddenly at the waters of Merom and attacked them.
Joshua 11:8 The Lord handed them over into the power of Israel, who struck them down and pursued all of them as far as Great Sidon, and to Misrephoth-Maim, and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east. They drove them away and struck them down until there was no one left alive.
Joshua 11:9 And Joshua did exactly as the Lord had commanded: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
Joshua 11:10 At that time, Joshua returned and captured Hazor and killed its king with the sword, because Hazor had historically held the chief authority among all these kingdoms.
Joshua 11:11 And he struck down every living soul who resided there, utterly destroying them. He left no survivors in Hazor, but utterly devastated everything until it was desolate.
Joshua 11:12 Joshua also captured all the other cities of these kings and their kings themselves, striking them down with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them, just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded him.
Joshua 11:13 However, Joshua did not burn down any of the cities located on hills or mounds, except for Hazor alone, which he had burned down because it was a very heavily fortified city.
Joshua 11:14 But all the plunder from these cities and the livestock, the sons of Israel divided among themselves. They did not leave any person alive from all those they were able to capture.
Joshua 11:15 Just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded Joshua, so Joshua completely fulfilled everything. He did not omit a single word from all the commands that the Lord had given to Moses.
Joshua 11:16 So Joshua took control of all the mountain country, and all the Negeb region in the south, and all the land of Goshen, and the plain, and the western region, and the mountainous country of Israel, and its lowlands.
Joshua 11:17 He took the land from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, all the way to Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon, below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, struck them down, and killed them.
Joshua 11:18 Joshua fought against these kings for a long time.
Joshua 11:19 There was not a single city that surrendered to the sons of Israel, except for the Hivites who lived in Gibeon. Joshua captured all the rest through warfare.
Joshua 11:20 For it was the Lord's will to harden their hearts so that they would fight against Israel and fall, and not deserve any mercy, and perish, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Joshua 11:21 At that time, Joshua came and wiped out the Anakim from the mountainous regions of Hebron, Debir, and Anab, and from all the mountain country of Judah and Israel. He utterly destroyed their cities.
Joshua 11:22 There were no Anakim left alive in the land of the sons of Israel, except in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod, where some survivors remained.
Joshua 11:23 So Joshua took possession of all the land, just as the Lord had promised to Moses. He gave it as an inheritance to the sons of Israel, according to their divisions and their tribes. And then the land had rest from the battles.
Joshua 11:1 After hearing all these things, King Jabin of Hazor sent messengers to King Jobab of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph;
Joshua 11:2 He also sent to the kings of the northern regions, who held the nearby territories: to the mountain dwellers and those who lived in the plains south of Chinnereth (which is the Sea of Galilee), and to the Samarites and the Nafeth Dor who lived along the coastal region.
Joshua 11:3 He sent also to the Canaanites in the east and west, and to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the mountains; and to the Hivites who lived under Mount Hermon, in the land of Mizpah.
Joshua 11:4 So they all came out with their armies—a vast multitude of people, as numerous as the sand on the seashore; and their horses and chariots were beyond counting.
Joshua 11:5 And gathering together, they encamped by the waters of Merom, so that they could fight against Israel.
Joshua 11:6 Then the Lord said to Joshua: 'Do not be afraid of them, because at this time tomorrow, I will deliver all these people to be wounded before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.'
Joshua 11:7 So Joshua and all his army came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and they rushed upon them.
Joshua 11:8 And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them down and pursued them as far as Great Sidon, and to the waters of Misrephoth, and to the valley of Mizpah to the east. All of them fell, with no one left remaining.
Joshua 11:9 And Joshua did just as the Lord had commanded: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
Joshua 11:10 Then, immediately returning, he captured Hazor and put its king to death with the sword. For Hazor in ancient times was the capital city of all these kingdoms.
Joshua 11:11 And he struck down every living person who lived there with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; no soul remained alive, but all were consumed. And he burned Hazor itself with fire.
Joshua 11:12 Joshua captured all those cities and their kings, and struck them down with the edge of the sword, and completely destroyed them, just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded him.
Joshua 11:13 However, Israel did not fight to overthrow the cities that were situated on hills and mounds; only Hazor did Joshua burn down.
Joshua 11:14 And all the plunder of these cities, and the livestock, the sons of Israel divided among themselves. They killed all the people, leaving no one breathing.
Joshua 11:15 Just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded him, so Joshua carried out everything. He omitted nothing of what had been commanded to him.
Joshua 11:16 So Joshua took all the mountain land, and the southern land, and the land of Goshen, and the plain, and the western region; and the mountain of Israel, and its plains,
Joshua 11:17 from Mount Halak, which ascends to Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon, below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, struck them down, and put them to death.
Joshua 11:18 For a long time Joshua fought against these kings.
Joshua 11:19 There was not one city that surrendered to the sons of Israel, except for the Hivites who lived in Gibeon; for Joshua captured all of them by war.
Joshua 11:20 For it was the Lord's decision to harden their hearts, so that they would fight against Israel, and fall, and not deserve any mercy, but perish, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
Joshua 11:21 At that time Joshua came and utterly destroyed the Anakim from the mountains—from Hebron, and from Debir, and from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah and Israel. He also destroyed their cities.
Joshua 11:22 He left none of the Anakim stock in the land of the sons of Israel, except for a small remnant in Gaza, and in Ashdod, and in Gath.
Joshua 11:23 So Joshua took all the land, just as the Lord had spoken to Moses, and he gave it as a possession to the sons of Israel, according to their divisions and tribes. And the land rested from war.
Joshua 12:1 These are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel defeated. They took possession of their land on the other side of the Jordan River, to the east, stretching from the Arnon ravine all the way to Mount Hermon, encompassing the entire eastern plain.
Joshua 12:2 Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, ruled from Aroer, which is situated on the bank of the Arnon ravine, including the middle section of the ravine itself, and half of Gilead, extending all the way to the Jabbok ravine, which marks the boundary of the sons of Ammon.
Joshua 12:3 His territory also extended from the desert all the way to the Sea of Chinneroth—the Sea of Galilee—on its eastern side, and south to the Dead Sea, which is the Salt Sea, along the eastern route that leads to Beth Jeshimoth, and from the southern part below the slopes of Pisgah.
Joshua 12:4 The boundaries of Og, king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaim giants, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei, stretched from Mount Hermon and Salecah, and included all of Bashan, extending to the borders of Geshur and Maachath, as well as half of Gilead, which was the territory of Sihon, king of Heshbon.
Joshua 12:5 Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the sons of Israel defeated these kings. And Moses divided their land as a possession for the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and for half of the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 12:6 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel defeated on the western side of the Jordan River. Their territory stretched from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon, all the way to Mount Halak, whose slopes rise toward Seir. Joshua then gave this land as a possession to the tribes of Israel, each tribe receiving its portion.
Joshua 12:7 This land included the hill country, the plains, the western foothills, the desert, and the Negeb—the southern region. It was the land of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
Joshua 12:8 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is near Bethel, one;
Joshua 12:9 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
Joshua 12:10 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

Joshua 12:18 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
Joshua 12:19 the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
Joshua 12:20 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
Joshua 12:21 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
Joshua 12:22 the king of Dor, and of the region of Dor, one;
Joshua 12:23 the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; the king of Tirzah, one.
Joshua 12:24 All these kings total thirty-one.
Joshua 12:1 These are the kings of the land whom the people of Israel defeated and whose land they took possession of. This was the territory east of the Jordan River, stretching from the Arnon stream all the way to Mount Hermon, including all the eastern plains that lead into the desert.
Joshua 12:2 One of them was Sihon, king of the Amorites, who ruled from Heshbon. His dominion extended from Aroer, which lies on the bank of the Arnon stream, through the middle of that stream's valley, and half of Gilead, up to the Jabbok stream, which served as the boundary for the Ammonites.
Joshua 12:3 His territory also stretched from the desert to the Sea of Chinnereth in the east, and to the Sea of the Desert—which is the Salt Sea—on the eastern side, along the road that leads to Beth Jeshimoth. On the southern side, his border extended below the slopes of Pisgah.
Joshua 12:4 The territory of Og, king of Bashan, was also conquered. He was one of the last of the Rephaim giants who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei. He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, and all of Bashan, extending to the borders of Geshur and Maachath.
Joshua 12:5 His dominion also included half of Gilead, up to the border of Sihon, king of Heshbon. Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the people of Israel defeated these kings. Moses, the Lord's servant, then gave their land as a possession to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 12:6 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the people of Israel defeated west of the Jordan River. Their territory stretched from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon all the way to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave this land as a possession to the tribes of Israel, assigning each tribe its own portion.
Joshua 12:7 This distribution included lands in the mountainous regions, the western foothills, the plains, the southern desert, and the Arabah valley.
Joshua 12:8 The people who inhabited these lands included the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Joshua 12:9 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is near Bethel, one;
Joshua 12:10 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
Joshua 12:11 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

Joshua 12:17 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
Joshua 12:18 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
Joshua 12:19 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
Joshua 12:20 the king of Shimron-Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
Joshua 12:21 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
Joshua 12:22 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
Joshua 12:23 the king of Dor, and its region, one; the king of Goyim in Gilgal, one;
Joshua 12:24 the king of Tirzah, one. In total, these are thirty-one kings.
Joshua 13:1 Joshua had grown old and was very advanced in years. And the Lord said to him, "You are old, and very advanced in years, yet a vast territory remains which has not yet been divided among the tribes."
Joshua 13:2 This is the territory that remains to be conquered: all the regions of the Philistines, and all of Geshur.
Joshua 13:3 It extends from the Shihor River, which is near Egypt, all the way to the northern border of Ekron. This is the land of the Canaanites, which is ruled by five Philistine lords: the leaders of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. It also includes the Hivites in the south.
Joshua 13:4 And from the south, all the land of Canaan, from Mearah of the Sidonians as far as Aphek and the territory of the Amorites.
Joshua 13:5 And the land of Gebal, and all of Lebanon to the east, from Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon, all the way to the entrance of Hamath.
Joshua 13:6 All who live in the mountainous region from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, and all the Sidonians—I will indeed drive them out from before the Israelites. You are to distribute this land by lot to the Israelites, just as I commanded you, even though it is not yet fully conquered.
Joshua 13:7 Therefore, you are to divide this land as an inheritance for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 13:8 (It is with these tribes that) Reuben and Gad, and the other half-tribe of Manasseh, received their territory east of the Jordan River, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had already given to them.
Joshua 13:9 Their territory began from Aroer, which is on the bank of the Arnon Gorge, and from the city in the middle of that valley, encompassing all the plain of Medeba as far as Dibon.
Joshua 13:10 It included all the cities of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, extending all the way to the border of the Ammonites.
Joshua 13:11 It also included Gilead, the territory of Geshur and Maacah, all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan as far as Salecah.
Joshua 13:12 This was the entire kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. He was one of the last of the Rephaim giants. Moses had defeated them and completely destroyed them.
Joshua 13:13 However, the Israelites did not drive out the inhabitants of Geshur and Maacah. Instead, they have lived among Israel to this very day.
Joshua 13:14 But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give any territorial inheritance. Instead, the sacrifices and offerings made to the Lord, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, just as He had commanded them through Moses.
Joshua 13:15 So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Reuben, according to their clans.
Joshua 13:16 Their territory extended from Aroer, located on the bank of the Arnon Gorge, including the city in the middle of the valley and all the plain leading to Medeba.
Joshua 13:17 It included Heshbon and all its associated towns in the plains, along with Dibon, Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon.
Joshua 13:18 Also Jahaz, Kedemoth, and Mephaath.
Joshua 13:19 And Kiriathaim, Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill in the valley.
Joshua 13:20 Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth.
Joshua 13:21 This included all the cities of the plain, and the entire kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had reigned in Heshbon. Moses had defeated Sihon and also killed the Midianite princes: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, who were the leaders allied with Sihon and living in that land.
Joshua 13:22 The Israelites also killed Balaam, the son of Beor, the diviner, with the sword, along with all the others who were slain.
Joshua 13:23 The Jordan River formed the western border for the descendants of Reuben. This was the inheritance of the Reubenites according to their clans, including their cities and their villages.
Joshua 13:24 Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, according to their clans.
Joshua 13:25 Their territory included Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites, as far as Aroer, which is opposite Rabbah.
Joshua 13:26 It also extended from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir.
Joshua 13:27 And in the valley, their cities included Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, which comprised the remaining portion of the kingdom of Sihon, king of Heshbon. The Jordan River was its western border, extending to the furthest point of the Sea of Chinnereth, on the east side of the Jordan.
Joshua 13:28 This was the inheritance of the Gadites, according to their clans, including their cities and their villages.
Joshua 13:29 Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh, according to their clans.
Joshua 13:30 Their territory extended from Mahanaim, including all of Bashan, all the kingdoms of Og king of Bashan, and all the sixty towns of Jair that are in Bashan.
Joshua 13:31 It also included half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of Og's kingdom in Bashan. This was given to the children of Machir, son of Manasseh, specifically to the half of the Machirites according to their clans.
Joshua 13:32 These are the inheritances that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, on the east side of the Jordan, across from Jericho.
Joshua 13:33 But to the tribe of Levi, Moses gave no territorial inheritance. For the Lord, the God of Israel, Himself is their inheritance and their portion, just as He had promised them.
Joshua 13:1 Joshua had indeed grown very old and was advanced in age. The Lord then spoke to him, saying: “You have indeed become old and very advanced in age, and there remains a vast, extensive land that has not yet been divided among the tribes.”
Joshua 13:2 This is the remaining territory: specifically all of Galilee, the entire land of the Philistines, and Geshur,
Joshua 13:3 Starting from the Nile River, which irrigates Egypt, stretching all the way to the border of Ekron towards the north. This is the land of Canaan, which is controlled by the five lords of the Philistines—specifically the lords of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron—and also the Hivites, who were also within this territory.
Joshua 13:4 Also, from the south, all the rest of the land of Canaan, from Maarah of the Sidonians, stretching all the way to Aphekah and the territory of the Amorites.
Joshua 13:5 And the land of the Gethrites, and all of Lebanon, reaching up to the waters of Misrephoth, and all of Misrephoth, and up to the land of the Sidonians.
Joshua 13:6 All those who live in the mountains, from Lebanon up to the waters of Misrephoth, and all the Sidonians: I Myself will drive them out from before the people of Israel. Your task, Joshua, is only to distribute this land by lot to Israel, just as I have commanded you.
Joshua 13:7 Therefore, you must now divide this land into portions as an inheritance for the nine tribes of Israel, and for the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 13:8 The other half of Manasseh, along with the tribes of Reuben and Gad, had already taken possession of the territory that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them on the eastern side of the Jordan River.
Joshua 13:9 Their territory began from Aroer, which is located on the bank of the Arnon River, and included the city itself in the middle of the valley, and the entire plain of Medeba, stretching as far as Dibon.
Joshua 13:10 It included all the cities of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and extended up to the borders of the Ammonites.
Joshua 13:11 Their land also included Gilead, and the territories of Geshur and Maachah, and the entire Mount Hermon region, and all of Bashan, reaching to Salecah.
Joshua 13:12 It encompassed all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei—he was one of the last of the Rephaim giants. Moses had defeated them and utterly destroyed them.
Joshua 13:13 However, the people of Israel did not completely drive out the Geshurites and Maachathites, but instead, they lived among Israel, and their descendants remain to this very day.
Joshua 13:14 But to the tribe of Levi, Moses gave no territorial inheritance, no land portion. Instead, the offerings by fire and sacrifices made to the Lord God of Israel are their inheritance, as the Lord Himself spoke to Moses.
Joshua 13:15 So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the people of Reuben, according to their family clans.
Joshua 13:16 Their territory began from Aroer, which is situated on the bank of the Arnon River, and included the city in the middle of the valley, and all the plain that extends towards Medeba.
Joshua 13:17 It included Heshbon and all its cities that are in the plain: Dibon, and Bamoth-Baal, and the city of Beth-Baal-Meon,
Joshua 13:18 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
Joshua 13:19 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth-Shahar on the hill of the valley.
Joshua 13:20 It also included Beth-Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-Jesimoth,
Joshua 13:21 all the cities of the plain, and the entire kingdom of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, the ruler who reigned in Heshbon. Moses had defeated him along with the chieftains of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—these were the commanders of Sihon, who lived in that territory.
Joshua 13:22 The people of Israel also put Balaam, the son of Beor, the diviner, to death with the sword, along with the others who were slain.
Joshua 13:23 And the Jordan River formed the boundary of Reuben's territory. This is the inheritance of the people of Reuben, according to their family clans, including all their cities and villages.
Joshua 13:24 Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the people of Gad, according to their family clans.
Joshua 13:25 Their territory included Jazer and all the cities of Gilead, and half of the land of the Ammonites, up to Aroer, which is opposite Rabbah.
Joshua 13:26 It extended from Heshbon to Ramath-Mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the borders of Debir.
Joshua 13:27 And in the valley: Beth-Haram, Beth-Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, which comprised the remaining part of the kingdom of Sihon, the king of Heshbon. The Jordan River was its boundary, extending to the end of the Sea of Chinnereth (the Sea of Galilee), on the eastern side of the Jordan.
Joshua 13:28 This is the inheritance of the people of Gad, according to their family clans, including all their cities and villages.
Joshua 13:29 Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh, according to their family clans.
Joshua 13:30 Their territory began from Mahanaim, and included all of Bashan, and the entire kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, and all the sixty towns of Jair which are in Bashan.
Joshua 13:31 It also included half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. These were given to the people of Machir, the son of Manasseh, to the half of the people of Machir, according to their family clans.
Joshua 13:32 These are the portions that Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan River, opposite Jericho, on the eastern side.
Joshua 13:33 However, Moses gave no territorial inheritance to the tribe of Levi. For the Lord God of Israel Himself is their inheritance and their portion, just as He had spoken to Moses.
Joshua 14:1 This is the full record of the land that the sons of Israel possessed in the land of Canaan, the land which Moses had assigned to them, and which Eleazar the priest and Joshua, the son of Nun, then formally distributed among them.
Joshua 14:1 These are the inheritances that the descendants of Israel received in the land of Canaan. Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the leaders of the families from the tribes of Israel distributed these inheritances to them.
Joshua 14:2 They divided all these inheritances by lot, just as the Lord had commanded through Moses, for the nine and a half tribes.
Joshua 14:3 For two tribes and half a tribe had already received their inheritance beyond the Jordan River, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given to them. This was apart from the Levites, who had not received any portion of land.
Joshua 14:4 The descendants of Joseph, however, were divided into two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim. And the Levites received nothing in the land, except cities to dwell in, and the pasture lands surrounding those cities for their cattle and their other livestock.
Joshua 14:5 So the descendants of Israel did just as the Lord had commanded Moses, and they divided the land.
Joshua 14:6 Then the descendants of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, spoke to him: 'You know what the Lord spoke to Moses, the man of God, concerning me and you at Kadesh-barnea.'
Joshua 14:7 'I was forty years old when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out this land. And I brought him back a report that I believed was true.'
Joshua 14:8 'But my brothers who went up with me caused the people to lose heart. Yet I fully followed the Lord my God.'
Joshua 14:9 'And on that day, Moses swore an oath, saying: "The land upon which your foot has walked shall be an inheritance for you and your descendants forever, because you have fully followed the Lord my God."'
Joshua 14:10 'And now I am older, for the Lord has extended my life since the time He spoke this word to Moses, when Israel was walking in the wilderness. It has been forty-five years since the Lord spoke this promise to me, and now I am eighty-five years old.'
Joshua 14:11 'Even to this day, I am as strong as I was at that time when Moses sent me to observe the land. I still have the same strength and vigor, both for fighting battles and for traveling long distances.'
Joshua 14:12 'Therefore, give me this mountain land, which the Lord promised, in your hearing. In this place, as you have heard, are the Anakim, and great and fortified cities. Perhaps the Lord will be with me, and I will be able to drive them out.'
Joshua 14:13 So Joshua blessed him and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.
Joshua 14:14 And from that time, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, even to this present day, because he had fully followed the Lord, the God of Israel.
Joshua 14:15 The name of Hebron was formerly called Kiriath Arba. Adam, the greatest man among the Anakim, was laid to rest there. And the land was at peace from battles.
Joshua 15:1 The inheritance for the tribe of Judah was then allocated, according to their clans. This lot extended to the border of Edom, specifically to the wilderness of Zin, facing south and reaching the extreme southern part of the region.
Joshua 15:2 Their southern border began at the southernmost tip of the Salt Sea,
Joshua 15:3 And from its bay, which faces south, the boundary went up to the Ascent of Akrabbim. It then passed through Zin, went up from Kadesh-Barnea, reached Hezron, ascended to Addar, and circled around Karkaa.
Joshua 15:4 From there, it passed through Heshmon and reached the Brook of Egypt. The boundary ended at the Great Sea. This was to be your southern border.
Joshua 15:5 The eastern boundary was from the start of the Salt Sea up to the Jordan River. For the northern side, it began at the northern inlet of the Salt Sea and extended to the banks of the Jordan.
Joshua 15:6 The boundary then went up to Beth Hoglah, passed north of Beth Arabah, and ascended to the Stone of Bohan, a landmark of the descendants of Reuben.
Joshua 15:7 It then stretched to the borders of Debir in the Valley of Achor, looking north towards Gilgal, which is on the side of the Ascent of Adummim, south of the wadi. It passed through the waters of En Shemesh—which is the Spring of the Sun. Its end point would be at En Rogel.
Joshua 15:8 After that, it went up through the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, along the southern side of the Jebusite city—this is Jerusalem. From there, it stretched to the summit of the mountain west of the Valley of Hinnom, which is on the northern side of the Valley of Rephaim.
Joshua 15:9 It then passed from the mountaintop to the Spring of Nephtoah, and reached the villages of Mount Ephron. The boundary turned towards Baalah, which is Kiriath-Jearim—meaning 'the City of Forests'.
Joshua 15:10 From Baalah, it circled westward to Mount Seir. It passed by the northern side of Mount Jearim—also known as Chesalon—then descended to Beth Shemesh, and passed through Timnah.
Joshua 15:11 It reached the northern side of Ekron, curved to Shikkeron, passed Mount Baalah, and came to Jabneel. The boundary then ended at the coast of the Great Sea.
Joshua 15:12 Thus, the Great Sea formed the western boundary. These were the boundaries for the clans of the tribe of Judah, marking their territories all around.
Joshua 15:13 But to Caleb, son of Jephunneh, a portion was given among the tribe of Judah, just as the Lord had commanded. This was Kiriath-Arba, the city of Anak's father—which is Hebron.
Joshua 15:14 From there, Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, all from the lineage of Anak.
Joshua 15:15 From there, he went up and came to the inhabitants of Debir, which was formerly called Kiriath-Sepher—meaning 'the City of Books'.
Joshua 15:16 Caleb then said, 'Whoever attacks Kiriath-Sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah, my daughter, as his wife.'
Joshua 15:17 And Othniel, son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it. So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as his wife.
Joshua 15:18 As she was leaving with her husband, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb asked her, 'What do you want?'
Joshua 15:19 She replied, 'Give me a gift. You have given me dry land, but also give me springs of water.' So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
Joshua 15:20 This then is the inheritance for the tribe of Judah, divided among their families.
Joshua 15:21 The cities in the southernmost part of the tribe of Judah, near the border of Edom, were Kabzeel, Eder, and Jagur.
Joshua 15:22 And Kinah, Dimonah, and Adadah.
Joshua 15:23 And Kadesh, Hazor, and Ithnan.
Joshua 15:24 Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth.
Joshua 15:25 And New Hazor, Kirioth Hezron—which is also called Hazor.
Joshua 15:26 Amam, Shema, and Moladah.
Joshua 15:27 And Hazar-Gaddah, Heshmon, and Beth-Pelet.
Joshua 15:28 And Hazar-Shual, Beersheba, and Bizjothiah.
Joshua 15:29 Baalah, Iim, and Ezem.
Joshua 15:30 And Eltolad, Chesil, and Hormah.
Joshua 15:31 And Ziklag, Madmannah, and Sansannah.
Joshua 15:32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon. All these cities total twenty-nine, along with their surrounding villages.
Joshua 15:33 Now in the lowlands were Eshtaol, Zorah, and Ashnah.
Joshua 15:34 And Zanoah, En-Gannim, Tappuah, and Enam.
Joshua 15:35 And Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah.
Joshua 15:36 And Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim. These fourteen cities, with their villages.
Joshua 15:37 Zenan, Hadashah, and Migdal-Gad.
Joshua 15:38 Dilean, Mizpah, and Joktheel.
Joshua 15:39 Lachish, Bozkath, and Eglon.
Joshua 15:40 And Cabbon, Lahmas, and Kithlish.
Joshua 15:1 The territory allotted to the tribe of Judah, divided among their families,
began from the southernmost limits of Coreae, extending into the desert of Sin,
and reached as far as the southern region of Kadesh-barnea.
Joshua 15:2 Their southern boundary started from the farthest reach of the Salt Sea—the Dead Sea—
at its southern tongue, which faces south.
Joshua 15:3 The boundary then went up to the Ascent of Scorpions, passed through Sena,
ascended to Kadesh-barnea, and reached Hezron.
From there, it went up to Addar and encircled Karkaa.
Joshua 15:4 From Karkaa, it continued to Azmon and reached the Brook of Egypt.
The boundary then ended at the Great Sea—the Mediterranean coast.
This entire line marked your southern border.
Joshua 15:5 The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea—the Dead Sea—extending to where the Jordan River empties into it.
The northern boundary began from the northernmost bay of the Salt Sea,
continuing along the Jordan River, in the direction that faces north.
Joshua 15:6 The boundary then went up to Beth-hoglah, passing from the north to Beth-arabah,
and ascended to the Stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben.
Joshua 15:7 From there, the boundary extended beyond the Valley of Achor to Debar,
and from Gilgal—which faces the Ascent of Adummim on the south side of the wadi—
it passed to the waters, meaning the Spring of the Sun. Its final point was the Spring of Rogel.
Joshua 15:8 Then it went up through the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, on the south side of the Jebusite territory—
which is Jerusalem. From there, it extended to the summit of the mountain opposite Gehenna on the west,
at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
Joshua 15:9 It reached the Spring of Nephtoah and the mountains of Ephron.
Then it curved towards Baalah, which is Kiriath-jearim.
Joshua 15:10 From Baalah, it circled westward to Mount Seir and passed by the northern slope of Mount Jearim—
also known as Cheslon. Then it descended to Beth-shemesh and passed through Timnah.
Joshua 15:11 It reached the northern side of Ekron, then curved to Shikkeron, and passed Mount Baalah.
It then came to Jabneel and extended to the Great Sea—the Mediterranean coast.
Joshua 15:12 The western boundary itself was the Great Sea—the Mediterranean coast.
This completes the boundary for the tribe of Judah on all sides, according to their families.
Joshua 15:13 But to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, Joshua gave a portion among the tribe of Judah,
just as the Lord had commanded him.
This was Kiriath-arba—named after Arba, the father of Anak—which is now known as Hebron.
Joshua 15:14 From that place, Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai,
who were all from the lineage of Anak.
Joshua 15:15 From there, Caleb went up and came to the inhabitants of Debir,
which was formerly called Kiriath-sepher, meaning 'the city of books' or 'city of letters'.
Joshua 15:16 And Caleb declared: 'Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it,
I will give him my daughter Achsah to be his wife.'
Joshua 15:17 Othniel, the son of Kenaz and Caleb’s younger brother, captured it.
So Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as his wife.
Joshua 15:18 As she was going with her husband, he persuaded her to ask her father for a field.
With a sigh, she dismounted from her donkey.
Caleb asked her, 'What do you want?'
Joshua 15:19 She replied: 'Give me a special gift! You have given me land in the arid south.
Please add some land with springs too.'
So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
Joshua 15:20 This is the territory of the tribe of Judah, divided among their families.
Joshua 15:21 The cities situated at the southernmost part of the tribe of Judah,
near the border of Edom, were Kabzeel, Eder, and Agur.
Joshua 15:22 And Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
Joshua 15:23 Kadesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
Joshua 15:24 Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth,
Joshua 15:25 Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth, and Hezron—which is another Hazor.
Joshua 15:26 Amam, Shema, and Moladah,
Joshua 15:27 Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, and Beth-pelet,
Joshua 15:28 Hazar-shual, Beer-sheba, and Biziothiah,
Joshua 15:29 Baalah, Iim, and Ezem,
Joshua 15:30 Eltolad, Chesil, and Hormah,
Joshua 15:31 Ziklag, Madmannah, and Sansannah,
Joshua 15:32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon.
All these cities, with their surrounding villages, total twenty-nine.
Joshua 15:33 Also in the western lowlands were Eshtaol, Zorah, and Ashnah,
Joshua 15:34 Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,
Joshua 15:35 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,
Joshua 15:36 Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and a hundred villages.
These are fourteen cities, along with their associated villages.
Joshua 15:37 Zenan, Hadashah, and Migdal-gad,
Joshua 15:38 Dilean, Mizpah, and Joktheel,
Joshua 15:39 Lachish, Bozkath, and Eglon,
Joshua 15:40 Cabbon, Lahmam, and Kitlish.
These are ten cities, along with their associated villages.
Joshua 16:1 The territory assigned to the descendants of Joseph began its border from the Jordan River, opposite Jericho and its springs. This boundary extended from Jericho into the wilderness through the mountains near Bethel.
Joshua 16:2 From Bethel, the border continued to Luz, then passed the territory of the Archites, reaching Ataroth.
Joshua 16:3 Then it descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites, extending to the borders of Lower Beth-horon and Gezer. Finally, it reached the Great Sea, also known as the Mediterranean Sea.
Joshua 16:4 Thus, the descendants of Joseph, the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, took possession of this allotted land.
Joshua 16:5 The specific boundary for the descendants of Ephraim, according to their family divisions, was established with its eastern side extending to Ataroth-addar.
Joshua 16:6 The western boundary continued northward past Michmethath. Then it turned eastward, passing by Taanath-shiloh, and from there it extended to the gate of Janoah.
Joshua 16:7 From Janoah, it descended to Ataroth and Naarah, then reached Jericho, and finally ended at the Jordan River.
Joshua 16:8 From Tappuah, the boundary extended westward to the Brook of Kanah, continuing until it reached the Great Sea.
Joshua 16:9 This described region constitutes the tribal territory belonging to the descendants of Ephraim, organized by their family clans.
Joshua 16:10 Also, there were specific cities set aside for the descendants of Ephraim, located within the territory allotted to the descendants of Manasseh, including all those cities and their associated villages.
Joshua 16:1 The territory allotted by lot to the descendants of Joseph (which included both Manasseh and Ephraim) began at the Jordan River, facing Jericho, and its spring waters from the east. This border extended through the wilderness, going up from Jericho to the mountain of Bethel.
Joshua 16:2 From Bethel (which was also known as Luzah), the boundary continued, crossing the territory of the Archites at Ataroth.
Joshua 16:3 Then it descended westward to the territory of Japhlet, extending as far as the border of lower Beth-Horon, and continuing to Gezer. The total territory of Joseph's descendants ended there, by the Great Sea to the west.
Joshua 16:4 Thus, the descendants of Joseph—Manasseh and Ephraim—took possession of their allotted land.
Joshua 16:5 Now, the specific border for the clans of the tribe of Ephraim began. Their allotted territory extended from the eastern side of Ataroth-Addar, reaching to upper Beth-Horon.
Joshua 16:6 The boundary then extended northward to the sea near Michmethath. From there, it turned eastward to Taanath-Shiloh and passed eastward from Janoah.
Joshua 16:7 From Janoah, the border descended to Ataroth and Naarath. It then extended to Jericho and finally went out to the Jordan River.
Joshua 16:8 From Tappuah, the border went westward to the Reed Valley, and its westernmost points reached the Great Sea. This describes the full possession of the tribe of Ephraim, according to its clans.
Joshua 16:9 There were also cities set aside for the descendants of Ephraim located within the territory of the descendants of Manasseh—these included all such cities and their surrounding villages.
Joshua 16:10 However, the descendants of Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer. So, the Canaanites continued to live among Ephraim's people, even until the time this record was written, and they were made to perform forced labor and pay tribute.
Joshua 17:1 A land portion was indeed allotted to the tribe of Manasseh, because Manasseh was the firstborn son of Joseph. Machir, who was Manasseh's firstborn son and the father of Gilead, was a great warrior, and his descendants had already taken possession of Gilead and Bashan.
Joshua 17:2 Then a land portion was also allotted to the rest of Manasseh's sons, each according to their family lines: for the sons of Abiezer, for the sons of Helek, for the sons of Asriel, for the sons of Shechem, for the sons of Hepher, and for the sons of Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph, listed by their family divisions.
Joshua 17:3 However, Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, who was the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
Joshua 17:4 These women came before Eleazar the priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the tribal leaders, saying: 'The Lord commanded through Moses that we should be given a land possession among our male relatives.' So Joshua, according to the Lord's command, gave them a possession among their father's relatives.
Joshua 17:5 Thus, ten portions of land were allotted to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan River.
Joshua 17:6 Indeed, there were five daughters of Manasseh who received an inheritance in the land of Canaan (these were the daughters of Zelophehad). And the remaining descendants of Manasseh obtained the land of Gilead.
Joshua 17:7 The boundary of Manasseh began from Asher, at Michmethath, which faces Shechem. It then extended eastward, toward the inhabitants of the spring of Tappuah.
Joshua 17:8 For the land of Tappuah was within the boundaries of Manasseh, but Manasseh did not claim it for itself. Instead, it belonged to the sons of Ephraim.
Joshua 17:9 The boundaries then descended into the Valley of Reeds, passing through cities that belonged to Ephraim but were located in the midst of Manasseh's territory. The northern boundary of Manasseh stretched as far as the Mediterranean Sea, and its end was in the valley.
Joshua 17:10 So Ephraim possessed territory to the south, and Manasseh to the north. Their boundary extended to the Mediterranean Sea, reaching into Asher from the north and into Issachar from the east.
Joshua 17:11 Within the territories of Issachar and Asher, Manasseh received these inherited cities: Beth-Shan and its dependent villages, Ibleam and its dependent villages. Also, the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent villages, the inhabitants of En-Dor and its dependent villages, likewise the inhabitants of Taanach and its dependent villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent villages, along with a third part of the city called Nopheth.
Joshua 17:12 However, the sons of Manasseh were not able to utterly destroy these cities. Instead, the Canaanites continued to dwell in that land.
Joshua 17:13 But after the sons of Israel grew strong, they did subdue the Canaanites and made them pay tribute; however, they did not want to utterly destroy them.
Joshua 17:14 Then the descendants of Joseph (the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh) spoke to Joshua, saying: 'Why have you given me only one portion, one lot of land, when I am such a numerous people, and the Lord has greatly blessed me?'
Joshua 17:15 Joshua answered them: 'If you are indeed a numerous people, then go up into the forest country and clear out new spaces for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaim, because the hill country of Ephraim is not large enough for your current possession.'
Joshua 17:16 The descendants of Joseph replied: 'We cannot conquer the hill country, because the Canaanites who live in the lowlands have chariots made of iron. This includes those in Beth-Shan with its surrounding towns, as well as those in the Valley of Jezreel.'
Joshua 17:17 And Joshua said to the house of Joseph, that is, to Ephraim and Manasseh: 'You are indeed a numerous people, and you possess great strength, so you will not have just one single lot of land.'
Joshua 17:18 Instead, you will cross over into the hill country and clear out spaces for yourselves. Once the land is cleared and settled, with its proper boundaries, it will be yours. For even though the Canaanites have iron chariots and are very strong, you are still able to drive them out.'
Joshua 17:1 The land portion was also assigned to the tribe of Manasseh because he was Joseph’s firstborn son, giving him a significant claim. For Machir, Manasseh's firstborn, who was the father of Gilead and a renowned leader of warriors, had already received the territories of Gilead and Bashan.
Joshua 17:2 The rest of the land was allotted to the other descendants of Manasseh, organized by their family clans: to the sons of Abiezer, to the sons of Helek, to the sons of Asriel, to the sons of Shechem, to the sons of Hepher, and to the sons of Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh, Joseph’s son, according to their family divisions.
Joshua 17:3 Now, Zelophehad, who was a descendant through Hepher, Gilead, Machir, and Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
Joshua 17:4 They came before Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and all the tribal leaders, reminding them: 'The Lord specifically commanded Moses that we, as daughters, should also be given a land possession among our father’s kinsmen.' So, according to the Lord’s command, a land possession was given to them among their father’s brothers.
Joshua 17:5 Thus, ten portions of land were measured out and allotted to the Manassite clans on the west side of the Jordan River, in addition to the territories of Gilead and Bashan which were already across the Jordan to the east.
Joshua 17:6 This division was made because the daughters of Manasseh were indeed given an inheritance among his sons, and the land of Gilead was specifically given to the remaining male descendants of Manasseh.
Joshua 17:7 The border for Manasseh started from Asher, extending to Michmethath, which is situated opposite Shechem. From there, the boundary continued eastward towards the city of En-Tappuah.
Joshua 17:8 While the area around the spring of Tappuah was allotted to the sons of Manasseh, the actual town of Tappuah itself, though close to Manasseh's border, belonged to the sons of Ephraim.
Joshua 17:9 The border then descended to the Wadi of Reeds. On the south side of this wadi were cities belonging to Ephraim, even though they were situated within Manasseh’s territory. The northern boundary of Manasseh followed the wadi, stretching out to the Great Sea and passing by a dense thicket of broom shrubs.
Joshua 17:10 This arrangement meant that the territory of Ephraim lay to the south, while Manasseh’s land was to the north. The Great Sea formed the western boundary for both tribes. Their borders then merged in the region of Zebulun, extended northward into Asher's territory, and finally crossed the Jordan River from the east.
Joshua 17:11 Within the territories of Issachar and Asher, Manasseh possessed Beth-shean along with its villages, Ibleam with its surrounding settlements, the inhabitants of Dor and their towns, the inhabitants of En-dor and their villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and their villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo with their villages, comprising a third part of the Naphath region.
Joshua 17:12 However, the sons of Manasseh were unable to completely conquer and dislodge the inhabitants of these cities. Instead, the Canaanites continued to live among them within their allotted territory.
Joshua 17:13 Later, when the sons of Israel had become stronger and more established, they did not drive out the Canaanites completely but instead subjected them to forced labor and tribute, refusing to utterly destroy them as commanded.
Joshua 17:14 Then the descendants of Joseph—the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh—spoke to Joshua, complaining: 'Why have you given us only one allotment, one single portion of land, as our inheritance? We are a very numerous people, whom the Lord has greatly blessed, and our territory is too small for us.'
Joshua 17:15 Joshua replied to them: 'If you are indeed a numerous people, then go up into the forest country and clear out new living spaces for yourselves in the land occupied by the Perizzites and the Rephaim, because the mountainous region of Ephraim is not spacious enough for you.'
Joshua 17:16 The descendants of Joseph answered, 'We are not strong enough to take control of the mountain peaks, because the Canaanites who live in the plains—including those in Beth-shean and its surrounding villages, and those in the Valley of Jezreel—possess powerful iron chariots.'
Joshua 17:17 Joshua then said to the house of Joseph, meaning Ephraim and Manasseh: 'You are indeed a numerous people, and you possess great strength. You will not be confined to just one allotted portion of land.'
Joshua 17:18 Instead, you must go into the mountainous region and clear the forests for yourselves, expanding your territory to its very limits. Even though the Canaanites possess iron chariots and are very strong, if you truly commit to driving them out, you will indeed be able to utterly defeat and destroy them.
Joshua 18:1 All the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and there they set up the Tent of Meeting, for the land had now been subdued and was under their control.
Joshua 18:2 However, seven tribes among the children of Israel had not yet received their allotted portions of land as their inheritance.
Joshua 18:3 Joshua said to them, "How long will you be sluggish and indolent, refusing to go in and take possession of the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given to you?"
Joshua 18:4 "Choose three men from each tribe among you, so that I may send them out. They are to go throughout the land and survey it, making a detailed record of it according to the needs of each tribe, and then return to me."
Joshua 18:5 "You are to divide the remaining land into seven portions for yourselves. Judah's territory is already established in the south, and the house of Joseph's territory is already in the north."
Joshua 18:6 "Then, make a descriptive record of this central land, dividing it into seven portions, and bring it here to me. I will cast lots for you before the Lord, our God, to assign each portion."
Joshua 18:7 "For the Levites will not receive a land portion among you; rather, the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance. And the tribes of Gad and Reuben, along with half the tribe of Manasseh, have already received their possessions east of the Jordan River, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave to them."
Joshua 18:8 So when the men stood up to go through the land, Joshua commanded them, saying, "Go, traverse the land, and make your descriptive record of it. Then return to me, so that I may cast lots for you here in Shiloh before the Lord."
Joshua 18:9 So the men went out, and as they passed through, they traversed the land. They made a written descriptive record of it, organized by cities and divided into seven distinct portions, and then they returned to Joshua in Shiloh.
Joshua 18:10 Then Joshua cast lots in the presence of the Lord in Shiloh, and he divided the land among the children of Israel, assigning each tribe its portion.
Joshua 18:11 The first lot drawn was for the children of Benjamin, according to their family clans, so that they might possess the land located between the territory of the children of Judah and the territory of the children of Joseph.
Joshua 18:12 Their northern boundary began at the Jordan River, running along the northern side of Jericho. From there, it ascended westward into the mountainous regions, eventually reaching the wilderness of Beth-aven.
Joshua 18:13 From there, it passed over to Luz—which is also called Bethel—along its southern side. Then it descended to Ataroth-addar, to the mountain that lies on the southern side of Lower Beth-horon.
Joshua 18:14 From there, the boundary extended, circling towards the Mediterranean Sea, to the southern side of the mountain that faces Beth-horon toward the southwest. Its termination points were at Kiriath-baal—which is also called Kiriath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah. This described the western side of Benjamin's territory.
Joshua 18:15 Now, the southern boundary began from the part of Kiriath-jearim, extending towards the Mediterranean Sea, and it reached the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
Joshua 18:16 It descended to the part of the mountain that faces the Valley of the Sons of Hinnom—which is on the northern side of the Valley of Rephaim. Then it continued down into Ge-hinnom, along the southern side of the Jebusite territory, eventually reaching the spring of Rogel.
Joshua 18:17 From there it passed northward, and went out to En-shemesh—which means "Spring of the Sun."
Joshua 18:18 It continued past the hills that are opposite the Ascent of Adummim, and then descended to Eben-bohen—which means "the Stone of Bohen," a memorial named after Bohen, the son of Reuben.
Joshua 18:19 It passed along the northern side of Beth-hoglah, and its termination points were at the northern cove of the Salt Sea, at the southern end of the Jordan River. This described the southern side of Benjamin's territory.
Joshua 18:20 The Jordan River was its boundary on the eastern side. This describes the complete circuit of the boundaries for the children of Benjamin, according to their family clans.
Joshua 18:21 The cities belonging to the children of Benjamin were: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz (also known as the Valley of Keziz),
Joshua 18:22 Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, and Bethel,
Joshua 18:23 Avvim, Parah, and Ophrah,
Joshua 18:24 Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Gaba. These were twelve cities with their surrounding villages.
Joshua 18:25 Gibeon, Ramah, and Beeroth,
Joshua 18:26 Mizpeh, Chephirah, and Mozah,
Joshua 18:27 Rekem, Irpeel, and Taralah,
Joshua 18:28 And Zelah, Ha-eleph, and Jebus—which is also known as Jerusalem—Gibeath, and Kiriath. These were fourteen cities with their surrounding villages. This completes the description of the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, according to their family clans.
Joshua 18:1 The entire assembly of the children of Israel gathered at Shiloh. There, they set up the Tabernacle of Testimony, and the land was brought under their control.
Joshua 18:2 But there still remained among the children of Israel seven tribes that had not yet received their allotted portions of the land.
Joshua 18:3 Then Joshua said to them: "How long will you neglect your duty and hesitate to take possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you?"
Joshua 18:4 "Choose three men from each tribe, so that I can send them out. They will go and survey the land, describing it according to its various regions, and then bring back to me what they have described."
Joshua 18:5 "Divide the land into seven portions for yourselves. Judah will remain within its own boundaries, and the house of Joseph will stay within its own borders."
Joshua 18:6 "You are also to describe the land in seven portions and bring it here to me, so that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord, our God."
Joshua 18:7 "For the Levites do not have a portion among you; rather, the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their possessions across the Jordan, on the eastern side, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave to them."
Joshua 18:8 When the men stood up to go and survey the land, Joshua instructed them, saying: "Go, survey the land and describe it, then return to me. Here in Shiloh, before the Lord, I will cast lots for you."
Joshua 18:9 So they went and traveled throughout the land, describing it by cities in seven portions, writing it down in a scroll. Then they returned to Joshua in Shiloh.
Joshua 18:10 There, before the Lord in Shiloh, Joshua cast lots for them and divided the land into seven portions among the children of Israel.
Joshua 18:11 And the first lot came out for the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families. Their territory extended between the land of the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
Joshua 18:12 Their northern boundary began at the Jordan, went along the side of Jericho to the north, then ascended westward, reaching the mountain in the wilderness of Bethel.
Joshua 18:13 It then crossed over to Luz, along the southern side of Luz (which is Bethel), and descended to Ataroth Addar, on the mountain south of lower Bethhoron.
Joshua 18:14 The boundary then curved and went around from the west, facing the sea, along the southern side of the mountain that overlooks Bethhoron to the southwest. Its ending points were at Cariathbaal, which is called Cariathiarim, a city of the children of Judah. This was the western side.
Joshua 18:15 From the south, starting from Cariathiarim, the boundary extended towards the sea and reached the spring of the waters of Nephtoa.
Joshua 18:16 It then descended to the side of the mountain that overlooks the valley of the children of Ennom, which is opposite the northern side of the valley of Raphaim. It descended into Geennom, alongside the Jebusite territory to the south, and reached the spring of Rogel.
Joshua 18:17 Crossing northward, it extended to Ensemames, which is the Spring of the Sun, and continued past the mounds that are opposite the ascent of Adomim.
Joshua 18:18 It descended to Abenboen, which is the stone of Boen, the son of Reuben. It then passed along the northern slopes of the Arabah, and went down into the Arabah.
Joshua 18:19 It continued past the northern side of Bethagla. Its ending points were at the northern tongue of the Salt Sea, at the southern end of the Jordan.
Joshua 18:20 These were its eastern boundaries, along the Jordan. This is the possession of the children of Benjamin, with its surrounding boundaries and individual families.
Joshua 18:21 The cities belonging to the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families, were: Jericho, Bethagla, and the Valley of Casis,
Joshua 18:22 Betharaba, Samarim, and Bethel,
Joshua 18:23 Avim, Aphara, and Ophera,
Joshua 18:24 The city of Emona, Ophni, and Gabaa: twelve cities with their villages.
Joshua 18:25 Gabaon, Rama, and Beeroth,
Joshua 18:26 Mispha, Caphara, and Amosa,
Joshua 18:27 and Recem, Jarephel, and Tharela,
Joshua 18:28 And Sela, Eleph, and Jebus (which is Jerusalem), Gabaath, and Cariath: fourteen cities with their villages. This is the possession of the children of Benjamin, according to their families.
Joshua 19:1 So the second lot was drawn, and the tribe of Simeon received their land for their clans.
Joshua 19:2 Their inheritance was within the territory already granted to the tribe of Judah.
Joshua 19:3 They received Beersheba, Sheba, and Moladah.
Joshua 19:4 And Hazar-shual, Balah, and Azem.
Joshua 19:5 Also Eltolad, Bethul, and Hormah.
Joshua 19:6 And Ziklag, Beth-marcahoth, and Hazar-susah.
Joshua 19:7 And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen. These were thirteen cities, along with their surrounding villages.
Joshua 19:8 Also Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan. These were four cities, with their surrounding villages.
Joshua 19:9 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon, for all their clans. The Simeonites received their portion within the land designated for the tribe of Judah, because the land assigned to Judah was too large for them alone, so Simeon received their inheritance from Judah's portion.
Joshua 19:10 The third lot was drawn for the tribe of Zebulun, for their clans. The boundary of their inheritance extended as far as Sarid.
Joshua 19:11 From there, the border ran westward toward the Mediterranean Sea and Maralah. It reached Dabesheth and then continued to the wadi that is east of Jokneam.
Joshua 19:12 From Sarid, the border turned eastward, toward the territory of Chisloth-tabor. From there, it went to Daberath, and then went up to Japhia.
Joshua 19:13 From there, it continued eastward to Gath-hepher and Eth-kazin, then went on to Rimmon, which curves toward Neah.
Joshua 19:14 The border then circled north of Hannathon, and its boundary extended to the Valley of Iphtahel.
Joshua 19:15 It also included Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. There were twelve cities, with their surrounding villages.

Joshua 19:18 Their territory included Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem.
Joshua 19:19 And Hapharaim, Shihon, and Anaharath.

Joshua 19:21 And Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez.
Joshua 19:22 The boundary extended to Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh. The eastern end of their territory reached the Jordan River. There were sixteen cities, with their surrounding villages.

Joshua 19:24 The fifth lot was drawn for the tribe of Asher, for their clans.
Joshua 19:25 Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, and Achshaph.
Joshua 19:26 And Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. It reached Mount Carmel in the west, and Shihor-libnath.
Joshua 19:27 The border then turned eastward to Beth-dagon, and touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel on the north, then Beth-emek and Neiel, and extended to Cabul on the left side.
Joshua 19:28 It also included Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon.
Joshua 19:29 The border then turned back to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre. It then turned to Hosah, and its boundary reached the Mediterranean Sea from the district of Achzib.
Joshua 19:30 It also included Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob. There were twenty-two cities, with their surrounding villages.
Joshua 19:31 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Asher, for their clans, including their cities and their villages.
Joshua 19:32 The sixth lot was drawn for the tribe of Naphtali, for their clans.
Joshua 19:33 Their border started from Heleph, from the oak tree in Zaanannim, and Adami, which is Nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and its eastern end reached the Jordan River.
Joshua 19:34 The border then turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and from there it went to Hukkok. It reached Zebulun on the south, and Asher on the west, and Judah on the Jordan River on the east.
Joshua 19:35 The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth.
Joshua 19:36 And Adamah, Ramah, and Hazor.
Joshua 19:37 And Kedesh, Edrei, and En-hazor.
Joshua 19:38 And Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh. These were nineteen cities, with their surrounding villages.
Joshua 19:39 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali, for their clans, including their cities and their villages.
Joshua 19:40 The seventh lot was drawn for the tribe of Dan, for their clans.
Joshua 19:1 The second lot of territory then fell to the tribe of Simeon, based on their families and clans. Their allotted inheritance was situated within the existing territory of the tribe of Judah.
Joshua 19:2 The cities they received as their possession included Beersheba, Sheba, and Moladah,
Joshua 19:3 along with Hazar-shual, Balah, and Azem,
Joshua 19:4 and Eltolad, Bethul, and Hormah,
Joshua 19:5 and Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,
Joshua 19:6 and Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen. This portion included thirteen cities and all of their surrounding villages.
Joshua 19:7 Also, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan. These four cities, with their villages, were also part of Simeon's inheritance.
Joshua 19:8 All the villages surrounding these cities, stretching as far as Baalath Beer-Ramath in the region of the Negev desert, were also theirs. This entire portion was the inheritance given to the tribe of Simeon, according to their families and clans.
Joshua 19:9 The cities that Simeon received as their inheritance were allotted from the portion of land originally assigned to the tribe of Judah. This was because Judah's territory was quite extensive, and so Simeon’s people were given their possession within Judah's assigned land.
Joshua 19:10 The third lot of territory then fell to the sons of Zebulun, based on their families and clans. The boundary of their inheritance extended as far as Sarid.
Joshua 19:11 From there, their boundary went up from the sea, by Maralah, and reached Dabbasheth. It continued to the wadi that lies opposite Jokneam.
Joshua 19:12 From Sarid, it turned eastward toward the border of Chisloth-Tabor, and from there it proceeded to Daberath, and then ascended to Japhia.
Joshua 19:13 From Japhia, it continued to Gath-hepher and Eth-kazin, and then went out to Rimmon-Methoar and Neah.
Joshua 19:14 The boundary then encircled it on the north side at Hannathon, with its extremities extending into the Valley of Iphtahel.
Joshua 19:15 Included were Kattah, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. In total, there were twelve cities and all their surrounding villages.
Joshua 19:16 This was the inheritance given to the tribe of Zebulun, based on their families and clans, including all the cities and their surrounding villages.

Joshua 19:25 Their boundary included Helkath, Hali, Beten, and Achshaph,
Joshua 19:26 and Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph again, along with Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal. The boundary extended as far as Mount Carmel, which is by the sea, and to the stream of Shihor-Libnath.
Joshua 19:27 The boundary then turned eastward to Beth-dagon and reached as far as the territory of Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel to the north, extending to Beth-emek and Neiel. It then proceeded to Cabul, towards its left (or northern) side.
Joshua 19:28 Also, Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, with the boundary extending all the way to the great city of Sidon.
Joshua 19:29 The boundary of their allotted territory then turned towards Hosah, extending as far as the strongly fortified city of Tyre. Its limits then stretched out to the sea from the region of Achzib.
Joshua 19:30 Also, Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob were included. In total, there were twenty-two cities and all their surrounding villages.

Joshua 19:33 Their boundary began from Heleph, from Elon-bezaanannim, and Adami-nekeb, and extended to Jabneel, as far as Lakkum. Its limits then reached to the Jordan River.
Joshua 19:34 The boundary then turned westward to Aznoth-Tabor, and from there it proceeded to Hukkok. It passed through the territory of Zebulun towards the south, and through the territory of Asher towards the west, and through the territory of Judah towards the Jordan River on the east.
Joshua 19:35 Among their fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
Joshua 19:36 and Adamah, Ramah, and Hazor,
Joshua 19:37 and Kedesh, Edrei, and En-hazor,
Joshua 19:38 and Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh. In total, there were nineteen cities and all their surrounding villages.

Joshua 19:40 The seventh lot of territory was then given to the tribe of the sons of Dan, based on their families and clans.
Joshua 20:1 The Lord spoke to Joshua, saying:
Joshua 20:2 “Speak to the children of Israel and say: ‘Set aside for yourselves the cities of refuge, about which I spoke to you through Moses.’”
Joshua 20:3 “So that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee to them, and not be guilty of the blood of those whose relative is close to avenge them.”
Joshua 20:4 “When he flees to one of these cities, he will stand at the gate of the city and speak his case to the elders of that city; and they will take him into the city and give him a place to live.”
Joshua 20:5 “And if the avenger of the slain man's blood enters the city, they will not hand over the killer to him; because he struck his neighbor without intending to, and it is proven that he held no hatred against him before this event.”
Joshua 20:6 “And he will remain in that city until he stands before the judgment of the people, and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then the killer will return and go to his own home, to the city and place from which he had fled.”
Joshua 20:7 So they consecrated Kedesh in Galilee, in the mountain region of Naphtali, and Shechem in the mountain region of Ephraim, and Kiriath-Arba, which is Hebron, in the mountain region of Judah.
Joshua 20:8 And across the Jordan, opposite Jericho, on the eastern side, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain, from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 20:9 These cities were designated for all the children of Israel and for the foreigners who dwelled among them, so that anyone who killed a person unintentionally might flee to them, and not die at the hand of the avenger of blood, who sought vengeance, until he stood before the assembly for judgment.
Joshua 20:1 The Lord then spoke to Joshua, giving him this command:
Joshua 20:2 "Speak to the children of Israel and tell them: 'Set aside the cities of refuge, those which I spoke about to you through Moses,
Joshua 20:3 so that anyone who unintentionally kills another person, without knowing it, can flee to them. Such a person will not be considered guilty of murder by the avenger of blood—the relative who seeks vengeance for the deceased.
Joshua 20:4 When someone flees to one of these cities, he is to stand at the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city, proving his innocence. They will then receive him and give him a place to live among them.
Joshua 20:5 If the avenger of blood pursues him, the elders must not hand over the manslayer to his custody. This is because the manslayer killed his neighbor unintentionally and without any prior hatred towards him.
Joshua 20:6 He is to remain in that city until he stands before the judgment of the community regarding his case, and he must stay there until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Only then may he return and go back to his own city and home from which he fled.
Joshua 20:7 So they consecrated Kedesh in Galilee, located in the mountainous region of Naphtali; and Shechem in the mountainous region of Ephraim; and Kiriath-Arba, which is Hebron, in the mountainous region of Judah.
Joshua 20:8 And across the Jordan River, to the east of Jericho, beyond all the eastern plains, they designated Bezer in the wilderness, a city on the plain from the tribe of Reuben; and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad; and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 20:9 These cities were appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the foreigners who lived among them, so that anyone who unintentionally caused a person's death could flee to them. This ensured they would not die by the hand of the avenger of blood before they could stand trial before the community.
Joshua 21:1 Then the heads of the Levitical families approached Eleazar the priest, and Joshua, son of Nun, and the tribal leaders from each tribe of the sons of Israel, in Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
Joshua 21:2 And they spoke to them, saying, “The Lord commanded through Moses that cities should be given to us for our habitation, along with their pasturelands for our livestock.”
Joshua 21:3 So the sons of Israel gave from their own tribal territories, according to the Lord’s command, these cities and their surrounding pasturelands.
Joshua 21:4 And the first lot was drawn for the families of Kohath. The sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Kohathite lineage of the Levites, received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah, and from the tribe of Simeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin.
Joshua 21:5 To the rest of the sons of Kohath, that is, the Levites of their families, ten cities were given from the tribe of Ephraim, and from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 21:6 Furthermore, to the sons of Gershon, according to their families, thirteen cities were given from the tribe of Issachar, and from the tribe of Asher, and from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
Joshua 21:7 And to the sons of Merari, according to their families, twelve cities were given from the tribe of Reuben, and from the tribe of Gad, and from the tribe of Zebulun.
Joshua 21:8 So the sons of Israel gave to the Levites these cities and their pasturelands, just as the Lord had commanded through Moses, by casting lots.
Joshua 21:9 From the tribes of the sons of Judah and Simeon, they gave these cities, whose names are as follows:
Joshua 21:10 They were cities for Aaron, from the families of Kohath, of the lineage of Levi, because their lot came up first.
Joshua 21:11 They gave Kirjath Arba—the city of Arba, father of Anak—which is also called Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, and its pasturelands all around it.
Joshua 21:12 However, the fields and the villages around Hebron, they had given to Caleb, son of Jephunneh, for his possession.
Joshua 21:13 Therefore, to the sons of Aaron the priest, they gave Hebron, and Libnah, and Jattir, and Eshtemoa,
Joshua 21:14 and Holon, and Debir,
Joshua 21:15 and Ashan, and Jutta, and Beth Shemesh, with their pasturelands: these nine cities from these two tribes.
Joshua 21:16 From the tribe of Benjamin, they gave Gibeon, and Geba, and Anathoth, and Almon, with their pasturelands: four cities.
Joshua 21:17 All thirteen cities, with their pasturelands, they gave to the sons of Aaron the priest.
Joshua 21:18 To the rest of the Kohathite Levites, from the tribe of Ephraim, they gave these cities and their pasturelands: Shechem, a city of refuge, and Gezer,
Joshua 21:19 and Kibzaim, and Beth Horon, with their pasturelands: four cities.
Joshua 21:20 Also from the tribe of Dan, they gave Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Aijalon, and Gath Rimmon, with their pasturelands: four cities.
Joshua 21:21 From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Taanach, and Gath Rimmon, with their pasturelands: two cities.
Joshua 21:22 All ten cities, and their pasturelands, were given to the remaining sons of Kohath.
Joshua 21:23 To the sons of Gershon, from the lineage of Levi, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave these cities of refuge: Golan in Bashan, and Beeshterah, with their pasturelands: two cities.
Joshua 21:24 From the tribe of Issachar, they gave Kishion, and Dabareh, and Jarmuth, and En Gannim, with their pasturelands: four cities.
Joshua 21:25 From the tribe of Asher, they gave Mishal, and Abdon, and Helkath, and Rehob, with their pasturelands: four cities.
Joshua 21:26 From the tribe of Naphtali, they gave Kedesh in Galilee, a city of refuge, and Hammon-dor, and Kiriathaim, with their pasturelands: four cities.
Joshua 21:27 All thirteen cities, and their pasturelands, were given to the sons of Gershon according to their families.
Joshua 21:28 To the sons of Merari, the Levites, according to their families, from the tribe of Zebulun, they gave Jokneam, and Kartah, and Dimnah, and Nahalal, with their pasturelands: four cities.
Joshua 21:29 From the tribe of Reuben beyond the Jordan River, they gave Bezer, and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, with their pasturelands: four cities.
Joshua 21:30 From the tribe of Gad, they gave Ramoth in Gilead, a city of refuge, and Mahanaim, and Heshbon, and Jazer, with their pasturelands: four cities.
Joshua 21:31 These are the twelve cities for the sons of Merari, according to their families.
Joshua 21:32 All the cities for the Levites, within the territory of the sons of Israel, were forty-eight, along with their pasturelands.
Joshua 21:33 Each one of these cities had its own pasturelands surrounding it.
Joshua 21:34 So all the work that the Lord had spoken to Moses, concerning giving the land to the sons of Israel, was now completed. And they possessed the land.
Joshua 21:35 They entered into the land and settled in their assigned territories, and throughout all their borders.
Joshua 21:36 Not one of the many good promises that the Lord had made to the sons of Israel failed; every single one was fulfilled.
Joshua 21:37 These are their assigned territories according to their families.
Joshua 21:38 From the cities and their pasturelands that the sons of Aaron the priest received, who were of the lineage of Kohathite Levites, there were nineteen cities.
Joshua 21:39 But to the rest of the Kohathites, that is, the Levites, there were twenty-two cities.
Joshua 21:40 And to the Gershonite sons, thirty-six cities.
Joshua 21:1 Then the heads of the Levitical families went to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua, the son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of each of the other tribes.
Joshua 21:2 They spoke to them in Shiloh, in the land of Canaan, saying: “The Lord commanded through Moses that we should be given cities to live in, along with their surrounding lands for the pasture of our livestock.”
Joshua 21:3 So the sons of Israel, according to the Lord’s command, gave cities and their surrounding lands from their own possessions to the Levites.
Joshua 21:4 The lot then came out for the families of Kohath. The sons of Aaron, who were priests, received thirteen cities from the tribal territories of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.
Joshua 21:5 For the rest of the sons of Kohath—the Levites who were not priests—ten cities were given from the tribal territories of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 21:6 To the sons of Gershon, thirteen cities were given from the tribal territories of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the other half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 21:7 And to the sons of Merari, according to their family clans, twelve cities were given from the tribal territories of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
Joshua 21:8 So the sons of Israel gave these cities and their surrounding lands to the Levites by lot, just as the Lord had commanded through Joshua.
Joshua 21:9 These are the names of the cities that were given from the tribal territory of the sons of Judah and from the tribal territory of the sons of Simeon:
Joshua 21:10 These cities were for the sons of Aaron from the families of Kohath, who were from the tribe of Levi, because their lot had been chosen first.
Joshua 21:11 They received Kiriath-Arba, which is the city of Arba, the father of Anak—this city is Hebron in the mountainous region of Judah—along with its surrounding pasture lands.
Joshua 21:12 However, the fields and villages surrounding Hebron had already been given to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, for his possession.
Joshua 21:13 Therefore, to the sons of Aaron the priest, they gave Hebron, a city of refuge, along with its pasture lands. They also gave Libnah with its pasture lands,
Joshua 21:14 and Jattir, and Eshtemoa, and Holon, and Debir, and Ain, and Juttah, and Beth-Shemesh, each with their pasture lands. That makes nine cities from these two tribes.
Joshua 21:15 From the tribe of Benjamin, they received Gibeon and Geba, Anathoth and Almon, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.
Joshua 21:16 All these cities for the sons of Aaron, the priests, totalled thirteen, each with its surrounding pasture lands.
Joshua 21:17 Now for the remaining Levites of the Kohathite families, from the tribe of Ephraim, they gave Shechem—a city of refuge in the mountainous region of Ephraim—along with its pasture lands. Also Gezer with its pasture lands,
Joshua 21:18 and Kibzaim with its pasture lands, and Beth-Horon with its pasture lands. That makes four cities.
Joshua 21:19 From the tribe of Dan, they received Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Aijalon, and Gath-Rimmon, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.
Joshua 21:20 From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they received Taanach and Gath-Rimmon, each with their pasture lands. That makes two cities.
Joshua 21:21 All these cities, totalling ten with their pasture lands, were given to the other, non-priestly, sons of Kohath.
Joshua 21:22 For the sons of Gershon, from the clan of Levi, from the other half-tribe of Manasseh, they received Bezer—a city of refuge—and Bosra with its pasture lands.
Joshua 21:23 And from the tribe of Issachar, they received Kishion and Daberath, and Jarmuth, and En-Gannim, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.
Joshua 21:24 This verse seems to be a slight textual variant of the previous one, listing cities for Issachar. It means: From the tribe of Issachar, they received Kishion, Daberath, Jarmuth, and En-Gannim, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.
Joshua 21:25 From the tribe of Asher, they received Mishal, and Abdon, and Helkath, and Rehob, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.
Joshua 21:26 From the tribe of Naphtali, they received Kedesh in Galilee—a city of refuge—and Hammoth-Dor, and Kartan, each with their pasture lands. That makes three cities.
Joshua 21:27 All these cities for the sons of Gershon, according to their families, totalled thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
Joshua 21:28 For the sons of Merari, Levites according to their families, from the tribe of Zebulun, they received Jokneam, and Kartah, and Rimmon, and Nahalal, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.
Joshua 21:29 From the tribe of Reuben, they received Bezer, and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.
Joshua 21:30 From the tribe of Gad, they received Ramoth in Gilead—a city of refuge—and Mahanaim, and Heshbon, and Jazer, each with their pasture lands. That makes four cities.
Joshua 21:31 These are the cities for the sons of Merari according to their clans, totalling twelve cities.
Joshua 21:32 All the cities of the Levites, within the possession of the sons of Israel, amounted to forty-eight cities, each with its surrounding pasture lands.
Joshua 21:33 These were the specific cities, each with their pasture lands all around them.
Joshua 21:34 And the Lord gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their fathers. The children of Israel took possession of the entire land and settled in it.
Joshua 21:35 No enemy dared to resist them; rather, all the surrounding nations were subjected to their rule.
Joshua 21:36 Not one thing failed of all the good promises the Lord had spoken to the house of Israel. Everything was fulfilled.
Joshua 21:37 These are the cities which the Lord gave to the sons of Israel,
Joshua 21:38 according to the division of the four tribes listed above.
Joshua 21:39 And the Lord gave them peace in all their borders, and He removed their enemies from them, just as He had sworn to their fathers.
Joshua 21:40 Everything was fulfilled, just as the Lord had sworn. And the Lord gave them their land.
Joshua 22:1 Then Joshua called the descendants of Reuben, and the descendants of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Joshua 22:2 And he said to them: "You have done everything that Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you. You have also obeyed me in all things.
Joshua 22:3 You have not abandoned your brothers for a very long time, even to this present day, guarding the command of the Lord your God.
Joshua 22:4 Now, therefore, return and go to your homes in the land you possess, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave to you across the Jordan River."
Joshua 22:5 "But be careful to diligently keep and completely fulfill the commandment and the law that Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you: that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all His ways, and observe His commands, and cling to Him, and serve Him in all worship and in every work."
Joshua 22:6 And Joshua blessed them and sent them away. So they returned to their homes.
Joshua 22:7 Moses had also given a possession in Bashan to half of the tribe of Manasseh. And therefore, to the remaining half-portion, Joshua gave an inheritance among their other brothers on the west side of the Jordan River. When he sent them away to their homes, and had blessed them,
Joshua 22:8 he said to them: "Return to your settlements with much wealth and riches, with silver and gold, bronze and iron, and many garments. Divide the spoil taken from your enemies with your brothers."
Joshua 22:9 So the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from the sons of Israel, from Shiloh, which is located in the land of Canaan. They went to enter Gilead, the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the command of the Lord through Moses.
Joshua 22:10 When they came to the Jordan River banks, in the land of Canaan, they built a very large altar near the Jordan.
Joshua 22:11 And the sons of Israel heard a widely spread report that the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar in the land of Canaan, on the banks of the Jordan, facing the sons of Israel.
Joshua 22:12 And all the sons of Israel gathered at Shiloh, intending to go up and fight against them.
Joshua 22:13 Meanwhile, they sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead.
Joshua 22:14 And with him were ten princes, one from each of the tribes of Israel, men who were heads of their families.
Joshua 22:15 When they came to the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead, they spoke to them, saying:
Joshua 22:16 "Thus says the entire assembly of the Lord: 'What is this transgression? Why have you abandoned the Lord, the God of Israel, by building a sacrilegious altar, and withdrawing from His worship?'"
Joshua 22:17 "Is it not enough for us that we sinned at Baal-Peor, and the wickedness remains to this present day, and because of this a plague came upon the Lord's people?
Joshua 22:18 And if you today abandon the Lord, tomorrow His wrath will rage against all of Israel."
Joshua 22:19 "But if you think that the land you possess is unclean, cross over to the land where the Lord's Tabernacle is, and live among us. Only do not depart from the Lord and from our fellowship by building an altar other than the altar of the Lord our God.
Joshua 22:20 Did not Achan, the son of Zerah, commit a transgression against the Lord's command, and His wrath fell upon all the people of Israel? And he was just one man, and if only he had perished alone in his wickedness!"
Joshua 22:21 And the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the princes of Israel's delegation:
Joshua 22:22 "The Lord, the Mighty God! The Lord, the Mighty God! He Himself knows, and Israel, you also understand: if with an intention of transgression or contempt for the Lord we have erected this altar, do not spare us.
Joshua 22:23 Rather, let Him Himself take vengeance on you. And if we did this with the intention of placing burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings upon it, may we be accursed.
Joshua 22:24 But we acted out of concern, fearing this, and considering what your children might say to our children in the future: 'What do you have to do with the Lord, the God of Israel?'
Joshua 22:25 The Lord has placed a boundary between us and you, O sons of Reuben and Gad, the Jordan River. And therefore, you have no part in the Lord.' And thus your children might turn our children away from worshipping the Lord.
Joshua 22:26 For this reason, we said: 'Let us build an altar for ourselves, not for burnt offerings, nor for offering sacrifices,
Joshua 22:27 but as a witness between us and you, and our descendants, that we may serve the Lord and frequently observe His worship with burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings.' This way, your children will never again say to our children: 'You have no share in the Lord.'"
Joshua 22:28 "And if ever they wish to say this, you will answer them: 'Behold the altar of the Lord which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices, but as a witness for us and for you.'"
Joshua 22:29 "Far be it from us to depart from the Lord, and to abandon His worship, by building an altar for offering burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and peace offerings, apart from the altar of the Lord our God, which is established before His Tabernacle."
Joshua 22:30 When they heard this, Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the Israelite delegation who were with him, were appeased.
Joshua 22:31 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to the Reubenites and Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh: "Today we know that the Lord is with us, because you have not followed this counsel of transgression, and you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of the Lord."
Joshua 22:32 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes returned from the sons of Reuben and Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and reported the words to them.
Joshua 22:33 And the report pleased all who heard it. And they praised God, and no longer attempted to go up against them and fight.
Joshua 22:34 And the sons of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built the altar, and they called it "Witness", because it was a witness that the Lord Himself is God.
Joshua 22:1 Then Joshua called for the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half of the tribe of Manasseh,
Joshua 22:2 and said to them: "You have done everything that Moses, the Lord's servant, commanded you; and you have also obeyed me in everything I commanded you.
Joshua 22:3 You have not abandoned your brothers for a long time, even until this very day, carefully observing the commands of the Lord your God.
Joshua 22:4 Now, therefore, return and go to your homes, to the land of your inheritance which Moses, the Lord's servant, gave you beyond the Jordan River.
Joshua 22:5 However, make sure you carefully observe and fulfill the command and the law that Moses, the Lord's servant, commanded you: to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commands, and to hold fast to Him, serving Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
Joshua 22:6 Joshua then called them together and blessed them.
Joshua 22:7 And to the two tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given an inheritance in Bashan. Because of this, Joshua gave the other half of Manasseh their share of the land on the other side of the Jordan River, on the western side.
Joshua 22:8 And when he sent them away and commanded them to go to their homes, he said to them: "Return to your homes with much wealth and riches, with silver and gold and bronze and iron and many garments. Divide the spoils of your plunder with your brothers.
Joshua 22:9 So the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh returned and departed from the other sons of Israel, from Shiloh which is in Canaan. They went to enter Gilead, the land of their inheritance, which they had obtained according to the command of the Lord through Moses.
Joshua 22:10 When they came to the Jordan's banks, in the land of Canaan, they built a very large altar by the Jordan.
Joshua 22:11 And the other sons of Israel heard a report, saying: "The sons of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar opposite the land of Canaan, in the region of the Jordan, facing the other sons of Israel."
Joshua 22:12 When they heard this, all the sons of Israel gathered at Shiloh, intending to go up and fight against them.
Joshua 22:13 However, they first sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the sons of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead.
Joshua 22:14 They also sent ten chiefs with him, one from each tribe, who were heads of their families from all the tribes of Israel.
Joshua 22:15 When these men came to the sons of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead, they spoke to them,
Joshua 22:16 saying: "This is what the entire assembly of the Lord commands: 'What is this transgression by which you have violated the command of the Lord God of Israel, building a sacrilegious altar and turning away from His worship?'
Joshua 22:17 Is the sin of Peor not enough for you, for which, even to this present day, a great plague and calamity came upon the Lord's people?
Joshua 22:18 And now you are again abandoning the Lord, so that tomorrow His wrath will be stirred up against all Israel?
Joshua 22:19 If you think the land of your inheritance is unclean, then cross over to the land where the Lord's Tabernacle is, and live among us. Do not build another altar besides the altar of the Lord our God.
Joshua 22:20 Did not Achan, the son of Zerah, violate the Lord's command, and His wrath fell upon all Israel? He was only one man, and would that he alone had perished in his wickedness!"
Joshua 22:21 Then the sons of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh answered the chiefs of the Israelite delegation,
Joshua 22:22 saying: "The Lord God knows, and let Israel itself understand: If we built this altar with an intention of transgression or contempt for the Lord, may He not spare us today!
Joshua 22:23 But if we did it with the intention of placing burnt offerings, sacrifices, or peace offerings upon it, may He Himself investigate and judge.
Joshua 22:24 Did we not rather do this with a certain thought and concern, saying: 'Lest perhaps your sons say to our sons tomorrow: What do you have to do with the Lord God of Israel?
Joshua 22:25 The Lord has set the Jordan River as a boundary between us and you, O sons of Reuben and sons of Gad. Therefore, you have no portion in the Lord. And by this occasion, your sons might turn our sons away from fearing the Lord.
Joshua 22:26 Therefore we said: 'Let us build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offerings nor for sacrificing victims,
Joshua 22:27 but as a witness between us and you and our descendants and yours, that we may serve the Lord and fulfill His worship, and that we may continually offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. This is so that your sons may never say to our sons tomorrow: You have no portion in the Lord.'
Joshua 22:28 And if they should desire to say so, our sons will respond to them: 'Behold the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice, but as a witness for us and for you.'
Joshua 22:29 Far be this wickedness from us, that we should withdraw from the Lord and abandon His worship, by building an altar for burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings, other than the altar of the Lord our God, which is before His Tabernacle!"
Joshua 22:30 When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the Israelite delegation who were with him heard these things, they were appeased. And they understood that the sons of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh had not built the altar out of their own design, but out of fear of future generations separating from God.
Joshua 22:31 Then Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to them: "Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this crime, and you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of the Lord."
Joshua 22:32 So Phinehas and the chiefs returned from the sons of Reuben and Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the other sons of Israel, and reported their words to them.
Joshua 22:33 The report pleased all who heard it. And the sons of Israel praised God, and they no longer spoke of going up and fighting against them and destroying the land of their inheritance.
Joshua 22:34 And the sons of Reuben and Gad called the altar they had built "Witness," because it was a witness that the Lord Himself is God.
Joshua 23:1 Much later, after the Lord had given Israel a time of peace from all their surrounding enemies, and Joshua had grown old, and his age had advanced significantly,
Joshua 23:2 Joshua called together all of Israel—their elders, their leaders, their judges, and their officers. He then said to them: "I have become old, and my life's journey has advanced and moved forward past my youth.
Joshua 23:3 You yourselves have seen all the Lord your God has done for this nation, and for all the nations around you. You have seen how He Himself fought for you.
Joshua 23:4 Now, because He has divided among you the assigned portions of all these lands, from the Jordan River to the Great Sea (the Mediterranean), and from where the sun rises in the east to where it sets in the west, and has given them to you by lot, just as the Lord your God commanded you,
Joshua 23:5 The Lord your God Himself will drive them out before you. He will overturn them from your path, and you will take possession of their lands, just as He promised you.
Joshua 23:6 Therefore, strengthen yourselves and be careful to keep and perform all that is written in the book of the Law of Moses. Do not deviate from these commands, neither to the right nor to the left.
Joshua 23:7 Do not even mix with these nations that remain among you. Do not mention the names of their false gods, nor swear by them, nor serve them, nor worship them.
Joshua 23:8 Instead, cling steadfastly to the Lord your God, just as you have done up to this present day.
Joshua 23:9 And then, the Lord will drive out before you great and very strong nations. No one will be able to resist you.
Joshua 23:10 One man among you will pursue a thousand men. This will happen because the Lord your God Himself will fight for you, just as He promised.
Joshua 23:11 Just be sure of this: that you love the Lord your God.
Joshua 23:12 But if you choose to turn away and cling to the remnants of these nations that are among you, and join yourselves to them, and intermarry with them,
Joshua 23:13 know for certain that then the Lord your God will not drive them out from before you. Instead, they will become for you a pit and a snare, a stumbling block at your side, and thorns in your eyes, until He removes you and utterly destroys you from this good land that He has given you.
Joshua 23:14 Behold, today I am going the way of all the earth (meaning, I am about to die). And you know in all your heart and in all your soul that not one of all the good promises which the Lord your God spoke concerning you has failed; not one of them has proven void.
Joshua 23:15 But just as all the good things that the Lord your God spoke to you have been fulfilled in deed, both good and evil, so also the Lord will bring upon you every evil He has spoken, until He removes you and utterly destroys you from this good land that He has given you.
Joshua 23:16 When you transgress the covenant of the Lord your God, which He made with you, and you serve foreign gods and worship them, immediately the wrath of the Lord will rise against you. You will then swiftly be removed from this good land that He has given you.
Joshua 24:1 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together in Shechem. He called all the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of the people to come, and they stood before the presence of the Lord.
Joshua 24:2 Then Joshua said to all the people: "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Your ancestors, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived across the Euphrates River from the very beginning, and they worshipped false gods.
Joshua 24:3 But I took your father Abraham from the region of Mesopotamia and led him into the land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants, and I gave him Isaac.
Joshua 24:4 To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the land of Mount Seir to possess as his own, but Jacob and his sons eventually went down into Egypt.
Joshua 24:5 Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I punished Egypt with many miraculous signs and wonders.
Joshua 24:6 And I brought you and your fathers out of Egypt, and you arrived at the sea. The Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and cavalry all the way to the Red Sea.
Joshua 24:7 You cried out to the Lord, and He placed a thick darkness between you and the Egyptians. Then He brought the sea over them and drowned them. Your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Afterwards, you lived in the wilderness for a very long time.
Joshua 24:8 Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan River. When they fought against you, I gave them into your hands, and you took possession of their land and utterly destroyed them.
Joshua 24:9 Then Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab, rose up and fought against Israel. He sent for and summoned Balaam, the son of Beor, to put a curse on you.
Joshua 24:10 But I refused to listen to Balaam. Instead, I used him to bless you, and so I delivered you from Balak's power.
Joshua 24:11 Then you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, along with the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Jebusites, and Hivites. But I delivered them into your hands.
Joshua 24:12 I sent the hornets before you, and they drove out the two kings of the Amorites from their lands—not by your own sword, nor by your bow.
Joshua 24:13 I gave you a land for which you had not labored, and cities that you had not built, so that you might live in them. I also gave you vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.
Joshua 24:14 Now therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him with an undivided and most sincere heart. Cast away from among you the false gods that your fathers served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord only.
Joshua 24:15 But if it seems wrong to you to serve the Lord, then choose for yourselves today whom you will serve instead: either the gods that your fathers served in Mesopotamia, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are now living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.
Joshua 24:16 Then the people answered and said: "It is unthinkable for us to abandon the Lord and serve other gods!
Joshua 24:17 For the Lord our God is the one who brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery. He performed mighty signs before our very eyes and preserved us throughout all the journey we undertook, and among all the peoples through whom we passed.
Joshua 24:18 He also drove out all the nations from before us, even the Amorites who lived in the land that we were entering. Therefore, we too will serve the Lord, for He alone is our God."
Joshua 24:19 Then Joshua said to the people: "You will not be able to serve the Lord truly, because He is a holy God, a strong God, and a jealous God. He will not overlook your wicked deeds or your sins.
Joshua 24:20 If you abandon the Lord and serve foreign gods, He will turn against you, bring disaster upon you, and utterly destroy you, even after all the good He has done for you."
Joshua 24:21 But the people said to Joshua, "No! We will certainly serve the Lord!"
Joshua 24:22 Joshua then said to the people, "You yourselves are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord to serve Him." And they answered, "We are witnesses."
Joshua 24:23 Then Joshua said, "Now, therefore, remove the foreign gods that are among you, and turn your hearts fully to the Lord, the God of Israel."
Joshua 24:24 The people said to Joshua, "We will serve the Lord our God, and we will obey His voice."
Joshua 24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and he laid out statutes and ordinances for them in Shechem.
Joshua 24:26 Joshua wrote all these words in the book of the Law of the Lord. Then he took a very large stone and set it up there under the oak tree that was by the sanctuary of the Lord.
Joshua 24:27 And he said to all the people: "Look, this stone will be a witness against you, for it has heard all the words that the Lord spoke to us. It will stand as a reminder, lest you later deny and lie to the Lord your God."
Joshua 24:28 So Joshua sent the people away, each person to their own inherited land.
Joshua 24:29 After these events, Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of one hundred and ten years.
Joshua 24:30 They buried him within the borders of his own inherited land at Timnath-serah, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.
Joshua 24:31 Israel served the Lord throughout all the days of Joshua, and throughout all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had known all the great works that the Lord had done for Israel.
Joshua 24:32 The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had carried up from Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of the field that Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred young lambs. This place became the possession of the descendants of Joseph.
Joshua 24:33 Eleazar also, the son of Aaron, died. They buried him in Gibeah, the town of his son Phinehas, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.
Joshua 24:1 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together in Shechem, and he called all their elders, their leaders, their judges, and their officers to assemble. And they presented themselves before the presence of the Lord.
Joshua 24:2 Then Joshua spoke to all the people, saying, 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Your ancestors lived beyond the River Euphrates from the earliest times. This included Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor. And they served other gods there.''
Joshua 24:3 So I took your ancestor Abraham from the land of Mesopotamia and brought him into the land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants, and I gave him Isaac.
Joshua 24:4 And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess as his own, but Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt.
Joshua 24:5 Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with many miraculous signs and wonders, just as it is written. And I led you and your ancestors out of Egypt.
Joshua 24:6 And you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued your ancestors with chariots and horsemen all the way to the Red Sea.
Joshua 24:7 Then your ancestors cried out to the Lord. He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and He brought the sea over them and drowned them. Your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt, and you lived in the wilderness for a long time.
Joshua 24:8 Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who lived beyond the Jordan River. When they fought against you, I handed them over into your power, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.
Joshua 24:9 Then Balak, the son of Zippor, who was the king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent for and summoned Balaam, the son of Beor, so that he might curse you.
Joshua 24:10 But I would not listen to Balaam. Instead, I blessed you completely, and I delivered you from his hand.
Joshua 24:11 Then you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your power.
Joshua 24:12 I sent hornets before you, and they drove out the two kings of the Amorites from their places, not by your sword or by your bow.
Joshua 24:13 And I gave you a land for which you had not toiled, and cities that you had not built, so that you might live in them. And I gave you vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant, from which you now eat.
Joshua 24:14 Now, therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him with a perfect heart and with truth. Remove the gods whom your ancestors served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord alone.
Joshua 24:15 But if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, then choose for yourselves today whom you wish to serve. Will it be the gods whom your ancestors served in Mesopotamia, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you now live? As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.
Joshua 24:16 And the people answered and said: 'Far be it from us that we should abandon the Lord and serve foreign gods!'
Joshua 24:17 For the Lord our God is He who brought us and our ancestors out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. He performed great signs before our eyes and protected us on every road by which we traveled and among all the peoples through whom we passed.
Joshua 24:18 And He drove out all the nations, including the Amorites, the inhabitants of the land into which we entered. Therefore, we also will serve the Lord, because He Himself is our God.
Joshua 24:19 Then Joshua said to the people: 'You will not be able to serve the Lord, for He is a holy God, and a strong, jealous God. He will not forgive your wicked deeds and your sins.'
Joshua 24:20 If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, He will turn against you and afflict you. He will utterly destroy you, after He has done so much good for you.
Joshua 24:21 But the people said to Joshua: 'By no means! We will indeed serve the Lord!'
Joshua 24:22 And Joshua said to the people: 'You yourselves are witnesses that you have chosen the Lord for yourselves, to serve Him.' And they responded: 'We are witnesses!'
Joshua 24:23 Now, therefore, he said, 'Remove the foreign gods that are among you, and turn your hearts towards the Lord, the God of Israel.'
Joshua 24:24 And the people said to Joshua: 'We will serve the Lord our God, and we will obey His voice.'
Joshua 24:25 So on that day, Joshua made a covenant with the people and established for them statutes and ordinances in Shechem.
Joshua 24:26 And he wrote all these words in the book of the Law of the Lord. He also took a large stone and set it up there under the oak tree that was in the sanctuary of the Lord.
Joshua 24:27 And he said to all the people: 'Behold, this very stone will be a witness against you. For it has heard all the words of the Lord which He has spoken to you. Therefore, do not deny Him afterwards and lie to the Lord your God.'
Joshua 24:28 Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.
Joshua 24:29 After these events, Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being one hundred and ten years old.
Joshua 24:30 And they buried him within the boundaries of his own inherited land in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.
Joshua 24:31 And Israel served the Lord throughout all the days of Joshua, and during the days of the elders who lived for a long time after Joshua, and who had known all the works of the Lord that He had done for Israel.
Joshua 24:32 Also, the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up from Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of land that Jacob had purchased from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver. And it became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph.
Joshua 24:33 Eleazar, the son of Aaron, also died. And they buried him in Gibeah of Phinehas, his son, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.
Judges 1:1 After the death of Joshua, the sons of Israel consulted the Lord, asking: 'Who among us will go up first against the Canaanites, and be the leader of the war?'
Judges 1:2 And the Lord said: 'Judah will go up; behold, I have given the land into his power.'
Judges 1:3 And Judah said to Simeon, his brother: 'Come with me into my allotted territory, and fight against the Canaanites, so that I also may go with you into your allotted territory and help you.' And Simeon went with him.
Judges 1:4 So Judah went up, and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their power. And they struck down ten thousand men in Bezek.
Judges 1:5 And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him, and struck down the Canaanites and the Perizzites who were with him.
Judges 1:6 But Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and captured him. They then cut off the tips of his hands and his feet.
Judges 1:7 And Adoni-Bezek said: 'Seventy kings, with the tips of their hands and feet cut off, gathered the scraps of food under my table. As I have done to them, so God has now repaid me.' Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
Judges 1:8 The sons of Judah then attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They put to the sword all they found in it, and then burned the city walls with fire.
Judges 1:9 And after these things, they went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the mountainous region, and to the south, and in the lowlands.
Judges 1:10 Judah then went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (which was anciently called Kirjath-Arba), and struck down Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
Judges 1:11 And from there he proceeded to the inhabitants of Debir, whose ancient name was Kirjath-Sepher, which means 'the city of books'.
Judges 1:12 And Caleb said: 'Whoever strikes down Kirjath-Sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah, my daughter, as his wife.'
Judges 1:13 And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it. So Caleb gave him Achsah, his daughter, as his wife.
Judges 1:14 As she went with Othniel, she urged her husband to ask her father for a field. She then dismounted from her donkey with a sigh of desire. And Caleb asked her: 'What do you want?'
Judges 1:15 And she replied: 'Give me a special gift. You have given me dry land; now also grant me springs of water.' So Caleb gave her the upper spring and the lower spring.
Judges 1:16 Now the children of the Kenite, Moses' relative by marriage, went up from the City of Palms (Jericho) with the sons of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah, which is to the south of Arad, and they lived there with them.
Judges 1:17 Then Judah went with Simeon, his brother, and they struck down the Canaanites who lived in Zephath, and utterly destroyed them. So the name of the city was called Hormah.
Judges 1:18 Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.
Judges 1:19 And the Lord was with Judah, and they drove out the inhabitants of the mountainous region. But they could not drive out the inhabitants of the valleys, because those had many iron chariots with scythes.
Judges 1:20 And they gave Hebron to Caleb, just as Moses had said, and from there he drove out the three sons of Anak.
Judges 1:21 But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem until the present day.
Judges 1:22 The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.
Judges 1:23 For when they were besieging the city that was called Luzah (whose name in ancient times was Bethel),
Judges 1:24 they saw a man coming out of the city, and they urged him, saying: 'Show us the entrance to the city, and we will show you mercy.'
Judges 1:25 And when he showed them, they struck down the city with the edge of the sword. But they let that man and all his relatives go free.
Judges 1:26 That man then went to the land of the Hittites and built a city there, and called its name Luzah. That is its name to this present day.
Judges 1:27 Manasseh also did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shean and Taanach with their surrounding villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo with their surrounding villages. So the Canaanites began to live among them.
Judges 1:28 But after Israel became strong, they made the Canaanites subject to tribute, and were unwilling to drive them out completely.
Judges 1:29 Ephraim also did not kill the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived among them in Gezer.
Judges 1:30 Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron and Nahalol. Instead, the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to tribute.
Judges 1:31 Asher also did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor of Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.
Judges 1:32 So they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, and did not subdue them.
Judges 1:33 Naphtali also did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and Beth-Anath. So they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, and the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and Beth-Anath became subject to tribute to them.
Judges 1:34 And the Amorites confined the sons of Dan to the mountainous region and did not allow them to come down to the plains.
Judges 1:35 And the Amorites lived in Mount Heres (which means 'clay-mountain' or 'sun-mountain'), in Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But the power of the house of Joseph was strong enough, so they became subject to tribute to them.
Judges 1:36 Now the territory of the Amorites extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim (Scorpion Pass), from Sela (Petra), and the higher places above it.
Judges 1:1 After Joshua died, the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying: "Who among us should go up first against the Canaanites, and lead us in this war?"
Judges 1:2 And the Lord replied: "The tribe of Judah will go up first. Understand this: I have already given this land into their power."
Judges 1:3 So the tribe of Judah said to the tribe of Simeon, their kinsman: "Come with me into the territory that was allotted to my tribe, and let us fight against the Canaanites there. In return, I will also go with you into the territory allotted to your tribe." And the tribe of Simeon went with them.
Judges 1:4 So the tribe of Judah went into battle, and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their power. They struck down ten thousand men at a place called Bezek.
Judges 1:5 They found the king of Bezek, Adonibezek, in the city of Bezek and fought against him, striking down the Canaanites and Perizzites.
Judges 1:6 Adonibezek fled, but they pursued and captured him. Then they cut off the thumbs of his hands and the great toes of his feet.
Judges 1:7 Adonibezek then said: "Seventy kings, whom I had mutilated by cutting off their thumbs and great toes, used to gather the scraps from under my table. As I have done to them, so God has now done to me." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
Judges 1:8 After this, the sons of Judah attacked Jerusalem. They captured it, put everyone they found in it to the sword, and burned the entire city with fire.
Judges 1:9 After taking Jerusalem, they went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the mountainous regions, the southern lands, and the plains.
Judges 1:10 The tribe of Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron. (Hebron was formerly called Kirjath-Arba, meaning 'the city of Arba, the father of the giants.') There, they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai—three of the Anakim, who were giants.
Judges 1:11 From there, they went against the inhabitants of Debir, whose old name was Kirjath-Sepher, which means "the city of books" or "the city of letters."
Judges 1:12 Then Caleb said: "Whoever attacks Kirjath-Sepher and captures it, to that man I will give Achsah, my daughter, to be his wife."
Judges 1:13 And so Othniel, the son of Kenaz (who was Caleb's younger brother, and thus Othniel's uncle), attacked and captured it. In fulfillment of his promise, Caleb gave him Achsah, his daughter, as his wife.
Judges 1:14 As she was being led away to her husband, Achsah urged Othniel to ask her father for a field. Then, as she sat on her donkey, she sighed, perhaps in expectation or anxiety. Caleb asked her, "What is it you want?"
Judges 1:15 But she replied: "Please give me a special gift, a blessing for my inheritance. You have given me land in the arid south. Now, please add also some watered land." So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs of water.
Judges 1:16 Now, the descendants of the Kenite, who were relatives of Moses (from his father-in-law Jethro's lineage), had gone up from Jericho, "the City of Palm Trees." They went with the sons of Judah into the desert region, south of Arad, and settled there among them.
Judges 1:17 So the tribe of Judah then went with the tribe of Simeon, their kinsman, and they struck down the Canaanites who lived in Zephath. They utterly destroyed the city and its inhabitants, and the city was then called Hormah, meaning "destruction."
Judges 1:18 The tribe of Judah passed through Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, as well as their surrounding territories. (This implies they didn't fully conquer and hold these Philistine strongholds).
Judges 1:19 The Lord was with the tribe of Judah, and they conquered the inhabitants of the mountainous regions. However, they were unable to drive out the inhabitants of the valleys, because those people were equipped with chariots made of iron.
Judges 1:20 They gave Hebron to Caleb, just as Moses had promised, and Caleb successfully drove out from there the three sons of Anak.
Judges 1:21 However, the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusite inhabitants of Jerusalem. So, the Jebusites continued to live alongside the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem, right up to the time this account was written.
Judges 1:22 The tribes descended from Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) also went up to attack Bethel, and the Lord was with them.
Judges 1:23 They sent spies to reconnoiter the city, which had previously been called Luz.
Judges 1:24 The spies saw a man leaving the city and said to him: "Show us how to enter the city, and we will show you mercy."
Judges 1:25 When he showed them an entrance, they attacked the city and put all its inhabitants to the sword. But they allowed that man and his entire family to depart unharmed.
Judges 1:26 That man went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz. That has remained its name even to the present day.
Judges 1:27 But the tribe of Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, or Megiddo, nor the inhabitants of their surrounding villages. Instead, the Canaanites continued to live among them in those places.
Judges 1:28 When the people of Israel grew stronger, they indeed subjected the Canaanites to forced labor and tribute. However, they were unwilling to completely drive them out as God had commanded.
Judges 1:29 Likewise, the tribe of Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites continued to live alongside them in Gezer.
Judges 1:30 The tribe of Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or Nahalol. Instead, the Canaanites lived among them and became forced laborers.
Judges 1:31 The tribe of Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.
Judges 1:32 So the Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, failing to drive them out.
Judges 1:33 Naphtali also did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh or Beth-Anath. Instead, they lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and the people of Beth-Shemesh and Beth-Anath became their forced laborers.
Judges 1:34 The Amorites, however, confined the sons of Dan to the mountainous regions, not allowing them to come down into the plains.
Judges 1:35 The Amorites remained in Mount Heres (which means "Mount of Pottery"), in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. However, the influence and power of the House of Joseph eventually grew stronger, and they forced these Amorites to become their tribute-paying laborers.
Judges 1:36 The boundary of the Amorites extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim, continuing through Sela and beyond. (This indicates the southern extent of their power or where the Israelites contained them).
Judges 2:1 And the Angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to the place of weeping, and He said: 'I led you out of Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. And I promised that I would never break My covenant with you, for all time;'
Judges 2:2 'provided only that you would not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land, but instead, you were to tear down their altars. Yet you refused to obey My voice. Why did you do this?'
Judges 2:3 Therefore, I also refused to drive them out from before you. Instead, they will be a snare to you, and their gods will become a stumbling block for you.'
Judges 2:4 And when the Angel of the Lord spoke all these words to all the sons of Israel, they raised their voices and wept aloud.
Judges 2:5 And they called the name of that place 'The Place of Weepers', and there they offered sacrifices to the Lord.
Judges 2:6 Therefore, Joshua dismissed the sons of Israel, and each man went to his own allotted land to take possession of it.
Judges 2:7 And the people served the Lord all the days that Joshua lived, and all the days of the elders who continued to live long after Joshua, and who had seen all the powerful works that the Lord had done for Israel.
Judges 2:8 But Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died when he was one hundred and ten years old.
Judges 2:9 And they buried him within the borders of his allotted territory, in Timnath-Serah, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.
Judges 2:10 And all that generation was gathered to their fathers through death. Then another people arose after them, who did not know the Lord, nor the powerful works that He had done for Israel.
Judges 2:11 And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they began to serve the Baals.
Judges 2:12 And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had led them out of the land of Egypt. They followed after foreign gods, choosing from among the gods of the peoples who lived around them, and they worshipped these false gods. In doing so, they provoked the Lord to anger.
Judges 2:13 And they abandoned the Lord and served Baal and the Astartes.
Judges 2:14 And the Lord, being angry with Israel, handed them over to plunderers, who stole from them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies who lived around them, and they were no longer able to resist their adversaries.
Judges 2:15 But wherever they wanted to go, the hand of the Lord turned against them, just as He had spoken and sworn to them. And they were greatly afflicted and suffered severely.
Judges 2:16 Then the Lord raised up judges, who delivered them from the hands of their devastators.
Judges 2:17 But they refused to listen even to the judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with foreign gods and worshipped them. They quickly abandoned the way that their fathers had walked, and though they heard the commands of the Lord, they did everything contrary to them.
Judges 2:18 And when the Lord raised up judges, during the days of these judges, the Lord was moved to pity because of the groans of those who were oppressed and afflicted by their tormentors.
Judges 2:19 But after the death of a judge, they again returned to their evil ways and did things much worse than their fathers had done, following foreign gods, serving them, and worshipping them. They did not abandon their corrupt practices, nor the stubborn path in which they had grown accustomed to walk.
Judges 2:20 And the wrath of the Lord burned against Israel, and He said: 'Because this nation has transgressed My covenant, which I commanded their fathers, and they refused to obey My voice;'
Judges 2:21 'I also will no longer drive out from before them any of the nations that Joshua left remaining, not having caused them to perish completely;'
Judges 2:22 'so that through them I may test Israel, to see whether they will keep the way of the Lord and walk in it, as their fathers did, or not.'
Judges 2:23 Therefore, the Lord allowed all these nations to remain. He did not immediately drive them out, nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.
Judges 2:1 And the Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to 'The Place of Weeping', and He declared: "I brought you out of Egypt and led you into the land which I swore to your fathers, and I promised that I would never make My covenant with you void forever:"
Judges 2:2 "However, you were not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of this land, but you were to tear down their altars. Yet you refused to listen to My voice. Why have you done this?"
Judges 2:3 "Therefore, I also decided not to drive them out from before you, so that they would be a snare to you, and their gods would be a stumbling block to you."
Judges 2:4 And when the Angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, they raised their voices and wept aloud.
Judges 2:5 And the name of that place was called 'The Place of Weeping', and they offered sacrifices there to the Lord.
Judges 2:6 So Joshua sent the people away, and each went to his own inheritance to take possession of it.
Judges 2:7 And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who lived for a long time after him, who had known all the works of the Lord that He had done for Israel.
Judges 2:8 Now Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died when he was one hundred and ten years old.
Judges 2:9 And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, in Timnath-serah, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
Judges 2:10 And all that generation was gathered to their fathers—meaning they died off—and another people arose who did not know the Lord, nor the works that He had done for Israel.
Judges 2:11 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they served the Baals—false gods.
Judges 2:12 And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had led them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who lived around them, and they worshipped them. And they provoked the Lord to anger.
Judges 2:13 They forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Astarte.
Judges 2:14 So the Lord became angry with Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them. He also delivered them into the hands of all their surrounding enemies, so that they could not stand against their adversaries.
Judges 2:15 Wherever they wanted to go, the hand of the Lord was against them to their detriment, just as He had spoken and sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.
Judges 2:16 Nevertheless, the Lord raised up judges, who delivered them from the hands of those who devastated them.
Judges 2:17 But they would not listen to these judges either; instead, they committed spiritual fornication with other gods and worshipped them. They quickly turned away from the path their fathers had walked, who had listened to the commandments of the Lord; they did everything contrary.
Judges 2:18 And whenever the Lord raised up judges, in those days the Lord would relent and be moved to pity because of their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them. For He would not permit them to be tormented further.
Judges 2:19 But after the judge died, they would turn back and act even worse than their fathers had done, following other gods, serving them, and worshipping them. They would not abandon their evil practices, nor the stubborn way they had accustomed themselves to walk.
Judges 2:20 So the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel, and He said: "Because this people has made My covenant void, which I commanded their fathers, and they have refused to listen to My voice,"
Judges 2:21 "I also will no longer drive out from before them any of the nations that Joshua had left behind when he died,"
Judges 2:22 "so that through them I may test Israel, to see whether they will keep the way of the Lord and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not."
Judges 2:23 Therefore, the Lord allowed all these nations to remain, and He did not quickly drive them out, nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.
Judges 3:1 These are the nations that the Lord God allowed to remain in the land—specifically, so that through them He could train the Israelites, especially those who had not personally experienced the wars in Canaan.
Judges 3:2 God's purpose was that at least the future generations of the Israelites would learn and be taught how to fight effectively against their enemies.
Judges 3:3 These nations included: the five lords of the Philistines; all the Canaanites; the Sidonians; and the Hivites who lived in the region of Mount Lebanon, stretching from Mount Baal-hermon all the way to the entrance of Hamath.
Judges 3:4 And these nations were specifically left so that the Israelites would be tested through them. This would reveal whether they truly loved and obeyed the commandments of the Lord God, which He had given to their ancestors through Moses, or if they would disobey Him.
Judges 3:5 Therefore, the sons of Israel began to live among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Judges 3:6 They began to take the daughters of these foreign peoples as wives, and they gave their own daughters to the sons of these peoples, and then they began to serve the gods of these nations.
Judges 3:7 The sons of Israel committed evil in the sight of the Lord God. They forgot the Lord their God and began to serve the Baals and the Astartes—false gods and goddesses of the surrounding nations.
Judges 3:8 So, the Lord God's anger was kindled against Israel. He delivered them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Mesopotamia. The Israelites served this king for eight years.
Judges 3:9 Then the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord God for help. The Lord God raised up a deliverer for them who saved them—specifically, Othniel, the son of Kenaz, who was the younger brother of Caleb.
Judges 3:10 The Spirit of the Lord God came upon Othniel, and he judged and led Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord God delivered Cushan-Rishathaim, the king of Syria, into his hand. Othniel then utterly prevailed over him.
Judges 3:11 After this victory, the land had peace for forty years. Then Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.
Judges 3:12 But again, the sons of Israel continued to commit evil in the sight of the Lord God. Because they sinned against Him, the Lord God strengthened Eglon, the king of Moab, to be their enemy.
Judges 3:13 Eglon gathered the sons of Ammon and Amalek to join him. He went and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms—Jericho.
Judges 3:14 So the sons of Israel served Eglon, the king of Moab, for eighteen years.
Judges 3:15 And afterward, they cried out to the Lord God for help. The Lord God raised up a deliverer for them named Ehud, the son of Gera, from the tribe of Benjamin. Ehud was a left-handed man, using both hands as if they were his right. The sons of Israel sent gifts to Eglon, the king of Moab, through Ehud.
Judges 3:16 Ehud had made for himself a double-edged sword, about a cubit (a Roman palm, or 7-9 inches) in length, with the hilt in the middle. He fastened it under his clothing on his right thigh—making it unusual for a right-handed guard to search for it there.
Judges 3:17 Ehud presented the gifts to Eglon, the king of Moab. Now, King Eglon was an exceedingly fat man.
Judges 3:18 After Ehud had finished presenting the gifts, he sent away the companions who had come with him.
Judges 3:19 Ehud himself returned from Gilgal, where the idols were, and he said to the king, “I have a secret message for you, O King.” The king responded, “Silence!” And all who were around him then left the room.
Judges 3:20 So Ehud went in to him. The king was sitting alone in his cool, summer upper room. Ehud then said, “I have a message from God for you.” Immediately, the king stood up from his throne.
Judges 3:21 Then Ehud extended his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into the king's belly with such force,
Judges 3:22 that the hilt followed the blade into the wound, and the fat closed around the blade. Ehud did not pull the sword out; he left it completely embedded there. Immediately, the contents of the king's bowels came out through the wound.
Judges 3:23 Ehud then went out through the porch, having closed and locked the doors of the upper room behind him.
Judges 3:24 After he had left, the king's servants came in. Seeing the doors of the upper room closed, they said, “He is probably relieving himself in the cool, summer room.”
Judges 3:25 They waited for a long time until they became embarrassed. When they saw that no one was opening the doors, they took a key, opened the doors, and found their lord lying on the floor, dead.
Judges 3:26 But while they were waiting, Ehud escaped. He passed by the idols in the place where they were, evading capture, and came to Seirath.
Judges 3:27 Immediately upon his arrival, he blew a trumpet in the mountains of Ephraim. The sons of Israel descended with him, with Ehud leading the way.
Judges 3:28 He said to them, “Follow me, for the Lord God has delivered our enemies, the Moabites, into our hands!” So they went down with him and seized the fords of the Jordan River that led toward Moab, preventing anyone from crossing over.
Judges 3:29 At that time, they struck down about ten thousand Moabite men, all strong and valiant warriors; not one of them could escape.
Judges 3:30 So Moab was humbled on that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had peace for eighty years.
Judges 3:31 After Ehud, there was Shamgar, the son of Anath. He struck down six hundred Philistine men with an ox-goad—a long stick with a sharp point used to drive oxen. He also delivered Israel.
Judges 3:32 But the sons of Israel again committed evil in the sight of the Lord God. So the Lord God abandoned them into the hand of Jabin, the king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-Ha-goiim—meaning, 'Harosheth of the Gentiles' or 'Nations'.
Judges 3:33 The sons of Israel cried out to the Lord God, because Jabin had cruelly oppressed them for twenty years. He possessed nine hundred iron chariots, and he had severely afflicted the Israelites.
Judges 3:34 Now, Deborah, a prophetess and the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
Judges 3:35 She used to sit under a palm tree, which was named after her, located between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. The sons of Israel would come up to her for every legal judgment and dispute.
Judges 3:36 Deborah sent and called for Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Kedesh-Naphtali. She said to him, “The Lord God of Israel has commanded you: Go, lead an army to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and the sons of Zebulun.
Judges 3:37 I will bring Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and all his multitude, to you at the Kishon River. And I will deliver them into your hand.”
Judges 3:38 Barak said to her, “If you come with me, I will go; but if you refuse to come with me, I will not go.”
Judges 3:39 She said to him, “I will certainly go with you. However, the victory will not be to your honor, for Sisera will be delivered into the hand of a woman.” So Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Judges 3:40 And Barak gathered Naphtali and Zebulun in Kedesh. He went up with ten thousand fighting men, having Deborah with him as his companion.
Judges 4:1 After Ehud, the son of Jemini, died, the sons of Israel again offended the Lord through their evil actions.
Judges 4:2 The Lord then allowed Jabin, king of Canaan, to conquer them. Jabin ruled from Hazor. His army's commander was Sisara, who lived in Haroseth Goim.
Judges 4:3 The sons of Israel cried out to the Lord for help, because King Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots and had severely oppressed them for twenty years.
Judges 4:4 Now, during that time, a prophetess named Deborah, wife of Lapidoth, was leading the people of Israel as their judge.
Judges 4:5 She sat under a palm tree that was named after her, located between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. The sons of Israel would come up to her for every legal case and dispute.
Judges 4:6 She sent a message, summoning Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kedesh-naphtali. She told him: "The Lord, the God of Israel, has given a command: 'Go and lead an army up to Mount Tabor. Take with you ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun.'"
Judges 4:7 "I will draw Sisara, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and all his forces, to the Kishon Stream, to meet you there. I will then deliver them into your hands."
Judges 4:8 Barak replied to her: "If you come with me, I will go. But if you are unwilling to come with me, then I will not go."
Judges 4:9 She answered him: "I will certainly go with you. But on this mission, the glory of victory will not be yours, because Sisara will be delivered into the hand of a woman." So Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Judges 4:10 Barak then called together the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali, and he marched up with ten thousand fighters, taking Deborah with him.
Judges 4:11 Now Heber the Kenite had previously separated from the other Kenites, his brothers, who were descendants of Hobab, Moses' father-in-law. Heber had pitched his tents near the valley called Sennim, which was close to Kedesh.
Judges 4:12 It was reported to Sisara that Barak, son of Abinoam, had ascended Mount Tabor.
Judges 4:13 Immediately, Sisara gathered all his nine hundred iron chariots and his entire army from Haroseth Goim, and led them to the Kishon Stream.
Judges 4:14 Deborah then said to Barak: "Arise! This is the day in which the Lord has given Sisara into your hand. Behold, the Lord is going before you!" So Barak descended from Mount Tabor with his ten thousand men.
Judges 4:15 And the Lord threw Sisara, all his chariots, and his entire multitude into a panic before Barak's sword. The rout was so complete that Sisara leaped down from his chariot and fled on foot.
Judges 4:16 Barak pursued the fleeing chariots and the army all the way to Haroseth Goim. And the entire host of the enemy fell by the sword, until they were utterly destroyed.
Judges 4:17 Sisara, however, fleeing on foot, arrived at the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. This was because there was a peace treaty between Jabin, king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.
Judges 4:18 Jael then came out to meet Sisara and said to him: "Come in, my lord, come in to me, do not be afraid." When he had entered her tent, she covered him with a rug.
Judges 4:19 Sisara said to her: "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him again.
Judges 4:20 Sisara then told her: "Stand at the entrance of the tent. If anyone comes asking you, saying: 'Is there anyone here?' you are to answer: 'There is no one.'"
Judges 4:21 So Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg, and taking a hammer, she quietly and cautiously went in. She placed the tent peg against his temple, and then struck the hammer forcefully, driving the peg into his brain as he slept soundly. In this way, he died.
Judges 4:22 And behold, Barak was coming, pursuing Sisara. Jael came out to meet him and said to him: "Come, and I will show you the man you are looking for." When he entered her tent, he saw Sisara lying dead, with the tent peg driven into his temple.
Judges 4:23 So on that day, God brought low Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the sons of Israel.
Judges 4:24 And the sons of Israel continued to advance, growing stronger day by day in their resistance against Jabin, king of Canaan, until they completely destroyed him.
Judges 4:1 After Ehud, their deliverer, had died, the people of Israel again committed sins before the Lord God.
Judges 4:2 So the Lord God handed them over to the power of Jabin, the king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. This king possessed nine hundred iron chariots, a formidable military force. He tyrannically oppressed the people of Israel for twenty years.
Judges 4:3 The people of Israel then cried out to the Lord God, because this king had oppressed them most cruelly for those twenty years, especially with his nine hundred iron chariots providing him such military dominance.
Judges 4:4 At that time, Deborah, a prophetess and the wife of Lapidoth, was exercising leadership over the people of Israel.
Judges 4:5 She sat under a palm tree, which was known by her name, located between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim. The people of Israel would come to her there for every legal judgment and to receive her wisdom.
Judges 4:6 Deborah sent for and summoned Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Kedesh-Naphtali. She said to him, 'The Lord God of Israel commands you: Go and lead an army to Mount Tabor, taking with you ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun.'
Judges 4:7 'And I, the Lord God, will draw Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, along with his chariots and all his forces, to meet you at the Kishon River. Then I will deliver them into your hand, granting you victory.'
Judges 4:8 Barak replied to her, 'If you go with me, I will go to battle. But if you refuse to come, I will not proceed.'
Judges 4:9 Deborah said to him, 'I will certainly go with you. However, the glory of this victory will not be yours, because Sisera will be delivered into the hand of a woman instead.' So Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Judges 4:10 Barak then sent for the men of Zebulun and Naphtali, and he marched up with ten thousand men, with Deborah personally leading them.
Judges 4:11 Now Heber the Kenite, whose people were descendants of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses and traditionally allies of Israel, had separated himself from the other Kenites, his brethren. He had pitched his tents in the valley called Zaanaim, which was near Kedesh.
Judges 4:12 It was reported to Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, had gone up with his forces to Mount Tabor.
Judges 4:13 So Sisera gathered all his nine hundred iron chariots and his entire army from Harosheth, a city of the Gentiles. He led them to the Kishon River.
Judges 4:14 Then Deborah said to Barak, 'Arise! For this is the very day on which the Lord God has delivered Sisera into your hand. Behold, the Lord God Himself goes before you in battle!' So Barak descended from Mount Tabor, and his ten thousand men with him.
Judges 4:15 And the Lord God struck terror into Sisera, his entire chariot force, and his whole army, causing them to be defeated by the edge of Barak's sword. Sisera himself, in desperation, leaped down from his chariot and fled on foot.
Judges 4:16 Barak pursued the fleeing chariots and the army all the way to Harosheth, the city of the Gentiles. The entire multitude of the enemy was slain; not a single one was left alive.
Judges 4:17 Sisera, still fleeing, arrived at the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. He sought refuge there because there was a treaty of peace between Jabin, the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite, making it seemingly a safe haven.
Judges 4:18 So Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, 'Come in, my lord, do not be afraid.' When he entered her tent, she covered him with a rug for concealment and comfort.
Judges 4:19 He said to her, 'Please give me a little water, for I am very thirsty.' But she opened a skin of milk and gave him to drink, a gesture of great hospitality. After he drank, she covered him again.
Judges 4:20 Then Sisera instructed her, 'Stand at the entrance of the tent. If anyone comes asking you, saying, 'Is anyone here?' you must answer, 'No one is here.'
Judges 4:21 But Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg and a hammer. She quietly and cautiously approached Sisera, who was deeply overcome by sleep and exhaustion, and placed the tent peg against his temple. She then drove the peg through his head and into the ground with the hammer, and so he died.
Judges 4:22 Just then, Barak arrived, pursuing Sisera. Jael went out to meet him and said, 'Come, and I will show you the man you are seeking.' So he went into her tent and saw Sisera lying dead, with the tent peg driven into his temple.
Judges 4:23 Thus, on that day, God thoroughly humbled Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the people of Israel, demonstrating His power and faithfulness.
Judges 4:24 And the people of Israel, after this decisive victory, continued to press more and more upon Jabin, the king of Canaan, until he and his kingdom were utterly destroyed.
Judges 5:1 And so, on that day, Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, sang this song, saying:
Judges 5:2 For the people of Israel willingly offered themselves for battle—those who did not fear to fight—for this, praise the Lord!
Judges 5:3 Hear this, O kings! And pay attention, O princes! I will sing to the Lord! I myself will sing praises, making melody to the Lord, the God of Israel!
Judges 5:4 Lord, when You marched forth from Seir, when You advanced from the lands of Edom, the earth shook, and the skies poured down their water.
Judges 5:5 The mountains melted away at the presence of the Lord, even Sinai itself trembled at the presence of the Lord, the God of Israel.
Judges 5:6 In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, and in the days of Jael, the main roads were deserted. Those who used to travel on them now walked through winding, secluded paths.
Judges 5:7 The strong men—the leaders—in Israel ceased to lead; they rested, until Deborah arose, until a mother arose in Israel to guide them.
Judges 5:8 The Lord chose new wars and personally overturned the gates of the enemies. Not a shield or a spear was seen among the forty thousand warriors of Israel.
Judges 5:9 My heart loves the leaders of Israel, who willingly risked themselves. Bless the Lord!
Judges 5:10 You who ride on shining donkeys, you who sit in judgment, and you who travel along the roads—speak of these events!
Judges 5:11 Where the water-drawers sing loudly, there let them recount the righteous acts of the Lord and His strength in Israel. Then the Lord's people went down to the city gates, prepared for battle.
Judges 5:12 Arise, arise, Deborah! Arise, arise, and sing your song! Arise, Barak, and capture your captives, O son of Abinoam!
Judges 5:13 Then the remnant of the people turned to the Lord. The mighty leader came down to me; the Lord’s people stood among the strong.
Judges 5:14 From Ephraim, their root, came those against Amalek; and after you, Benjamin, among your people. From Machir came down leaders, and from Zebulun came those who began to lead the army.
Judges 5:15 The commanders of Issachar were with Deborah and Barak. How the strongest warrior was scattered, his feet ran headlong into the valley! Among the clans of Reuben, great divisions and arguments were found.
Judges 5:16 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, listening to the whistling of the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben, great divisions and arguments were found.
Judges 5:17 Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. Dan remained by his ships. Asher dwelt by the seashore and remained in his harbors.
Judges 5:18 But Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives even unto death, on the high ground of Merom.
Judges 5:19 The kings came, and they fought. The kings of Canaan fought in Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, but they carried off no plunder.
Judges 5:20 From the sky, they were fought against! The stars themselves, remaining in their order and course, fought against Sisera.
Judges 5:21 The torrent of Kishon swept away their bodies—the torrent of Cadumim, the torrent of Kishon! My soul, trample down the mighty!
Judges 5:22 The hooves of the horses beat rapidly, as the strongest warriors fled in a frenzy.
Judges 5:23 “Curse Meroz,” said the Angel of the Lord. “Curse its inhabitants, because they did not come to the aid of the Lord, to the aid of His strong warriors!”
Judges 5:24 May Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be blessed above all women, and may she be blessed within her tent.
Judges 5:25 He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a noble bowl, she offered him curdled milk.
Judges 5:26 She reached out her left hand for a tent peg, and her right hand for a workman’s hammer. She struck Sisera, finding a vulnerable spot on his head, and pierced his temples.
Judges 5:27 Between her feet, he sank down, he collapsed, and he died. Between her feet, he lay, and he perished.
Judges 5:28 Through the window, Sisera's mother looked out, and wailed, lamenting through her tears: “Why is his chariot so slow to return? Why have the wheels of his chariots delayed?”
Judges 5:29 One of her wise noblewomen answered her, and she herself repeated these words to the other women:
Judges 5:30 “Perhaps he is now dividing the spoils! Sisera is taking as plunder the most beautiful and varied garments, and necklaces and richly colored jewels are being placed around his neck.”
Judges 5:31 May all Your enemies perish in this way, O Lord! But may those who love You shine like the sun when it rises in its full glory. And the land had rest for forty years.
Judges 5:1 On that day, Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoem, sang this song, saying:
Judges 5:2 You, the people, offered yourselves willingly to fight. For this, bless the Lord.
Judges 5:3 Listen, you kings! Pay attention, you rulers! It is I, I myself, who will sing to the Lord; I will make music for the Lord, the God of Israel.
Judges 5:4 Lord, when you came forth from Seir, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth shook violently. The skies also dripped, and the clouds poured down water.
Judges 5:5 The mountains flowed, trembling before the face of the Lord. Mount Sinai itself trembled before the face of the Lord, the God of Israel.
Judges 5:6 In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath, and in the days of Jael, the main roads were deserted. Those who used to travel on them instead walked on winding, hidden paths, avoiding the public routes.
Judges 5:7 The brave warriors in Israel had ceased fighting; they had rested, until Deborah rose up. She rose as a mother figure to guide Israel.
Judges 5:8 When new wars came, the Lord chose to fight. He Himself overthrew the gates of the enemies. But among the forty thousand warriors of Israel, no shield or spear was seen in their hands; they were unarmed.
Judges 5:9 My heart loves the leaders of Israel, the ones who willingly put themselves in danger. For this, bless the Lord.
Judges 5:10 You who ride on shining donkeys, you who sit in judgment, and you who travel on the roads, speak of these events.
Judges 5:11 There, where they gathered to declare the righteous acts of the Lord and the just deeds of His mighty warriors in Israel, the people of the Lord then went down to the city gates and fought the enemy.
Judges 5:12 Arise, arise, Deborah! Arise, arise, and speak the song of victory! Arise, Barak, and take your captives, O son of Abinoem!
Judges 5:13 Then the remnant of the people of the Lord came down with the mighty ones. The Lord gave me leaders over the powerful people.
Judges 5:14 From Ephraim, they marched against the Amalekites. After you, O Benjamin, came against your own peoples, O Amalek. From Machir, leaders descended to join the fight, and from Zebulun came those who led the army.
Judges 5:15 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah and Barak. The men of Issachar followed in the footsteps of Deborah and Barak, directing their forces into the valley. But among the divisions of Reuben, there were great hesitations of heart.
Judges 5:16 Why did you sit among the two sheepfolds, listening to the whistles of the flocks, Reuben? Among the divisions of Reuben, there were great internal questionings and indecisions of heart.
Judges 5:17 Gilead stayed across the Jordan River and remained there. Why did Dan linger by his ships? Asher settled on the seashore and remained in his harbors, not joining the battle.
Judges 5:18 But Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives, offering themselves to death, in the region of Merom.
Judges 5:19 The kings came and fought. The kings of Canaan fought at Taanach, near the waters of Megiddo. But they took no plunder of silver; they gained nothing from their looting.
Judges 5:20 From the sky, the battle was waged against them. The stars, remaining in their fixed order and moving in their courses, fought against Sisara.
Judges 5:21 The Kishon River swept away their dead bodies; that ancient river, the Kishon River. My soul, trample down the mighty warriors!
Judges 5:22 The hooves of the horses pounded furiously, as the mightiest warriors fled in a frenzy.
Judges 5:23 “Curse Meroz!” said the Angel of the Lord. “Curse its inhabitants, because they did not come to the aid of the Lord, to help Him alongside the mightiest warriors.”
Judges 5:24 May Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be blessed above all women. May she be blessed within her tent, in her home.
Judges 5:25 He asked for water, but she gave him milk. In a bowl fit for a prince, she offered him curdled milk or butter, a thick, rich drink.
Judges 5:26 She reached out her left hand for a tent peg, and her right hand for a workman's hammer. She struck Sisara, seeking to inflict a wound to his head, and pierced through his temples.
Judges 5:27 Between her feet he sank down, he faltered, and then he died. Between her feet he collapsed, and there he lay lifeless.
Judges 5:28 Through the window, Sisara's mother looked out and cried loudly. From the rooftop, she spoke, saying: “Why is his chariot so long in returning? Why have the hoofbeats of his chariots been delayed?”
Judges 5:29 One of her wisest wives answered her, and she too spoke to her mother's words, providing an explanation:
Judges 5:30 “Perhaps he is now dividing the plunder. There will be the most beautiful of garments, and brightly embroidered cloths, to adorn the necks of the captives. For each man, there will be a single spoil to take home.”
Judges 5:31 May all your enemies perish in this way, O Lord! But may those who love you shine forth like the sun, going out in its full strength. And so, the land had peace for forty years.
Judges 6:1 But the sons of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and because of this, He delivered them into the power of Midian for seven years.
Judges 6:2 And they were severely oppressed by Midian. Because of this, the sons of Israel made for themselves caves in the mountains, hollows in the ground, and many fortified strongholds.
Judges 6:3 Whenever Israel had sown their crops, Midian and Amalek and the other peoples from the East would invade their land.
Judges 6:4 They would spread out and devastate the entire region, destroying everything as far as Gaza. They would leave nothing for the people of Israel to eat, neither sheep, oxen, nor donkeys.
Judges 6:5 For they themselves would come with their tents and their entire herds, and like swarms of locusts, they would fill up the land. The men and their camels were innumerable, and wherever they went, they devastated everything.
Judges 6:6 And so, Israel was brought very low and humbled before Midian. And the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord for help.
Judges 6:7 And when they had cried out to the Lord because of Midian,
Judges 6:8 the Lord sent a prophet to them, who spoke these words: "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'I made you ascend from the land of Egypt and led you out of that house of slavery.
Judges 6:9 I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all your enemies who afflicted you. I drove them out from before you and gave their land to you.
Judges 6:10 And I said: "I am the Lord your God. Do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are now living." But you would not listen to My voice.'"
Judges 6:11 Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under an oak tree that was in Ephra, which belonged to Joas, the father of the family of Ezri. And his son, Gideon, was threshing and cleaning wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.
Judges 6:12 The Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said: "The Lord is with you, O mighty warrior."
Judges 6:13 And Gideon said to Him: "Please, my Lord, if the Lord is with us, why have all these things happened to us? Where are all His miracles that our fathers told us about, saying: 'The Lord led us out of Egypt?' But now the Lord has abandoned us and delivered us into the power of Midian."
Judges 6:14 And the Lord looked at him and said: "Go in this strength of yours, and you will deliver Israel from the power of Midian. Know for certain that I Myself have sent you."
Judges 6:15 And Gideon, responding, said: "Please, my Lord, how shall I deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least significant in my father's house."
Judges 6:16 And the Lord said to him: "I will be with you. And you will strike down Midian as if they were only one man."
Judges 6:17 And Gideon said: "If I have found favor in your sight, give me a sign to prove that it is You who are speaking to me."
Judges 6:18 "Do not depart from here until I return to You and bring my offering and set it before You." And He replied: "I will wait for your return."
Judges 6:19 So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour, he made unleavened bread. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot. Then he brought it all out and offered it under the oak tree.
Judges 6:20 And the Angel of the Lord said to him: "Take the meat and the unleavened bread, and place them on that rock, and pour the broth over them." And when he had done so,
Judges 6:21 the Angel of the Lord stretched out the tip of the staff that He held in His hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Then fire came out from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread, and the Angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.
Judges 6:22 And when Gideon saw that it had been the Angel of the Lord, he said: "Alas, my Lord God! For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!"
Judges 6:23 And the Lord said to him: "Peace be with you. Do not fear; you will not die."
Judges 6:24 So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord, and he called it "The Lord is Peace" (Yahweh Shalom), even to this present day. This occurred while he was still in Ephra, which belonged to the family of Ezri.
Judges 6:25 That same night, the Lord said to him: "Take a bull from your father's herd, and another bull that is seven years old. Then tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the sacred grove of trees that is around it."
Judges 6:26 "And build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock, the very one upon which you made your offering earlier. Then, using the wood that you cut down from the sacred grove, offer a burnt offering."
Judges 6:27 So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did just as the Lord had commanded him. But because he was afraid of his father's household and the men of that city, he would not do it by day; instead, he completed everything during the night.
Judges 6:28 And when the men of his city rose early in the morning, they saw that the altar of Baal had been destroyed, the sacred grove cut down, and a bull offered as a sacrifice on the altar that had just been built.
Judges 6:29 And they said to one another: "Who did this?" And when they investigated to find the one responsible for the deed, it was said: "Gideon, the son of Joas, did all these things."
Judges 6:30 And they said to Joas: "Bring out your son here, so that he may die, because he destroyed the altar of Baal and cut down the sacred grove."
Judges 6:31 But Joas responded to them: "Are you going to avenge Baal and fight for him? Whoever opposes him, let him die before tomorrow's light arrives. If Baal is a god, let him avenge himself on the one who tore down his altar."
Judges 6:32 From that day forward, Gideon was called Jerobaal, which means "Baal Contends," because Joas had said: "Let Baal contend with him, because he tore down his altar."
Judges 6:33 Then all of Midian, and Amalek, and the peoples from the East gathered together. They crossed the Jordan River and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.
Judges 6:34 But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, strengthening him for battle. And Gideon blew the trumpet, summoning the house of Abiezer to follow him.
Judges 6:35 He also sent messengers throughout all of Manasseh, and they too followed him. And he sent others into Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came to meet him.
Judges 6:36 And Gideon said to the Lord: "If You truly intend to save Israel by my hand, as You have spoken,
Judges 6:37 behold, I will place a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and the ground all around it is dry, then I will know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken."
Judges 6:38 And it happened just so. For when Gideon rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung out enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.
Judges 6:39 And Gideon said again to the Lord: "Do not let your anger burn against me, Lord, if I try just one more time, seeking a sign with the fleece. I pray that only the fleece may be dry this time, and all the ground around it be wet with dew."
Judges 6:40 And God did so that night as he had requested. Only the fleece was dry, and all the ground around it was covered with dew.
Judges 6:1 The children of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. Therefore, the Lord gave them into the power of Midian for seven years.
Judges 6:2 The Midianites severely oppressed them, and they gained complete dominance over Israel.
Judges 6:3 Whenever Israel had planted their crops, Midian, Amalek, and the other Eastern peoples would invade.
Judges 6:4 They would establish their camps against Israel, and they would eat up everything that was sown in the land, all the way to Gaza. Nothing would be left in Israel for sustenance, neither for their livestock, nor sheep, nor cattle.
Judges 6:5 For all of them would come with their flocks and their tents, like a multitude of locusts. As they swarmed in, they would devastate everything.
Judges 6:6 So Israel was greatly humbled and brought low before Midian.
Judges 6:7 And Israel cried out to the Lord, pleading for help against the Midianites.
Judges 6:8 The Lord sent a prophet to them, who spoke these words: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I caused you to come up out of Egypt, and I led you out of the house of slavery.'
Judges 6:9 'I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all your enemies. I drove them out from before you, and I gave you their land.'
Judges 6:10 'And I said: I am the Lord your God. Do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live. But you have not obeyed my voice.'
Judges 6:11 Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under an oak tree which was in Ephra, and which belonged to Joas, of the family of Ezri. His son, Gideon, was threshing and cleaning wheat in a winepress, so that he could hide it from the Midianites.
Judges 6:12 The Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said: 'The Lord is with you, O mightiest of warriors!'
Judges 6:13 Gideon then said to him: 'Please, my Lord, if the Lord is with us, why has all this trouble come upon us? Where are all His wondrous works, which our fathers told us about, saying: "The Lord brought us out of Egypt"? But now the Lord has abandoned us and delivered us into the power of Midian.'
Judges 6:14 The Lord looked at him and said: 'Go in this strength of yours, and you shall deliver Israel from the power of Midian. Know for certain that I Myself have sent you.'
Judges 6:15 Gideon replied: 'Please, my Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the humblest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.'
Judges 6:16 The Lord then said to him: 'I will be with you. You shall strike down Midian as if they were a single man.'
Judges 6:17 Gideon said: 'If I have found favor in your sight, then give me a sign that it is truly you who speaks with me.'
Judges 6:18 'Do not leave here until I return to you, bringing my offering and presenting it to you.' The Angel replied: 'I will wait for your return.'
Judges 6:19 So Gideon went in and cooked a young goat, and from a measure of flour he made unleavened bread. He put the meat in a basket and poured the broth out into a pot separately. He brought it all out under the oak tree and offered it to the Angel.
Judges 6:20 The Angel of the Lord said to him: 'Take the meat and the unleavened bread and place them upon that rock, and pour the broth over them.' When Gideon had done so,
Judges 6:21 the Angel of the Lord extended the tip of the staff that He held in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire then rose from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of the Lord vanished from his sight.
Judges 6:22 When Gideon saw that it was indeed the Angel of the Lord, he cried out: 'Alas for me, O Lord God! For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!'
Judges 6:23 But the Lord said to him: 'Peace be with you. Do not be afraid. You shall not die.'
Judges 6:24 So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord, and he called it 'The Lord is Peace' (or 'Yahweh Shalom'). It stands even to this present day in Ephra, where the family of Ezri lives.
Judges 6:25 On that very night, the Lord said to Gideon: 'Take your father's bull, and another bull that is seven years old. Tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, and cut down the sacred grove that is around it.'
Judges 6:26 'Then build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock, upon which you previously placed your offering. Take the wood from the sacred grove that you have cut down, and offer a burnt offering.'
Judges 6:27 So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the Lord had commanded him. However, because he was afraid of his father's household and the men of that city, he did not want to do it by day. Instead, he made sure to complete everything by night.
Judges 6:28 When the men of the city rose early in the morning, they saw that the altar of Baal was torn down, the sacred grove was cut down, and the bull had been offered as a sacrifice on the altar that had just been built.
Judges 6:29 They said to one another: 'Who did this?' When they inquired diligently to find the one who had done it, it was told to them: 'Gideon, the son of Joas, did all these things.'
Judges 6:30 They then said to Joas: 'Bring out your son so that he may die! For he has torn down the altar of Baal and cut down the sacred grove!'
Judges 6:31 Joas answered those who were speaking against him: 'Will you fight for Baal? Will you contend on his behalf? Whoever stands up for him shall die before morning! If he is a god, let him contend for himself against the one who destroyed his altar!'
Judges 6:32 From that day on, Gideon was called Jerobaal (which means, 'Let Baal contend'), because Joas had said: 'Let Baal contend with him, since he tore down his altar.'
Judges 6:33 Then all of Midian, Amalek, and the peoples of the East gathered together. They crossed the Jordan River and camped in the valley of Jezrael.
Judges 6:34 But the Spirit of the Lord empowered Gideon. He sounded the trumpet, calling the household of Abiezer to follow him.
Judges 6:35 He also sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called to follow him. He sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came out to meet him.
Judges 6:36 Gideon then said to God: 'If you are truly going to save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,'
Judges 6:37 'I will place this fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and all the ground around it is dry, then I will know that you will deliver Israel by my hand, as you have spoken.'
Judges 6:38 And so it happened. When he rose early the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and found a bowl full of dew.
Judges 6:39 Gideon spoke to God again: 'Do not be angry with me, Lord, if I test you just one more time, seeking a sign with the fleece. Let only the fleece be dry, and let all the surrounding ground be wet with dew.'
Judges 6:40 And God did so that night as Gideon had requested. Only the fleece was dry, and there was dew on all the ground around it.
Judges 7:1 Jerubbaal, who was also called Gideon, and all the people with him rose during the night. They then set up their camp next to the Spring of Harad. The Midianite camp was located to the north of them, visible in the valley before them.
Judges 7:2 Then the Lord spoke to Gideon, saying: 'The people with you are too numerous. I will not hand Midian over to them, lest Israel boast against me and say: "I was delivered by my own strength."
Judges 7:3 Now, speak to the people and proclaim in everyone's hearing: 'Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return home.' So, twenty-two thousand men returned from Mount Galaad, and ten thousand remained.
Judges 7:4 And the Lord said to Gideon: 'There are still too many people. Lead them down to the waters, and there I will test them. Concerning whomever I tell you, "This one shall go with you," that one shall go. But whomever I forbid, that one shall return home.'
Judges 7:5 When he had led them down to the waters, the Lord said to Gideon: 'All who lap up the waters with their tongues, just as dogs lap, you shall separate them to one side. Likewise, do the same for every one who kneels to drink.'
Judges 7:6 So, the number of those who lapped from their hand to their mouth was three hundred men. However, all the rest of the multitude had knelt on their knees to drink.
Judges 7:7 And the Lord said to Gideon: 'With these three hundred men who lapped the waters, I will deliver you and give Midian into your hand. But all the rest of the multitude shall return to their homes.'
Judges 7:8 So, Gideon took the provisions and all the armor from the rest of the men. He then ordered all the other Israelites to return to their tents, while he himself, with the three hundred men, prepared for battle. The Midianite camp was below them in the valley.
Judges 7:9 That same night, the Lord said to him: 'Arise and go down into the camp, for I have delivered them into your hand.'
Judges 7:10 But if you are afraid to go down alone, then go down with Phara, your servant.
Judges 7:11 And when you hear what they are saying, then your hands will be strengthened, and you will go down to the battle more confidently. So, he himself and Phara, his servant, went down to the part of the camp where the armed scouts were stationed.
Judges 7:12 Now, the Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the peoples from the East were spread out in the valley, as numerous as a swarm of locusts. Their camels were also innumerable, like the sand that lies on the seashore.
Judges 7:13 When Gideon arrived, he heard someone telling a dream to his companion. Among other things they were conversing about, this man recounted: 'I saw a dream. It seemed to me as if a barley loaf of bread was rolling down and came into the camp of Midian. And when it reached a tent, it struck it and overturned it, completely throwing it down.'
Judges 7:14 The man to whom he was speaking answered, saying: 'This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon, the son of Joas, a man of Israel! The Lord has delivered Midian and all its camp into his hands.'
Judges 7:15 And when Gideon had heard the dream and its interpretation, he immediately worshiped God. He then returned to the camp of Israel and said: 'Arise, for the Lord has delivered the camp of Midian into our hands!'
Judges 7:16 He divided the three hundred men into three companies. To all of them, he gave trumpets in their hands, empty jars, and torches inside the jars.
Judges 7:17 And he said to them: 'Whatever you see me do, that is what you are to do. Follow your leader. Act exactly as I act.'
Judges 7:18 When I blow the trumpet, then you also, all around the camp, are to blow. And you are to say: 'The Lord's and Gideon's!'
Judges 7:19 So, Gideon and the three hundred men who were with him entered the part of the camp just after the middle watch of the night, right after the first guards had been stationed. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars they held among themselves.
Judges 7:20 When the trumpets had sounded in the three places, and the jars were broken, they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands, shouting: 'The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!'
Judges 7:21 Every man stood in his place all around the camp of Midian. All those in the camp were thrown into confusion, shouting and fleeing in terror.
Judges 7:22 And with only the three hundred men sounding their trumpets, the Lord turned every man's sword against his fellow, and they were slaughtered by mutual killing. They fled as far as Beth-shettah, and to the edge of Abel-meholah, near Tabbath.
Judges 7:23 Then, Israel, with men from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, were called out and pursued Midian.
Judges 7:24 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying: 'Come down to meet Midian and seize the water crossings as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan River.' So, all of Ephraim was called out, and they seized the water crossings as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.
Judges 7:25 They captured two Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeb. They killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeb at the Winepress of Zeb. And while they pressed Gideon from Midian, they cut off the heads of Oreb and Zeb and brought them to Gideon across the Jordan.
Judges 7:1 So Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, rose very early, and his entire army with him. They set up their camp near the spring of Harod. The Midianite camp, by contrast, was to the north, in the valley known for its prominence.
Judges 7:2 The Lord then said to Gideon, "You have too many men with you. I will not hand the Midianites over to such a large army, because if I did, the people of Israel might boast against me, saying, 'We saved ourselves by our own strength!'"
Judges 7:3 "Therefore, speak to the people and make this declaration for everyone to hear: 'Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn back now.'" So, twenty-two thousand men returned from Mount Gilead, leaving only ten thousand behind.
Judges 7:4 The Lord spoke to Gideon again, saying, "There are still too many men. Lead them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. Those about whom I tell you, 'This one shall go with you,' shall go. But everyone about whom I tell you, 'This one shall not go,' shall return."
Judges 7:5 So when Gideon led the men down to the water, the Lord said to him, "Everyone who laps the water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set aside by himself. Also, set aside everyone who kneels down to drink."
Judges 7:6 The number of men who lapped the water by bringing it to their mouths with their hands was three hundred. All the remaining men in the army drank by kneeling down.
Judges 7:7 And the Lord said to Gideon, "With these three hundred men who lapped the water, I will save you and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the rest of the army return to their own homes."
Judges 7:8 So Gideon took the provisions for the remaining people, as well as their trumpets, and sent all the rest of the Israelites back to their tents. Gideon himself, with only the three hundred men, prepared for battle. The Midianite camp was situated below them in the valley.
Judges 7:9 That very night, the Lord said to Gideon, "Get up! Go down into the enemy camp, for I have already delivered them into your hands."
Judges 7:10 "However, if you are afraid to go down by yourself, then go down with your servant, Pharah."
Judges 7:11 "And when you hear what they are saying, then your hands will be strengthened, and you will go into battle with more confidence." So Gideon and his servant Pharah went down to the edge of the camp where the armed guards were positioned.
Judges 7:12 The Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the peoples from the East were spread out across the valley, as numerous as a swarm of locusts. Their camels were likewise countless, like the grains of sand on the seashore.
Judges 7:13 When Gideon reached the camp, he heard one man telling his neighbor a dream. The man was saying, "I had a dream, and behold, a humble loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp, struck a tent, and completely overturned it to the ground!"
Judges 7:14 The man he was speaking to replied, "This dream can mean nothing other than the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, an Israelite man! God the Lord has delivered Midian and their entire army into his hands."
Judges 7:15 When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he immediately worshipped God. He then returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Arise! For the Lord has delivered the Midianite camp into our hands!"
Judges 7:16 Gideon divided the three hundred men into three separate companies. He gave each man a trumpet, an empty pitcher, and a torch to be hidden inside the pitcher.
Judges 7:17 And he said to them, "Watch me carefully, and do exactly as I do. When I go to the edge of the enemy camp, whatever I do there, you must imitate."
Judges 7:18 "When my trumpet sounds, along with the trumpets of everyone with me, then you also, all around the camp, must blow your trumpets and shout, 'A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!'"
Judges 7:19 So Gideon and the three hundred men with him entered the enemy camp just as the middle watch of the night was beginning, right after the guards had been posted. Immediately, they blew their trumpets and smashed the pitchers, revealing the bright torches.
Judges 7:20 and they all cried out, "A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!"
Judges 7:21 Each man stood in his position surrounding the enemy camp. All the Midianite soldiers were utterly terrified, crying out and fleeing in confusion.
Judges 7:22 As the three hundred men kept blowing their trumpets, the Lord caused all the Midianite soldiers in the camp to turn their swords against one another and strike each other down with mutual wounds.
Judges 7:23 Then, the men of Israel from Naphtali, Asher, and all of Manasseh, who had previously been sent home, were called to gather and pursue the fleeing Midianites.
Judges 7:24 Gideon also sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down to intercept the Midianites and seize the water crossings as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan River!" So, all the men of Ephraim gathered together with a great cry and secured the water crossings of the Jordan.
Judges 7:25 They captured two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeb. They killed Oreb at the Rock of Oreb and Zeb at the Winepress of Zeb. Then, continuing their pursuit of the Midianites, they brought the severed heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gideon, who was waiting beyond the Jordan River.
Judges 8:1 Then the men of Ephraim came to Gideon, very angry. They demanded of him, "What is this action you have taken? You did not call us to come with you when you went to fight against Midian!" They strongly argued with him and criticized him.
Judges 8:2 Gideon responded to them: "What have I done that could compare to what you have accomplished? Is not the gleaning done by Ephraim better than the full harvest of Abiezer?"
Judges 8:3 God Himself delivered the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeb, into your hands! How could anything I have done compare to that great deed of yours? After Gideon spoke this, their anger towards him subsided.
Judges 8:4 Gideon then reached the Jordan River and crossed it, along with the three hundred men who were with him. They were all exhausted but still in pursuit of the enemy.
Judges 8:5 He said to the men of Succoth: "Please give bread to the people who are with me, because they are weary. This way we can continue to pursue Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian, who are still fleeing."
Judges 8:6 But the officials of Succoth replied: "Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your power? Are they already captured? How can we give food to your army now?"
Judges 8:7 Gideon answered: "Because of this, when the Lord delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will crush your flesh with thorns and thistles from the wilderness."
Judges 8:8 From there, he went up to Penuel and spoke to its men in the same manner. The men of Penuel also gave him the same reply as the men of Succoth.
Judges 8:9 So Gideon told them as well: "When I return victorious, I will tear down this tower of yours."
Judges 8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were resting with their entire army, which numbered fifteen thousand men. These were all that remained from the vast camp of the Midianites, as one hundred twenty thousand warriors had already been killed.
Judges 8:11 Gideon went up by the route of the tent-dwellers, to the east of Nobah and Jogbehah. He struck the enemy camp when they felt secure and unsuspecting.
Judges 8:12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled, but Gideon pursued them and captured them, having thrown their entire army into a panic.
Judges 8:13 As Gideon returned from the battle, before sunrise,
Judges 8:14 he seized a young man from the men of Succoth. He questioned him, asking for the names of the leaders and elders of Succoth, and the young man wrote down seventy-seven men.
Judges 8:15 Then Gideon went to the men of Succoth and said: "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna! These are the men concerning whom you mocked me, saying: 'Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your grasp, that we should give bread to your weary men?'"
Judges 8:16 So Gideon took the elders of the city, along with thorns and thistles from the wilderness. With these, he punished and taught the men of Succoth a painful lesson.
Judges 8:17 He also tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the inhabitants of that city.
Judges 8:18 Then Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna: "What kind of men were those whom you killed at Tabor?" They replied: "They were like you, each one appearing as a king's son."
Judges 8:19 Gideon said to them: "They were my sons, my own brothers, whom you murdered! As the Lord lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you now."
Judges 8:20 Then he turned to Jether, his firstborn son, and said: "Arise, and kill them!" But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, for he was still a mere boy.
Judges 8:21 Zebah and Zalmunna then said to Gideon: "You yourself, arise and kill us. For a man's strength is according to his age." So Gideon rose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the ornaments from the necks of their camels.
Judges 8:22 Then all the men of Israel said to Gideon: "Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson, because you have delivered us from the hand of Midian."
Judges 8:23 But Gideon said to them: "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The Lord alone will rule over you."
Judges 8:24 And Gideon said to them: "I have one request to make of you. Give me the earrings from your plunder." (For the Ishmaelites, who were the Midianites, were accustomed to wearing golden earrings.)
Judges 8:25 They replied: "We will gladly give them!" So they spread out a cloak, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder.
Judges 8:26 The weight of the golden earrings that Gideon had requested was seventeen hundred shekels of gold. This was besides the ornate crescents, pendants, and purple garments that the kings of Midian usually wore, and also the chains from the camels' necks.
Judges 8:27 Gideon made an ephod from this gold and placed it in his city, Ophrah. All of Israel committed spiritual adultery by worshiping it there, and it became a snare and ruin for Gideon and his entire household.
Judges 8:28 So Midian was humbled before the sons of Israel and could no longer lift their heads in pride. The land enjoyed peace for forty years, throughout the time Gideon governed them.
Judges 8:29 Then Jerubbaal, who was Gideon the son of Joash, went and lived in his own house.
Judges 8:30 Gideon had seventy sons, who were his direct offspring, for he had many wives.
Judges 8:31 His concubine, whom he kept in Shechem, also bore him a son, whose name was Abimelech.
Judges 8:32 Gideon, the son of Joash, died at a good old age. He was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the family of the Abiezrites.
Judges 8:33 After Gideon died, the sons of Israel turned away from God and committed spiritual adultery with the Baals. They established a covenant with Baal-berith, promising to worship him as their god.
Judges 8:34 They did not remember the Lord their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their surrounding enemies.
Judges 8:35 Nor did they show kindness to the household of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, in return for all the good he had done for Israel.
Judges 8:1 The men of Ephraim said to Gideon, "What is this thing you have done? You did not call us when you went out to fight against Midian." And they argued with him very vehemently because of this.
Judges 8:2 To them, he replied, "What could I have done that was like what you have done? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the full harvest of Abiezer?"
Judges 8:3 God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeb. What could I have done that was like what you have accomplished? When he had spoken these words, their anger, with which they had been swelling, subsided.
Judges 8:4 Gideon then came to the Jordan River, and he crossed over, along with the three hundred men who were with him. They were exhausted and hungry.
Judges 8:5 And he said to the men of Succoth, "Please give bread to the people who are with me, because they are faint and extremely hungry. I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
Judges 8:6 The princes of Succoth replied, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your power, that we should give bread to your army?"
Judges 8:7 Gideon said, "Because of this, when the Lord has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will tear your flesh with the thorns and thistles of the wilderness."
Judges 8:8 From there, he also went up to Penuel and spoke to them in a similar way. The men of Penuel responded to him just as the men of Succoth had replied.
Judges 8:9 And he also said to them, "When I return victorious, I will destroy this tower."
Judges 8:10 Zebah and Zalmunna, however, were resting with their entire army, all fifteen thousand men who remained of all the eastern forces. Indeed, one hundred twenty thousand fighting men had already been slain.
Judges 8:11 And Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents, on the east side of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he struck the enemy's camp, because they felt secure.
Judges 8:12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and Gideon pursued them and captured them, throwing their entire army into confusion.
Judges 8:13 Gideon returned from the battle before the sun rose.
Judges 8:14 He seized a young man from the men of Succoth and questioned him about the names of the princes and elders of Succoth. The young man wrote down seventy-seven men.
Judges 8:15 Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your power, that we should give bread to your weary men?'"
Judges 8:16 So he took the elders of the city, and the thorns and thistles of the wilderness, and with them, he threshed and crushed the men of Succoth.
Judges 8:17 He also pulled down the tower of Penuel, killing its inhabitants.
Judges 8:18 And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men were those whom you killed at Tabor?" They replied, "They were like you, each one appearing like a son of a king."
Judges 8:19 To them, he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the Lord lives, if you had spared them, I would not kill you now."
Judges 8:20 Then he said to Jether, his firstborn son, "Rise and kill them." But he did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, for he was still a boy.
Judges 8:21 Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise yourself and kill us, for a man's strength is according to his age." So Gideon rose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the ornaments and the golden chains from their camels.
Judges 8:22 Then all the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you, and your son, and your grandson, because you have delivered us from the hand of Midian."
Judges 8:23 To them, he said, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The Lord alone will rule over you."
Judges 8:24 And he said to them, "I have one request to ask of you: give me the earrings from your plunder." For the Ishmaelites had golden earrings.
Judges 8:25 They replied, "We will gladly give them." Spreading out a cloak, they each threw into it the earrings they had been able to seize.
Judges 8:26 The weight of the golden earrings that he had requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the ornaments, necklaces, and the purple garments that the kings of Midian had worn, and the chains from the camels.
Judges 8:27 Gideon made an ephod from it and placed it in his city, Ophrah. And all of Israel prostituted themselves after it—worshipping this idol—and it became a ruin for Gideon and for all his house.
Judges 8:28 So Midian was humbled before the sons of Israel, and they could not lift up their heads any longer. And the land had rest for forty years, during the time Gideon ruled.
Judges 8:29 So Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and lived in his own house.
Judges 8:30 He had seventy sons who were born from his own body, for he had many wives.
Judges 8:31 And his concubine, whom he had in Shechem, bore him a son named Abimelech.
Judges 8:32 Gideon, the son of Joash, died in a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the family of Abiezrites.
Judges 8:33 After Gideon died, the sons of Israel turned away and prostituted themselves after the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god.
Judges 8:34 They did not remember the Lord their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies all around them.
Judges 8:35 Nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, in return for all the good that he had done for them.
Judges 8:36 At that time, Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, went to Shechem, to the brothers of his mother, and spoke to them and to all the relatives of his mother's family, saying:
Judges 8:37 "Which is better for you: that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rule over you? Consider also that I am your bone and your flesh."
Judges 8:38 The brothers of his mother spoke concerning him all these words to all the men of Shechem, and they inclined their hearts toward Abimelech, saying, "He is our brother."
Judges 8:39 They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith. With this money, he hired worthless and reckless men, and they followed him.
Judges 8:40 Then he came to his father's house in Ophrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal—seventy men—on one stone. Only Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, remained alive, because he had hidden himself.
Judges 9:1 Abimelech, who was the son of Jerubaal, went to Shechem, to his mother’s brothers. He spoke to them and to all the family of his mother’s father, saying:
Judges 9:2 “Tell the men of Shechem to listen carefully to what I say: Which is better for you—that seventy men rule over you, all the sons of Jerubaal, or that one man rule over you? Also, remind them that I am your own flesh and blood, your brother.”
Judges 9:3 His mother’s brothers then spoke all these words about Abimelech to all the men of Shechem. And the hearts of the men of Shechem were inclined toward Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother, after all.”
Judges 9:4 And so they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith. With this silver, Abimelech hired worthless and wandering men, and they followed him.
Judges 9:5 Abimelech then went to his father’s house in Ophrah. There, on a single stone, he killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubaal. Only Jotham, Jerubaal’s youngest son, remained alive because he had hidden himself.
Judges 9:6 So all the men of Shechem and all the families of the city of Millo gathered together. They went and made Abimelech king beside the oak tree that stood in Shechem.
Judges 9:7 When this was told to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim. He raised his voice and cried out, saying, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, and may God listen to you!”
Judges 9:8 “Once, the trees went out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree: ‘Rule over us.’
Judges 9:9 But the olive tree answered: ‘Can I give up my oil, by which both God and men are honored, and go to wave over the other trees?’
Judges 9:10 Then the trees said to the fig tree: ‘Come, you, and rule over us.’
Judges 9:11 But the fig tree answered them: ‘Can I give up my sweetness and my excellent fruit, and go to wave over the other trees?’
Judges 9:12 Then the trees spoke to the vine: ‘Come, and rule over us.’
Judges 9:13 But the vine answered: ‘Can I give up my wine, which gladdens both God and men, and go to wave over the other trees?’
Judges 9:14 Then all the trees said to the bramble: ‘Come, and rule over us.’
Judges 9:15 And the bramble answered them: ‘If you truly wish to anoint me as your king, then come and rest in my shadow. But if not, then let fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’
Judges 9:16 “Now then, if you have acted with sincerity and truth, and have dealt well with Jerubaal and his household, and have given him a fitting reward for the injuries he endured from you —
Judges 9:17 he who fought for you, who put his life in danger to deliver you from the hand of Midian —
Judges 9:18 and yet you have risen up today against my father’s household, and have killed his seventy sons upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, simply because he is your brother —
Judges 9:19 if therefore you have acted with sincerity and truth today with Jerubaal and his household, then rejoice today in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
Judges 9:20 But if you have not, then let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the inhabitants of Shechem and the house of Millo. And let fire come out from Shechem and from the house of Millo and consume Abimelech.”
Judges 9:21 When Jotham had finished cursing them, he fled to Beer, and he stayed there because of his brother Abimelech.
Judges 9:22 So Abimelech reigned over Israel for three years.
Judges 9:23 Then God sent an evil spirit to cause trouble between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Shechem. And the men of Shechem began to detest him.
Judges 9:24 This happened so that the evil done against Jerubaal’s sons might come to pass, and their blood would be avenged upon Abimelech, their brother, and upon the other Shechemites who had helped him kill his brothers.
Judges 9:25 And the men of Shechem set ambushes against him on the tops of the mountains. While they lay in wait for his coming, they committed robberies, taking plunder from those who passed by. This was reported to Abimelech.
Judges 9:26 But then Gaal, the son of Ebed, came with his brothers and moved into Shechem. At his arrival, the inhabitants of Shechem were encouraged.
Judges 9:27 They went out into the fields, harvested their vineyards, and trod the grapes in the winepresses. They then held feasts, and entering the temple of their god, they ate and drank together, and they cursed Abimelech.
Judges 9:28 Gaal, the son of Ebed, cried out: “Who is Abimelech, and who are we in Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubaal? And isn’t Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor, the founder of Shechem! Why should we serve this man?
Judges 9:29 If only I were given charge of this people, I would remove Abimelech! I would then say to Abimelech: ‘Gather your army and come out!’”
Judges 9:30 When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal, the son of Ebed, he became very angry.
Judges 9:31 He secretly sent messengers to Abimelech, saying: “Look, Gaal, the son of Ebed, has come to Shechem with his brothers, and he is stirring up the city against you.
Judges 9:32 Therefore, rise up at night with your people and lie in wait in the fields.
Judges 9:33 At first light, as the sun rises, rush upon the city. And when Gaal and his people come out against you, then do to him whatever you can.”
Judges 9:34 So Abimelech rose up at night with all his army, and they set ambushes near Shechem in four companies.
Judges 9:35 And Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and all the army with him rose up from their ambush.
Judges 9:36 Gaal saw the people and said to Zebul: “Look, a multitude is coming down from the mountains!” But Zebul answered him: “You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men’s heads, and you are being deceived by this error.”
Judges 9:37 Again, Gaal said: “Look, troops are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming by the road that looks toward the Diviners’ Oak.”
Judges 9:38 Then Zebul said to him: “Where is your mouth now, with which you said: ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Is this not the very people you despised? Go out now and fight against him!”
Judges 9:39 So Gaal went out, with the people of the city watching, and fought against Abimelech.
Judges 9:40 But Abimelech pursued him. Gaal was put to flight and wounded, and many dead bodies lay slaughtered all the way to the city gate.
Judges 9:1 Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, went to Shechem to his mother's brothers. He spoke to them and to all the relatives of his mother's household, saying:
Judges 9:2 "Please, speak to all the leaders of Shechem: Which is better for you: that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or that one man rules over you? Remember also that I am your own flesh and blood."
Judges 9:3 So his mother's brothers spoke all these words about him to all the leaders of Shechem. Their hearts were swayed to follow Abimelech, for they said: "He is our own flesh and blood, our brother."
Judges 9:4 Then they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the treasury of the temple of Baalphakor. With this money, he hired worthless and vagrant men, and they followed him.
Judges 9:5 He went to his father's house in Ephra and killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. But Joatham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, remained alive, because he had hidden himself.
Judges 9:6 Then all the men of Shechem and all the citizens of the city of Mello gathered together. They went and made Abimelech their king beside the oak tree that stood in Shechem.
Judges 9:7 When this was told to Joatham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Garizim. He raised his voice and cried out, saying: "Listen to me, you men of Shechem, and may God listen to you."
Judges 9:8 "The trees once went out to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Rule over us!'"
Judges 9:9 "But the olive tree answered: 'Can I truly leave my rich oil, which both God and men use, to go and be exalted among the trees?'"
Judges 9:10 "Then the trees said to the fig tree: 'Come and rule over us!'"
Judges 9:11 "But the fig tree answered: 'Can I truly leave my sweetness and my excellent fruits to go and be moved about among the other trees?'"
Judges 9:12 "So the trees spoke to the grapevine: 'Come and rule over us!'"
Judges 9:13 "But the grapevine answered: 'Can I truly leave my wine, which makes God and men joyful, to go and serve among the other trees?'"
Judges 9:14 "Then all the trees said to the bramble: 'Come and rule over us!'"
Judges 9:15 "And the bramble answered them: 'If you truly want to make me your king, then come and take shelter in my shadow. But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon!'"
Judges 9:16 "Now therefore, if you have acted rightly and without sin by making Abimelech your king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his household, and if you have repaid him for the good deeds he did for you, for he fought for you,"
Judges 9:17 "and risked his own life to deliver you from the power of Midian,"
Judges 9:18 "yet you have risen up against my father's household today and killed his seventy sons on one stone. You have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, simply because he is your brother."
Judges 9:19 "If, then, you have acted justly and without sin towards Jerubbaal and his household today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you."
Judges 9:20 "But if you have acted wickedly, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the men of Shechem and the city of Mello. And let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from the city of Mello and consume Abimelech!"
Judges 9:21 After Joatham had cried out these words, he fled and went to Bera, and lived there, fearing Abimelech, his brother.
Judges 9:22 So Abimelech reigned over Israel for three years.
Judges 9:23 Then the Lord sent a destructive spirit between Abimelech and the inhabitants of Shechem. They began to betray him.
Judges 9:24 This was so that the wickedness of killing the seventy sons of Jerubbaal would come upon them. Their blood would be avenged upon Abimelech, their brother who had killed them, and upon the men of Shechem who had helped him in his deeds.
Judges 9:25 The men of Shechem set up ambushes against him on the mountain peaks. While they waited for people in the passes, they committed robbery with no one stopping them.
Judges 9:26 Now Gaal, the son of Obed, came with his brothers and moved into Shechem. The inhabitants of Shechem welcomed him.
Judges 9:27 They went out into the fields, plundered the vineyards, and trampled the winepresses. They then held feasts in the temple of their god, eating and drinking together, and they cursed Abimelech.
Judges 9:28 Then Gaal, the son of Obed, cried out: "Who is Abimelech, and who are we in Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal? And isn't Zebul his servant? Serve the men of Emor, the father of Shechem! Why should we serve him?"
Judges 9:29 "If only this people were under my command, I would remove Abimelech from your midst!" He then dared Abimelech: "Gather your army and come!"
Judges 9:30 When Zebul, the city's leader, heard the words of Gaal, the son of Obed, he became very angry.
Judges 9:31 He secretly sent messengers to Abimelech, saying: "Behold, Gaal, the son of Obed, has come to Shechem with his brothers and is stirring up the city against you."
Judges 9:32 "Therefore, rise up at night with the people who are with you and lie in ambush in the field."
Judges 9:33 "Then, at dawn, when the sun rises, rush upon the city. And when he and his people come out against you, do to him whatever you can."
Judges 9:34 So Abimelech rose up with all his army by night and set ambushes near Shechem in four companies.
Judges 9:35 Gaal, the son of Obed, went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and all the army with him rose up from their ambush.
Judges 9:36 Gaal saw the people and said to Zebul: "Look! People are descending from the mountains!" Zebul answered him: "You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men's heads, and you are being deceived by this error."
Judges 9:37 Again Gaal said: "Look, people are descending from the highest point of the land, and one company is coming by the road that looks towards the diviners' oak."
Judges 9:38 Zebul answered him: "Where is your boasting now, when you said: 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Is this not the very people you despised? Go out now and fight against them!"
Judges 9:39 So Gaal went out, leading the citizens of Shechem, and fought against Abimelech.
Judges 9:40 Abimelech pursued him and put him to flight. Many fell wounded, all the way to the city gate.
Judges 10:1 After these events, Thola arose as a new leader in the nation of Israel. He was the son of Phua, who was Abimelech's paternal uncle. Thola was a man from the tribe of Issachar, and he lived in Samir, in the mountains of Ephraim.
Judges 10:2 He judged Israel for twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Samir.
Judges 10:3 After Thola, Jair the Galaadite arose. He judged Israel for twenty-two years.
Judges 10:4 He had thirty sons, who rode on thirty donkey colts. He also possessed thirty cities, which were named after him, 'Havoth Jair.' These cities retain that name to the present day in the land of Galaad.
Judges 10:5 Then Jair died and was buried in Camon.
Judges 10:6 But the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord. They served Baalim and Astaroth, and the gods of Syria, Sidon, Moab, the children of Ammon, and the Philistines. They abandoned the Lord and did not serve Him.
Judges 10:7 So the Lord became angry with Israel and delivered them into the hands of the Philistines and the children of Ammon.
Judges 10:8 For eighteen years, all the children of Israel who were beyond the Jordan—in the land of the Amorrhites, in Galaad—were afflicted and crushed.
Judges 10:9 The oppression was so severe that they even crossed the Jordan and ravaged Juda, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Israel became greatly distressed.
Judges 10:10 Then the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, saying, 'We have sinned against You, for we have forsaken the Lord our God and have served Baalim.'
Judges 10:11 And the Lord said to the children of Israel, 'Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, the Amorrhites, the children of Ammon, and the Philistines?'
Judges 10:12 'When the Sidonians, Amalech, and the Chananæans oppressed you, you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hand.'
Judges 10:13 'Yet you have forsaken Me and served strange gods. Therefore, I will no longer deliver you.'
Judges 10:14 'Go and invoke the gods whom you have chosen. Let them deliver you in the time of your distress.'
Judges 10:15 Then the children of Israel said to the Lord, 'We have sinned; do to us whatever pleases You. Only deliver us now.'
Judges 10:16 And they cast away the strange gods from their midst and served the Lord, who was moved by their miseries.
Judges 10:17 Immediately, the children of Ammon were gathered together in Galaad and encamped there. When the children of Israel saw them, they also gathered in Maspha.
Judges 10:18 And the princes of Galaad said, each to his neighbor, 'Whoever among us first begins to fight against the children of Ammon shall be the leader of the people of Galaad.'
Judges 11:1 There was a man named Jephthah the Gileadite, a very strong warrior. He was the son of a prostitute woman, and Gilead was his father.
Judges 11:2 But when Gilead’s lawful wife had borne sons, and these sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out. They said, 'You will not be allowed to inherit anything in our father’s house, because you are the son of another woman.'
Judges 11:3 So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. There, desperate men gathered to him, and they went out on raids with him.
Judges 11:4 After many days passed, the Ammonites began to fight against Israel.
Judges 11:5 As the Ammonites continued their advance, the elders of Gilead went to Jephthah in the land of Tob,
Judges 11:6 and said to him, 'Come, and be our leader so you can fight against the Ammonites.'
Judges 11:7 Jephthah answered them, 'Was it not you who hated me and drove me from my father’s house? Why have you come to me now, only when you are in trouble?'
Judges 11:8 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, 'For this reason, we have indeed come to you now. If you go with us and fight against the Ammonites, you will be the head of all who live in Gilead.'
Judges 11:9 Jephthah said to them, 'If you bring me back to fight for you against the Ammonites, and if the Lord gives them into my hand, then I will be your leader.'
Judges 11:10 The princes of Gilead said to Jephthah, 'The Lord, who hears these things, will be the judge and witness of our agreement.'
Judges 11:11 So Jephthah went with the princes of Gilead, and all the people made him their leader and commander. Then Jephthah repeated all his intentions and terms before the Lord in Mizpah.
Judges 11:12 Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites with a message from him, saying: 'What conflict do you have with me, that you have come against me to lay waste my land?'
Judges 11:13 The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah: 'Because Israel took my land when they came up from Egypt, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan River. Now therefore, restore those lands to me peacefully.'
Judges 11:14 Jephthah again sent messengers back to the king of the Ammonites,
Judges 11:15 to tell him: 'This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab, nor the land of the Ammonites.'
Judges 11:16 Instead, when they were coming out of Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea and then came to Kadesh.
Judges 11:17 Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Allow me to pass through your land.' But Edom’s king would not agree to their requests. They also sent to the king of Moab, who likewise denied them passage. So Israel remained in Kadesh.
Judges 11:18 So Israel circled around the wilderness and all the land of Edom and Moab, and they came to the eastern side of the land of Moab. They camped beyond the Arnon River, because they did not want to enter the territory of Moab. Indeed, the Arnon forms the border between Moab and the Amorites.
Judges 11:19 Therefore, Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and they said to him: 'Allow us to pass through your land to our own river.'
Judges 11:20 But even Sihon, not trusting that Israel would merely pass through his territory, gathered a large army and came to Jahaz, where he resisted them.
Judges 11:21 Then the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon with all his army into the hand of Israel, who struck him down and took possession of all the land of the Amorite inhabitants of that region.
Judges 11:22 And all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River, and from the wilderness to the Jordan River.
Judges 11:23 Therefore, the Lord God of Israel overthrew the Amorites, who dwelt in the land of Canaan, before His people Israel. And now, do you intend to possess it yourself?
Judges 11:24 Do you not possess by right whatever your god Chemosh allows you to possess? So, whatever the Lord our God victoriously obtained, shall that not become our possession?
Judges 11:25 Are you perhaps better than Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Or can you command anything against him?
Judges 11:26 When Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the Jordan River, for three hundred years—why did you not attempt anything regarding this matter during all that time?
Judges 11:27 Therefore, I have not sinned against you, but you are acting wickedly against me by bringing war upon me. May the Lord, the Judge, decide this day between Israel and the Ammonites.
Judges 11:28 But the king of the Ammonites would not agree to the words that Jephthah had sent to him through messengers.
Judges 11:29 Therefore, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he marched through Gilead and Manasseh, even Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he crossed over to the Ammonites.
Judges 11:30 Then Jephthah made a solemn vow to the Lord, saying: 'If You will indeed deliver the Ammonites into my hands,'
Judges 11:31 then whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the Ammonites, will be a burnt offering to the Lord.'
Judges 11:32 So Jephthah went over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the Lord delivered them into his hand.
Judges 11:33 And he struck them down from Aroer all the way to Minnith, capturing twenty cities, and even to Abel-keramim, which was filled with vineyards, with an exceedingly great slaughter. Thus, the Ammonites were humbled before the Israelites.
Judges 11:34 Now when Jephthah returned to his house in Mizpah, his only daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and dances, for she was the first to come to meet him. Indeed, she was his only daughter.
Judges 11:35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried out: 'Alas, my daughter! You have truly undone me, and you yourself are undone, for I have opened my mouth with a vow to the Lord, and I cannot go back on it!'
Judges 11:36 To him, she replied: 'My father, if you have opened your mouth to the Lord with a vow, then do to me whatever you have promised, since by this, the Lord’s vengeance has been fully accomplished against your enemies through you.'
Judges 11:37 Then she said to her father: 'Grant me only this one thing that I ask: let me go for two months so I can wander the mountains and lament my virginity with my companions.'
Judges 11:38 He replied to her, 'Go.' And he sent her away for two months. So she departed with her companions and bewailed her virginity in the mountains.
Judges 11:39 When the two months were over, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she had never known a man. From that time on, a custom spread throughout Israel and became established:
Judges 11:40 that after a year’s cycle, the daughters of Israel would gather together and lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days.
Judges 11:2 Gilead's legitimate wife bore him sons. When these sons grew up, they drove Jephthah away, telling him: "You cannot inherit anything in our father's house because your mother was a prostitute."
Judges 11:3 So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. There, desperate and impoverished men gathered around him and became his followers, engaging in raids with him.
Judges 11:4 A short time later, the Ammonites began to wage war against the people of Israel.
Judges 11:5 As the war intensified, the elders of Gilead went to the land of Tob to summon Jephthah back to them.
Judges 11:6 They said to him: "Come and become our leader, and fight against the Ammonites for us."
Judges 11:7 Jephthah replied to them: "Were you not the ones who hated me and drove me out from my father's house? Why do you come to me now, only when you are forced by necessity?"
Judges 11:8 But they said to Jephthah: "For this very reason we have come to you now—so that you may go with us and fight against the Ammonites, and you will become the head over all who live in Gilead."
Judges 11:9 Jephthah then said to them: "If you have truly come to me so that I may fight for you against the Ammonites, and if the Lord hands the enemy into my power, will I truly be your leader?"
Judges 11:10 They answered him: "The Lord, who hears these words, He Himself is the arbiter and witness, that what we have promised, we will fulfill in deed."
Judges 11:11 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and all the people made him their leader and commander. Jephthah then spoke all his solemn words and promises before the Lord in Mizpah.
Judges 11:12 Jephthah then sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, to say in his name: "What dispute is between us, that you have come against me to lay waste to my land?"
Judges 11:13 To them, the king of Ammon replied: "Because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt, from the borders of the Arnon River all the way to the Jabbok River and the Jordan River. Therefore, return it to me now peacefully."
Judges 11:14 Jephthah, in turn, sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites.
Judges 11:15 He commanded them to tell the Ammonite king: "Jephthah says this: Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the Ammonites."
Judges 11:16 "Instead, when they came out of Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and then they came to Kadesh."
Judges 11:17 "Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: 'Allow me to pass through your land.' But he refused to agree to their requests. They also sent to the king of Moab, who likewise scorned to grant them passage. So Israel remained in Kadesh."
Judges 11:18 "And so, Israel went around all the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and they came to the eastern side of the land of Moab. They camped beyond the Arnon River, and they did not wish to enter the territory of Moab, because the Arnon River was indeed the border of the land of Moab."
Judges 11:19 "Therefore, Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and they said to him: 'Allow us to pass through your land all the way to the river.'"
Judges 11:20 "But he also did not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, he gathered his army, went out against them at Jahaz, and strongly resisted them in battle."
Judges 11:21 "And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon with all his army into the hand of Israel. Israel defeated him and took possession of all the land of that region's Amorite inhabitants."
Judges 11:22 "And they possessed all his territory, from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River, and from the wilderness to the Jordan River."
Judges 11:23 "So then, the Lord God of Israel drove out the Amorites, with His people Israel fighting against them. And now you, Ammonites, want to take possession of their land, which is now ours?"
Judges 11:24 "Do you not possess by right whatever Chemosh, your god, has given you? So also, what the Lord our God has victoriously obtained, shall pass into our possession."
Judges 11:25 "Unless perhaps you are greater than Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, or you can command him to do something."
Judges 11:26 "For three hundred years, Israel has lived in Heshbon and its surrounding villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the Jordan River. Why, during all this time, have you not attempted anything about this matter?"
Judges 11:27 "Therefore, I have not sinned against you. Rather, you are acting wickedly against me by bringing unjust wars upon me. May the Lord, the Judge, decide today between Israel and the Ammonites."
Judges 11:28 But the king of the Ammonites refused to listen to the words that Jephthah had sent to him through his messengers.
Judges 11:29 Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, empowering him. He passed through Gilead and Manasseh, then through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.
Judges 11:30 And Jephthah made a solemn vow to the Lord, saying: "If You will deliver the Ammonites into my hand,"
Judges 11:31 "Then whoever comes out first from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites, that person I will offer up as a burnt offering to the Lord." This vow indicates a human sacrifice, a forbidden practice, which Jephthah misunderstands as pleasing to God.
Judges 11:32 So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the Lord delivered them into his hand.
Judges 11:33 He struck them down from Aroer all the way to Minnith, capturing twenty cities, and continuing as far as Abel-Keramim, which means "plain of the vineyards," inflicting an exceedingly great slaughter upon them. Thus, the Ammonites were subdued by the people of Israel.
Judges 11:34 When Jephthah returned to his house in Mizpah, his only daughter came out to meet him, celebrating with tambourines and dances. She was his only child; he had no other sons or daughters.
Judges 11:35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried out: "Oh, my daughter! You have brought me to despair, and you yourself are in despair! I have opened my mouth in a solemn vow to the Lord, and I cannot go back on it."
Judges 11:36 To him, she replied: "My father, if you have opened your mouth in a vow to the Lord, do to me whatever you have promised, since the Lord has granted you victory and vengeance over your enemies."
Judges 11:37 She then said to her father: "Grant me only this one request: let me go for two months to wander among the mountains and mourn my virginity with my companions."
Judges 11:38 He answered her: "Go." And he sent her away for two months. When she had gone with her companions, she wept over her virginity in the mountains.
Judges 11:39 When the two months were completed, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. She had known no man, remaining a virgin. From that time on, a custom prevailed in Israel and was observed:
Judges 11:40 That year after year, the daughters of Israel would gather together and lament for the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, for four days.
Judges 12:1 The men from the tribe of Ephraim then gathered themselves and crossed to the northern region, confronting Jephthah. They demanded: "Why did you go to war against the Ammonites, and not call us to come with you? You will not get away with this insult to our honor; we will burn you and your entire household with fire!"
Judges 12:2 Jephthah replied to them: "My people and I endured fierce battles against the Ammonites. And when I desperately called for your help, you did not provide any assistance."
Judges 12:3 Seeing that you were unwilling to offer any assistance, I risked my life and went against the Ammonites. The Lord delivered them into my hands. Why, then, have you come today to fight against me?
Judges 12:4 Jephthah then said to all the men of Gilead: "The conflict is now between me, all of you, and Ephraim. For they have said, 'You Gileadites are nothing but runaways from among Ephraim and Manasseh!'"
Judges 12:5 Therefore, the Gileadites occupied all the fords of the Jordan River, through which the men of Ephraim were expected to return. When any man from Ephraim approached them there and said, "Please let me cross over,"
Judges 12:6 The Gileadites would ask him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" When he answered, "No, I am not," they would say, "Then say 'Shibboleth'—"a word that means 'ear of grain'. If he pronounced it differently from how it sounded to their ears, he was immediately seized and killed at the Jordan River fords. At that time, forty-two thousand men from Ephraim died in this way.
Judges 12:7 So Jephthah the Gileadite judged Israel for six years. Then he died and was buried in his city, Gilead.
Judges 12:8 After him, Abesan from Bethlehem judged Israel.
Judges 12:9 He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He sent his daughters out to be married, and brought wives for his sons from outside his family. He judged Israel for seven years.
Judges 12:10 Then he died and was buried in Bethlehem.
Judges 12:11 Ahialon the Zebulunite succeeded him and judged Israel for eight years.
Judges 12:12 Then he died and was buried in Zebulun.
Judges 12:13 After him, Abdon, the son of Hillel, from Pirathon, judged Israel.
Judges 12:14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, and they rode on seventy young donkeys—a sign of their wealth and status. He judged Israel for eight years.
Judges 12:15 Then he died and was buried in Pirathon, in the land of Ephraim, on the mount of the Amalekites.
Judges 13:1 The sons of Israel once again did evil in the sight of the Lord God. So He delivered them into the power of the Philistines for forty long years.
Judges 13:2 Now there was a man from Zorah, from the tribe of Dan, whose name was Manoah. His wife was barren, and she had not been able to bear any children.
Judges 13:3 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah's wife and told her: "You are barren and without children, but you are going to conceive and give birth to a son."
Judges 13:4 "Therefore, be careful not to drink any wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean."
Judges 13:5 "For you will conceive and give birth to a son whose head no razor blade shall touch. This is because he will be a Nazirite, consecrated to the Lord God from his very birth, from his mother's womb. And he himself will begin to deliver Israel from the power of the Philistines."
Judges 13:6 So the woman went and told her husband, saying: "A man of God came to me, with an angelic appearance, very awe-inspiring. When I asked him where he was from and what his name was, he refused to tell me."
Judges 13:7 "Instead, he responded with this: 'Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. Be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from his mother's womb until the day of his death.'"
Judges 13:8 So Manoah prayed to the Lord God, saying: "Oh, please, Lord, let the man of God whom You sent come to us again, and teach us what we ought to do for the boy who is about to be born."
Judges 13:9 And the Lord God heard Manoah's prayer. Again, the angel of the Lord appeared to his wife while she was sitting in the field. But Manoah, her husband, was not with her.
Judges 13:10 When she saw the angel, she hurried and ran to her husband, announcing to him: "Look, the man whom I saw before has appeared to me again!"
Judges 13:11 Manoah arose and followed his wife. When they came to the man, Manoah asked him: "Are you the one who spoke with this woman?" And he answered: "I am."
Judges 13:12 Manoah then asked him: "When your message is fulfilled, what do you want the boy to do? Or by what rules should he live?"
Judges 13:13 The angel of the Lord answered Manoah: "From everything I told your wife, he must abstain."
Judges 13:14 "Whatever comes from the grapevine he shall not eat. He must not drink wine or strong drink, and he shall not eat anything unclean. All that I commanded, he must observe."
Judges 13:15 Manoah then said to the angel of the Lord: "Please, stay a little while, and we will prepare a young goat for you."
Judges 13:16 The angel of the Lord answered him: "Even if you compel me, I will not eat your food. But if you wish to offer a burnt offering, offer it to the Lord God." Manoah did not realize that it was an angel of the Lord.
Judges 13:17 Manoah then said to the angel of the Lord: "What is your name, so that when your message is fulfilled, we may honor you?"
Judges 13:18 To this, he responded: "Why do you ask my name? It is wondrous, beyond understanding."
Judges 13:19 So Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering, and he placed them on a rock, offering them to the Lord God, who performs wondrous acts.
Judges 13:20 As the flame ascended from the altar toward the sky, the angel of the Lord also ascended in the flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell face down to the ground.
Judges 13:21 The angel of the Lord did not appear to them again. Then Manoah understood that it had been an angel of the Lord.
Judges 13:22 And he said to his wife: "We will surely die, because we have seen God."
Judges 13:23 His wife responded to him: "If the Lord God had wished to kill us, He would not have accepted the burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have told us what is to come."
Judges 13:24 So the woman gave birth to a son, and she named him Samson. The boy grew, and the Lord God blessed him.
Judges 13:25 And the Spirit of the Lord God began to be with him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Judges 14:1 Samson then went down to Timnah. There, he saw a young woman who was one of the daughters of the Philistines.
Judges 14:2 He returned and told his father and his mother, saying: 'I saw a young woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines. So now, get her for me as my wife.'
Judges 14:3 His father and mother said to him: 'Is there not a young woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all your people, so that you would take a wife from among the uncircumcised Philistines?' But Samson said to his father: 'Get this one for me, because she pleases my eyes.'
Judges 14:4 But his parents did not know that this was from the Lord, who was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines. For at that time, the Philistines ruled over Israel.
Judges 14:5 So Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah. When they came to the vineyards near the town, a young lion roared and sprang out against him.
Judges 14:6 Then the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon Samson, and he tore the lion apart as if it were a young goat, even though he had nothing in his hand. He did not want to tell his father or his mother what he had done.
Judges 14:7 He went down again and spoke with the young woman who had pleased his eyes.
Judges 14:8 After some days, when he returned to take her as his wife, he turned aside to see the lion's carcass. And behold, there was a swarm of bees in the lion's mouth, and a honeycomb.
Judges 14:9 When he had taken the honeycomb from the lion's body, he ate some as he walked. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they ate it. But he did not want to tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion's body.
Judges 14:10 So his father went down to the young woman's house. Samson then held a wedding feast there, for it was customary for young men to do so.
Judges 14:11 When the local citizens saw him, they gave him thirty companions.
Judges 14:12 Samson said to them: 'I will propose a riddle to you. If you can solve it for me within the seven days of the feast and tell me the correct answer, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.'
Judges 14:13 'But if you cannot solve it, then you will give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.' They replied: 'Propose your riddle so we can hear it.'
Judges 14:14 So he said to them: 'Out of the eater came something to eat, and out of the strong came something sweet.' And they could not solve the riddle for three days.
Judges 14:15 When the fourth day came, they said to Samson's wife: 'Coax your husband and get him to tell you what the riddle means. Otherwise, we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Were we invited to this wedding just to be impoverished?'
Judges 14:16 So Samson's wife wept before him and said: 'You hate me and do not love me! That is why you have not told me the riddle you proposed to my countrymen!' He replied: 'I wouldn't even tell my own father and mother, so why should I tell you?'
Judges 14:17 Yet she wept before him for the remaining seven days of the feast. At last, on the seventh day, overcome by her nagging, he told her. She immediately told all her countrymen the answer.
Judges 14:18 So before the sun set on the seventh day, the men of the city said to him: 'What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?' He said to them: 'If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle.'
Judges 14:19 Then the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon Samson, and he went down to Ashkelon. There, he killed thirty men. He took their spoils and gave their garments to those who had solved the riddle. Then, in a fit of intense rage, he returned to his father's house.
Judges 14:20 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.

Judges 15:1 Now, after some time had passed, during the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife, bringing a young goat as a gift. And he said: 'I am going into my wife's room.' But her husband (Samson's father-in-law) did not allow him to.
Judges 15:2 And her father-in-law, Samson's father-in-law, said: 'I thought you truly hated her, so I gave her to your friend. But look, her younger sister is more beautiful! Take her instead.'
Judges 15:3 Samson replied: 'From this moment on, no Philistine can blame me for anything. I will certainly bring harm upon you people.'
Judges 15:4 So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes. He then tied their tails together, two by two, and placed a torch between each pair of tied tails.
Judges 15:5 He lit the torches, then released the foxes so they would run through the Philistine fields. Immediately, the crops caught fire—both the harvested grain that was already stacked, and the grain still standing in the stalks. Thus, the entire Philistine region was consumed by fire.
Judges 15:6 The Philistines asked, 'Who did this?' They were told: 'Samson, the son-in-law of the man from Timnah, because he took Samson's wife and gave her to another man.' So the Philistines went up and killed her and her father by fire.
Judges 15:7 Samson said to them: 'Since you have done such a cruel thing, I will not rest until I have had my revenge on you.'
Judges 15:8 Then he struck them with a mighty blow, causing them to be crippled and fall. Afterward, he went down and stayed in the cave of the rock of Etam.
Judges 15:9 Therefore, the Philistines went up into the land of Judah and camped at Lehi—which means 'Jawbone Hill'.
Judges 15:10 The men of the tribe of Judah asked them: 'Why have you come up against us?' The Philistines answered: 'We have come to tie up Samson and make him pay for what he has done to us.'
Judges 15:11 So three thousand men from Judah went down from the rock of Etam and said to Samson: 'Don't you know that the Philistines rule over us? Why did you want to do this to us?' He replied: 'Just as they did to me, so I did to them.'
Judges 15:12 They said: 'We have come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.' Samson said to them: 'Swear to me that you yourselves will not kill me.'
Judges 15:13 They responded: 'No, we will not kill you; we will only tie you up and hand you over.' So they tied him with two new ropes and took him from the rock of Etam.
Judges 15:14 When he came to the place called Jawbone Hill, and the Philistines rushed to meet him, shouting in triumph, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly came upon Samson with overwhelming power. His ropes became like burned flax, which easily comes apart at the touch of fire. His bonds simply melted away from his hands.
Judges 15:15 He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey lying there. Grabbing it, he used it to kill a thousand men.
Judges 15:16 And Samson said: 'With the jawbone of a donkey, indeed, with the jawbone of a young donkey, I have killed a thousand men!'
Judges 15:17 When he had finished speaking these words, he threw the jawbone from his hand and called that place Ramath-Lehi, which means 'Jawbone Elevation' or 'Hill of the Jawbone'.
Judges 15:18 But then a terrible thirst oppressed him. He cried out to the Lord, saying: 'You, Lord, have given this great deliverance into the hand of your servant. And now, look, I am dying of thirst and will fall into the hands of these uncircumcised enemies!'
Judges 15:19 So the Lord opened a spring from a hollow place in the jawbone (or perhaps, a hollow in Lehi itself), and water flowed out from it. After Samson drank from it, his spirit was revived, and he regained his strength. Because of this, that place was called En-hakkore, meaning 'Spring of the One Who Calls,' which is at Jawbone Hill, even to this present day.
Judges 15:20 And Samson judged Israel for twenty years during the time of the Philistines' dominance.

Judges 15:1 After some days had passed, when the wheat harvest was finished, Samson returned to visit his wife, bringing her a young goat. And he said to her father, “I am going to my wife in her room.”
Judges 15:2 Her father answered him, “I truly believed that you hated her, and therefore I gave her to your friend. But look, she has a younger sister who is more beautiful than her; take her instead of your wife.”
Judges 15:3 Samson then said to him, “I am innocent concerning the Philistines at this time, for I will surely bring them trouble anyway.”
Judges 15:4 And he went and began to catch three hundred foxes. He tied their tails together in pairs and placed a torch between each pair of tails.
Judges 15:5 He lit the torches on fire, then released the foxes into the Philistines’ grain fields. The flames immediately burned up the standing grain, both in the fields and in the vineyards and olive groves, causing widespread destruction.
Judges 15:6 Then the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” And they were told, “Samson, the son-in-law of the man from Timnah, because he took his wife and gave her to another man.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.
Judges 15:7 Samson said to them, “Since you have done this, I will surely take revenge on you for this injustice, and then I will be satisfied.”
Judges 15:8 And he struck them down with a mighty blow, crushing them from thigh to shin. Then he went down and stayed in the cave in the rock of Etam.
Judges 15:9 Then the Philistines went up into the land of Judah and camped in a place that was later called Lehi, which means 'Jawbone,' where their army had gathered.
Judges 15:10 The tribe of Judah asked them, “Why have you come up against us?” They answered, “We have come to tie up Samson and hand him over to the Philistines, for he has done evil things to us.”
Judges 15:11 So three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam, where they tied Samson up and delivered him to the Philistines.
Judges 15:12 When they reached the place of Lehi, the Philistines rushed to meet him, shouting. But the Spirit of the Lord powerfully came upon Samson, and the ropes that bound him became like flax threads consumed by fire, and his loosened restraints fell from his hands.
Judges 15:13 He then found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, which was lying there at that time, and he took it up and killed a thousand men with it.
Judges 15:14 And Samson said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, with the jawbone of a young donkey, I have completely defeated them and struck down a thousand men.”
Judges 15:15 When he had finished speaking these words, he threw the jawbone from his hand and called the name of that place Ramath Lehi, which means 'Jawbone Heights' —a memorial to his victory.
Judges 15:16 Then, being intensely thirsty, he cried out to the Lord and said, “You have granted this great deliverance into the hand of your servant. And now, behold, I am dying of thirst and will fall into the hands of the uncircumcised Philistines.”
Judges 15:17 So God opened a hollow place in the jawbone at Lehi, and water came out from it. Samson drank, and his spirit was revived, and he regained his strength. Because of this, the name of that spring was called En Hakkore, meaning 'Spring of Him Who Called,' and it is known by that name to this very day.
Judges 15:18 And Samson judged Israel for twenty years during the time of the Philistines’ rule.
Judges 15:19 Samson then went to Gaza, and there he saw a prostitute, and he went in to her.
Judges 15:20 And when they had laid down, he drew his sword and killed them. And when he drew swords to enter—this phrasing is notably ambiguous in the Clementine Vulgate—they knew.
Judges 16:1 Samson traveled to Gaza. While there, he saw a harlot, and he went in to be with her.
Judges 16:2 When the Philistines heard about this, they immediately shut the city gates. They posted guards there all night, waiting silently, planning to kill Samson when he tried to escape in the morning. However, Samson slept only until the middle of the night. Rising at midnight, he seized the city gates along with both doorposts and the heavy crossbar. He hoisted the entire assembly onto his shoulders, carrying it all the way to the top of the mountain that overlooks Hebron.
Judges 16:3 After these events, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the Sorek valley.
Judges 16:4 The Philistine lords came to Delilah and said to her, “Deceive Samson. Find out from him what makes him so incredibly strong, and how we might overcome him, so we can bind and subdue him. Each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver if you succeed.”
Judges 16:5 So Delilah spoke to Samson, “Please tell me, what is the secret of your exceptional strength, and what could bind you to hold you captive?”
Judges 16:6 Samson answered her, “If I am bound with seven fresh, undried bowstrings that have been twisted together, I will become weak, just like any other man.”
Judges 16:7 Then the Philistine lords brought her seven such bowstrings, still fresh as he had described, and she used them to bind him.
Judges 16:8 Some Philistine men were lying in ambush in her bedroom. Delilah cried out to Samson, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” But he snapped the bonds as easily as a thread of tow breaks when it touches fire. The secret of his strength remained unknown.
Judges 16:9 Delilah said to him, “See? You have mocked me and told me lies! Now, please tell me truly how you can be bound.”
Judges 16:10 Samson answered her, “If I am bound with new ropes that have never been used for any work, I will become weak, just like any other man.”
Judges 16:11 So Delilah bound him with new ropes and again cried out, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” while the men lay hidden in the bedroom. But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were mere threads.
Judges 16:12 Delilah then said to Samson, “How long will you keep deceiving me and telling me lies? Tell me how you can be overcome!” He replied, “If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom, and then fasten it down with a peg into the ground, I will become weak and just like any other man.”
Judges 16:13 So Delilah did this; she wove his seven braids into the fabric and fastened it with a peg to the ground. Then she cried out to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” He awoke from his sleep and pulled out the peg, along with the loom and the fabric.
Judges 16:14 Then Delilah said to him, “How can you claim to love me when your heart isn't truly with me? You have lied to me three times, and you still refuse to tell me the secret of your extraordinary strength.”
Judges 16:15 Because she was so bothersome to him, constantly pressing him with her pleas and questions day after day, his soul became distressed to the point of death.
Judges 16:16 He finally revealed his whole heart to her and said, “No razor has ever touched my head, because I have been a Nazirite, consecrated to God, from my mother’s womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would depart from me, I would become weak, all my power would leave me, and I would be just like any other man.”
Judges 16:17 When Delilah saw that he had fully revealed his heart to her, she sent a message to the Philistine lords, saying, “Come up once more, for he has now opened his whole heart to me.” So they came up, bringing the money they had promised.
Judges 16:18 Delilah made Samson sleep with his head resting on her lap. Then she called for a barber and had him shave off the seven braids of Samson’s head. Delilah then began to torment him, and his strength immediately departed from him.
Judges 16:19 She cried out to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” He woke from his sleep, thinking to himself, “I will go out as I did before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him.
Judges 16:20 So the Philistines seized him. They immediately gouged out his eyes and led him down to Gaza. They bound him with bronze chains and put him in prison, making him grind grain.
Judges 16:21 However, his hair had already begun to grow back.
Judges 16:22 The Philistine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon and to celebrate, saying, “Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.”
Judges 16:23 And when the people saw him, they also praised their god, saying the same thing: “Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, who devastated our land and killed so many of us.”
Judges 16:24 Overflowing with joy and feasting with great enthusiasm, they commanded that Samson be called to entertain them. When he was brought from the prison, he performed for them, and they made him stand between two pillars.
Judges 16:25 Then Samson said to the boy who was guiding him, “Let me feel the pillars that support this entire house, so I can lean against them and rest for a moment.”
Judges 16:26 The house was full of men and women; all the Philistine lords were present, and on the roof, about three thousand men and women were watching Samson entertain them.
Judges 16:27 Samson then called out to the Lord, saying, “Lord God, remember me, I beg you. Strengthen me just this once more, my God, so that I may take revenge on my enemies for my two eyes.”
Judges 16:28 Then, gripping the two central pillars that supported the house, one with his right hand and the other with his left, he declared, “Let my soul die with the Philistines!”
Judges 16:29 With all his might, he pushed the pillars, and immediately the house collapsed, bringing down all the lords and everyone else who was in it. So Samson killed many more people at his death than he had killed during his entire life.
Judges 16:30 Then his brothers and all his family came down, took his body, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the tomb of Manoah, his father. Samson had judged Israel for twenty years.
Judges 16:1 Samson also traveled to the city of Gaza, and there he saw a harlot woman, and he went in to her.
Judges 16:2 When the Philistines heard, and knew that Samson had come to Gaza, they surrounded him, and laid in wait by the city gates all night. They were silent, saying to themselves: "We will ambush him until morning, and then we will kill him."
Judges 16:3 But Samson remained there until midnight. Then he arose, and took hold of both doors of the city gate, along with their posts and the bar, and he placed them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the mountain that faces Hebron.
Judges 16:4 After this, Samson fell in love with a woman who lived in the Valley of Sorek, and her name was Delilah.
Judges 16:5 The lords of the Philistines came to her and said: "Deceive him, and learn from him where his great strength lies, and how we might overcome him and bind him to afflict him. We, for our part, will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."
Judges 16:6 So Delilah said to Samson: "Tell me, I beg you, where your greatest strength lies, and what could bind you so that you could not escape."
Judges 16:7 And Samson said to her: "If I am bound with seven fresh cords, not yet dried, such as new bowstrings are usually made, then I will become weak, and be like any other man."
Judges 16:8 So the lords of the Philistines brought her seven ropes, like cords, not yet dry, with which she bound him.
Judges 16:9 While men lay hidden with her in the bedroom, she cried out: "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And he snapped the cords as a strand of flax is snapped if it touches fire. And his strength was still unknown.
Judges 16:10 Then Delilah said to Samson: "Look, you have mocked me and spoken falsely! At least now tell me how you ought to be bound."
Judges 16:11 Samson answered her: "If I am bound with new ropes that have never been used for work, then I will become weak, and be like any other man."
Judges 16:12 So Delilah bound him with new ropes and cried out: "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" (The men were hidden with her in the bedroom.) And he snapped them like thread in his hands.
Judges 16:13 And Delilah said to Samson: "How long will you mock me and speak falsely? Show me how you can be bound!" Samson answered her: "If I weave the seven locks of my head with the warp, and fasten them with a peg into the ground, then I will become weak, and be like any other man."
Judges 16:14 So Delilah fastened them with a peg and a nail into the ground. And she said to him: "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he rose from sleep, and pulled out the peg and the warp threads.
Judges 16:15 And Delilah said to him: "How can you say that you love me, when your heart is not with me? Three times you have lied to me, and you refused to tell me where your greatest strength lies."
Judges 16:16 And when she became troublesome, and tormented him with her words day after day, and wore down his spirit to the point of death,
Judges 16:17 he opened his whole heart to her and said: "A razor has never touched my head, for I am a Nazirite, that is, consecrated to God from my mother's womb. If my head were shaven, my strength would depart from me, and I would become weak and be like any other man."
Judges 16:18 And when Delilah saw that he had opened his whole heart to her, she sent word to the lords of the Philistines and commanded them, saying: "Come up just once more, because now he has revealed his whole heart to me." So they came up, bringing the money with them.
Judges 16:19 And she made him sleep on her lap. While he was in a deep sleep, she had his head shaven of its seven locks. And she began to afflict him and push him away, for his strength had departed from him.
Judges 16:20 And she said: "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" He, roused from sleep, said: "I will go out and shake myself free, just as I have done before." But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him.
Judges 16:21 So the Philistines seized him, and immediately gouged out his eyes, and led him down to Gaza, bound with chains. They put him in prison and made him grind grain.
Judges 16:22 Now his shaven hair had begun to grow back again.
Judges 16:23 Now the lords of the Philistines gathered together to offer magnificent sacrifices to their god Dagon, and to feast, saying: "Our god has delivered our enemy Samson into our hands!"
Judges 16:24 When the citizens saw this, they praised their god, saying the same things: "Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, who devastated our land and killed many of us!"
Judges 16:25 And as they were rejoicing and became even more joyful after the meal, they commanded that Samson be called to entertain them. So they brought him from prison, and he entertained them. Then they made him stand between two pillars.
Judges 16:26 And he said to the boy who was leading him by the hand: "Let me go, so that I may touch the pillars on which the whole house rests, and rest a little while."
Judges 16:27 Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were in that place. There were also about three thousand men and women on the roof, watching Samson entertain.
Judges 16:28 Then, calling upon the Lord, he said: "Lord God, remember me, and restore my former strength to me now, my God, so that I may avenge myself on my enemies, and take one vengeance for the loss of my eyes."
Judges 16:29 And Samson took hold of both pillars on which the whole house rested. He grasped one with his right hand and the other with his left, and he leaned with all his might.
Judges 16:30 And he said: "Let my soul die with the Philistines!" Then, pushing the pillars with great force, the house collapsed upon the lords and upon all the multitude who were there. And he killed many more in his death than he had killed in his life.
Judges 16:31 Then his brothers and all his relatives went down and took his body. They buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the tomb of Manoah his father. And Samson had judged Israel for twenty years.
Judges 17:1 There was a man from the mountains of Ephraim whose name was Micah.
Judges 17:2 He said to his mother: 'The eleven hundred pieces of silver that you stole, and about which you cursed a thief while I heard you—look, I have them. They are with me. I've given them back to you.' To which his mother replied: 'May the Lord bless you, my son.'
Judges 17:3 So he gave back the eleven hundred pieces of silver to her. But his mother said to him: 'I have consecrated and vowed this silver to the Lord with my own hand, so that you may make an idol—both carved and cast—out of it. Now I entrust it to you.'
Judges 17:4 So the mother gave the money back to her son, who then gave it to a craftsman—both a carver and a metalworker—who made from it an idol, both carved and cast. And it was placed in Micah's house.
Judges 17:5 Micah then set up a shrine in his house, which was like a small temple. He also made an ephod and household idols (teraphim). He consecrated one of his sons, and that son became his priest.
Judges 17:6 In those days, there was no king ruling over Israel. Instead, everyone did whatever they thought was right in their own eyes.
Judges 17:7 There was also a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from that tribe's family line. He was a Levite, but was living there as a temporary resident.
Judges 17:8 He traveled away from his city of Bethlehem, and set out to live wherever he could find a place. As he was traveling through the mountains of Ephraim, he came to Micah's house.
Judges 17:9 Micah asked him: 'Where do you come from?' He answered him: 'I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to live wherever I can, and wherever seems suitable to me.'
Judges 17:10 Micah then said: 'Stay with me, and be a father and a priest to me. And I will give you ten pieces of silver each year, two sets of garments, and your food.' So he stayed with him.
Judges 17:11 And the Levite accepted his offer as if he were a son, and held him in high regard.
Judges 17:12 Micah formally consecrated the young man (as a priest), and the young man then served Micah as his priest, living in his house.
Judges 17:13 And Micah said: 'Now I know that the Lord will bless me, because I have a Levite serving as priest.'
Judges 18:1 In those days, no king ruled over the nation of Israel. The tribe of Dan was still looking for a territory to settle in and make their home, because up to that time, they had not yet received their own land among the other tribes as an inheritance.
Judges 18:2 So the descendants of Dan sent five of their bravest men from their kinsmen in Zorah and Eshtaol, so these men could spy out the land and investigate it thoroughly. The leaders of Dan told them, “Go and examine the land.” When these men reached the hill country of Ephraim, and entered the house of a man named Micah, they rested there for a time.
Judges 18:3 While they were near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. So, they turned aside a bit from their path and asked him, “Where are you from?” He replied, “I am from Bethlehem of Judah, and I am a Levite.”
Judges 18:4 Then they asked him, saying, “Please, consult the Lord for us, so we may know if the mission we are on will be successful, and if our plans will turn out as we desire.”
Judges 18:5 The Levite replied to them, “Go in peace. The Lord will make your journey prosperous, and your way will be under His protection.”
Judges 18:6 So the five men continued their journey and arrived at Laish. They saw the people living there securely, following the custom of the Sidonians, carefree and lacking nothing. There was no one to trouble them with any demands, and they were far from Sidon, not intermingling with any other people.
Judges 18:7 When the men returned to their kinsmen in Zorah and Eshtaol, they were asked what they had done. They answered,
Judges 18:8 “Rise up, and let us go up against them. For we have seen a land that is very fertile and spacious beyond measure. Come, let there be no delay! Let us go up and take possession of it, for it will require no difficult work.”
Judges 18:9 God has given us a very fertile land, with very wide territories for our inheritance.”
Judges 18:10 Then the five spies said, “When you go, you will come to a secure people, living in a spacious land. God has given it into your hands—a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”
Judges 18:11 So, from the tribe of Dan, that is, from Zorah and Eshtaol, six hundred men set out, armed with weapons for war.
Judges 18:12 They went up and encamped in Kiriath-jearim of Judah. Because of this, that place was called Mahaneh-dan, meaning 'Camp of Dan,' until the present day. It is located behind Kiriath-jearim.
Judges 18:13 From there, they passed on into the hill country of Ephraim. When they reached Micah’s house,
Judges 18:14 the five men who had previously been sent to spy out the land of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you know that in these houses there is an ephod, and household idols, and a carved image, and a molten image? Consider what you should do.”
Judges 18:15 And when they had turned aside a little, they came to the house of the young Levite, who was in Micah’s house. And they greeted him.
Judges 18:16 Then the six hundred men, as they were armed, stood before the entrance.
Judges 18:17 But the five men who had been the first spies went up, entered Micah’s house, and took the ephod, the household idols, the carved image, and the molten image. Meanwhile, the priest stood by the entrance, along with the six hundred armed men who were prepared for battle.
Judges 18:18 So, they went in and took the ephod, the household idols, the carved image, and the molten image. Then the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
Judges 18:19 They replied to him, “Be silent, and put your hand over your mouth. Come with us and be a father and a priest for us. Which is better for you: to be a priest for the house of just one man, or to be a priest for a whole tribe and a family group in Israel?”
Judges 18:20 And the priest was pleased, so he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image, and went with the Danites, in the middle of the armed crowd.
Judges 18:21 As they proceeded on their way, they made sure their little children, their livestock, and all their valuable possessions went ahead of them for safety.
Judges 18:22 By the time they had moved a little distance from Micah’s house, those who lived in Micah’s house heard that their brothers, the Danites, were carrying off everything they had, along with their priest.
Judges 18:23 So they cried out and pursued the Danites, and when they overtook Micah, they severely rebuked him for what had happened.
Judges 18:24 Micah, responding with a tearful voice, said, “You have taken away my gods, which I made for myself, and you have taken my priest, and all that I have. And yet you ask, ‘What is wrong?’”
Judges 18:25 The men of Dan said to him, “Do not argue with us, and let no one hear you crying out, lest fierce men attack you and you lose your life, and the lives of all your household.”
Judges 18:26 And so, the Danites continued on their journey. When Micah saw that they were stronger than he and his men, he turned back and returned to his house.
Judges 18:27 Meanwhile, the Danites took what Micah had made, and they kept his priest. They then went to Laish, to a people who were at peace and secure. The Danites struck them down with the edge of the sword and burned the entire city with fire.
Judges 18:28 There was no one to help them, because they lived far from Sidon and had no alliance with any other people, either of a city or of the countryside. The place was in a valley that belonged to Beth-rehob. So the Danites built a new city and lived in it.
Judges 18:29 And the city was named Dan, after the name of their ancestor, who was a son of Israel. Previously, the city had been called Laish.
Judges 18:30 And the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image. Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his descendants became priests for the tribe of Dan, serving there until the day of the captivity of the land.
Judges 18:31 So Micah’s idol remained with them for all the days that the house of God was in Shiloh.
Judges 19:1 It happened then in those days, when there was no king in Israel (which signified a time of great moral and social disorder), that a certain Levite man, a sojourner, was living on the side of Mount Ephraim. This Levite took for himself a concubine as a wife from Bethlehem of Judah.
Judges 19:2 She left him, and returned to her father's house in Bethlehem of Judah, and remained with him for four months.
Judges 19:3 So her husband went to her, intending to bring her back by speaking kindly to her, taking with him a servant and two donkeys. She received him and brought him into her father's house. When her father-in-law saw him, he rejoiced at his arrival.
Judges 19:4 And his father-in-law urged him to stay, and he remained with him for three days, eating and drinking and sleeping there together.
Judges 19:5 On the fourth day, as he rose early in the morning, he intended to depart. But his father-in-law said to him: "Refresh your spirits a little with food, and then you may leave."
Judges 19:6 So they sat and ate and drank together. And the girl's father said to her husband: "Please, stay here today and enjoy yourself."
Judges 19:7 But he rose, preparing to leave. And his father-in-law began to restrain him again, so he stayed there overnight once more.
Judges 19:8 Rising early on the fifth day to depart, his father-in-law said to him: "Please, refresh your spirits, and wait a little while until the day passes and it declines towards evening." And they both ate together.
Judges 19:9 When the Levite rose to leave with his concubine-wife and his servant, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him: "Look, the day is already drawing towards its end, and night is approaching. Stay with me today and overnight. Behold, the sun is already setting; spend the night here and enjoy yourself. And tomorrow morning you may depart and go to your own house."
Judges 19:10 He refused. Instead, he immediately set out and came opposite Jebus, which is Jerusalem, having with him two loaded donkeys, and his concubine-wife and his servant.
Judges 19:11 As they were now near Jebus, a great part of the day had passed, and the twilight (the time of gathering darkness) had fallen. And the servant boy said to his master: "Please come, let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and stay in it."
Judges 19:12 His master answered him: "We will not enter the town of this foreign people, who are not from Israel, but we will pass on as far as Gibeah."
Judges 19:13 And he added: "Come, let us pass through to one of the other places, and stay in Gibeah, or in Ramah."
Judges 19:14 So they passed on, and when the sun was already setting, they entered Gibeah, which is in the tribe of Benjamin.
Judges 19:15 When they had entered there, they sat in the city square, and no one was willing to receive them into their house for lodging, so that they might spend the night.
Judges 19:16 And behold, an old man appeared, returning from his work in the fields in the evening. He himself was also from Mount Ephraim and was living as a sojourner in Gibeah. The men of that city, however, were sons of Belial (meaning, utterly wicked and lawless men).
Judges 19:17 And lifting his eyes, he saw the sojourning traveler sitting in the city square, and he said to him: "Where do you come from? And where are you going?"
Judges 19:18 He replied: "We are traveling from Bethlehem of Judah as far as the side of Mount Ephraim, from which place I also come. We went to Bethlehem of Judah, and now we are returning from there, going to my own house. And there is no one who will receive us into his house."
Judges 19:19 "We have hay and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for my use and for your female servant (my concubine-wife), and for the boy who is with you. We lack nothing except hospitality."
Judges 19:20 To him the old man said: "Peace be with you. Whatever you need shall be provided by my care. Only, please, do not remain in the square."
Judges 19:21 And he brought him into his house and provided fodder for the donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they received food.
Judges 19:22 After they were refreshed and cheerful, behold, the men of that city, sons of Belial (wicked men), surrounded the house and began to pound on the doors, shouting to the old master of the house, saying: "Bring out the man who has come into your house, so that we may sexually abuse him."
Judges 19:23 And the old man went out to them and said: "No, my brothers, do not do this evil, for this man has come into my house as my guest. And cease from this depravity."
Judges 19:24 "I have a virgin daughter, and this man has his concubine-wife. I will bring them out, and you may shame them and do to them whatever pleases you. Only, I beg of you, do not commit this wicked act against this man."
Judges 19:25 But they refused to listen and tried to force their way to the man. Seeing this, the man seized his concubine-wife and brought her out to them. They abused her sexually, and throughout the entire night, they violently raped her in turn. And when it was already dawning, they released her.
Judges 19:26 The woman came in the morning and collapsed at the door of the house where her husband was staying, and there she died.
Judges 19:27 And her husband opened the door in the morning, and went out to set out on his journey, and found his concubine-wife lying at the door, with her hands on the threshold.
Judges 19:28 And he said to her: "Get up, and let's go." But she did not answer, for she lay there dead. The man, realizing it was a corpse, took her up and placed her on the donkey, and returned to his house.
Judges 19:29 When he had returned there, he took a knife, and with her bones, he divided his concubine-wife into twelve parts. And he sent these parts into all the territories of Israel.
Judges 19:30 When all who saw this saw it, they said: "Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel since the day our fathers came up out of the land of Egypt, even until the present day. Consider this, men, take counsel, and speak your minds."
Judges 19:1 It happened in those days, when Israel had no king and was ruled by judges, that there was a Levite man, living in the mountainous region of Ephraim. He took a concubine wife from Bethlehem in Judah.
Judges 19:2 His concubine became angry with him and left him, returning to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah. She remained there with him for four months, or even longer.
Judges 19:3 Her husband then rose up and went to her, intending to bring her back by speaking kindly to her, and to take her with him. He had with him a servant and two donkeys. When the woman received him, she led him into her father’s house. When her father saw him, they rejoiced and celebrated his arrival.
Judges 19:4 The father-in-law, the woman's father, kept him for three days. During this time, the Levite ate and drank with him, and stayed at his house. On the fourth day, he rose up in the night, intending to leave.
Judges 19:5 But his father-in-law said to him, "Please, refresh your spirit a little, and taste some bread, and then you may leave."
Judges 19:6 So the Levite sat down, and both he and his father-in-law ate and drank together. Then the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "I beg you, stay here today, and let us enjoy ourselves together."
Judges 19:7 But when the Levite prepared to leave in the morning, his father-in-law urged him, saying, "Refresh your spirit, and stay here until evening." So both of them ate and drank again.
Judges 19:8 The man rose up to leave with his wife and servant. But his father-in-law again said to him, "Please, strengthen yourself, I beg you, and stay here today also. See, the sun is setting, and the day is now turning into darkness. Stay with me, eat and drink, and tomorrow morning when it becomes light, you may leave and go to your home."
Judges 19:9 But he refused. Instead, he immediately continued on his way and departed. He came opposite Jebus, which is Jerusalem, having with him his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.
Judges 19:10 Now they had approached Jebus, and night was upon them. The servant said to his master, "Please come, let us turn aside into the city of the Jebusites and stay there overnight."
Judges 19:11 But his master answered him, "We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners, who are not of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeon."
Judges 19:12 And he added, "Come, let us hurry to one of these cities, and we will stay there, either in Gibeah or in Ramah."
Judges 19:13 So they passed by Jebus and continued on their way. The sun set for them near Gibeah, which is in the tribe of Benjamin.
Judges 19:14 They turned aside to Gibeah to stay there. When they had entered, they sat down in the city square, but no one offered them hospitality.
Judges 19:15 And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the fields in the evening. He, too, was from the mountainous region of Ephraim and was living as a sojourner in Gibeah. But the men of that region were sons of Belial—meaning wicked men—and they were unwilling to receive any guest.
Judges 19:16 Lifting his eyes, the old man saw the traveling man in the city square. He said to him, "Where are you coming from? And where are you going?"
Judges 19:17 The man answered, "I am traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the innermost parts of the mountainous region of Ephraim, which is where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I am returning from there, striving to reach my home. Yet, no one receives me into his house."
Judges 19:18 "We have straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for our own use, and for your female servant and your male servant. We lack nothing, except this one thing: that you take us in as guests."
Judges 19:19 The old man said to him, "Peace be with you. All that you desire, I have at hand. Only, I beg you, do not stay in the city square."
Judges 19:20 So he brought him into his house and gave fodder to his donkeys. The travelers then washed their feet, and they ate and drank.
Judges 19:21 While they were refreshing themselves and feasting, suddenly the men of the city, sons of Belial—meaning lawless men—surrounded the house. They struck the door, crying out to the old master of the house, saying, "Bring out the man who has entered your house, so that we may abuse him."
Judges 19:22 The old man went out to them and said, "No, my brothers, no, I beg you, do not commit this wickedness, because this man has entered my house. Cease from this shameful act."
Judges 19:23 "Here is my virgin daughter, and here is his concubine. I will bring them out to you, so you may humble them and do to them whatever pleases you. Only, I beg you, do not commit this wicked act against the man."
Judges 19:24 But the men would not listen. They continued with their incitement and wanted to humiliate the man by force, having seized his concubine. Seeing this, the man took hold of his concubine and threw her out the door. They took her, abused her all night, and treated her with indignities until morning.
Judges 19:25 And they let her go as the day departed. But the woman, in the morning when it was already growing light, came to the door of the house where her husband was staying, and there she collapsed.
Judges 19:26 And she lay dead before the feet of her husband. He opened the door and went out, intending to prepare for his journey. He found the corpse of his wife lying on the threshold before the house, with her hands spread out over the threshold.
Judges 19:27 Thinking she was resting, he said to her, "Get up and walk." When no one responded, and realizing that she was dead, he lifted her up and placed her on the donkey. Then he returned to his home.
Judges 19:28 When he had entered his house, he seized a knife and cut the corpse of his wife, along with her bones, into twelve pieces. He then sent these pieces into all the borders of Israel.
Judges 19:29 And as such things were carried through each and every region, everyone who saw it cried out, "Nothing like this has ever happened, nor has anything like it been seen, from the day the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt until this present day. Men, consider this matter, consult together, and speak what seems right to you."
Judges 19:30 And it was as if all of them had said with one voice, "Such a terrible and horrifying thing has never happened in Israel!"

Judges 20:1 Then all the sons of Israel went out, from Dan all the way to Beersheba in the south, and from the land of Gilead in the east.
They gathered as one man before the Lord in Mizpah, in a solemn assembly.
Judges 20:2 All the leading men of the people came, and all the tribes of Israel formed an assembly of God's people.
There were four hundred thousand foot soldiers, all experienced men of war.
Judges 20:3 Without delay, even the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.
Judges 20:4 Then the sons of Israel said: "Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?"
Judges 20:5 The Levite, the husband of the dishonored concubine, responded: "I came to Gibeah of the Benjaminites with my concubine so we could stay there for the night.
Judges 20:6 But behold, the men of that city rose up against me.
They intended to burn down my house, to violate my concubine, and to brutally kill her.
Judges 20:7 When I saw that she had been horribly abused throughout the entire night, I finally let her go, dead, at the doorstep of my house.
Judges 20:8 So I took her, and cut her into pieces, and sent her to all the borders of your inheritance throughout Israelite territory.
I did this because no one had even considered what a wicked deed was committed, and no such thing has ever happened in Israel before.
Judges 20:9 Behold, you are all here, sons of Israel.
Decide what you ought to do.
Judges 20:10 Let us take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand.
These men will prepare provisions for the army.
Then the rest of the army will go and strike the city of Gibeah of Benjamin, because they have committed such a disgraceful thing in Israel.
Judges 20:11 So all Israel assembled against the city as one man, with the same mind and purpose.
Judges 20:12 And they sent messengers to all the tribe of Benjamin, saying: "Why has such wickedness been found among you?"
Judges 20:13 Hand over the men of Gibeah, those sons of Belial (a term for worthless and wicked men), who committed this atrocity, so they may die and evil may be removed from Israel."
But the Benjaminites were unwilling to listen to the commands and words of their brothers, the sons of Israel.
Instead, they gathered together from their cities to help the inhabitants of Gibeah.
Judges 20:14 And those counted from the cities of Benjamin who had come armed for battle were twenty-six thousand men.
This number did not include the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were seven hundred very strong men.
Judges 20:15 From all these people, there were six hundred chosen men who used both hands as if they were their right hand (meaning they were ambidextrous or extremely skilled).
They hurled stones with slings so precisely that not a single one would miss its target.
Judges 20:16 Apart from these, there were also found among the men of Israel four hundred thousand fighting men, that is, warriors, who were all ready for battle.
Judges 20:17 These were the ones who had gathered in one place.
Judges 20:18 Then the sons of Israel came and consulted the Lord, saying: "Who among us shall go up first to battle against the sons of Benjamin?"
To them the Lord responded: "Judah will go up first."
Judges 20:19 Immediately the sons of Israel rose early in the morning and encamped near Gibeah.
Judges 20:20 And going out from there to battle against Benjamin, they arrayed themselves for battle against them near Gibeah.
Judges 20:21 And the sons of Benjamin came out from Gibeah and on that day killed twenty-two thousand men of the sons of Israel.
Judges 20:22 Again, the sons of Israel, trusting in the Lord their God and in their own might and courage, arrayed their battle line in the same place where they had fought before.
Judges 20:23 And they went up and wept before the Lord until evening.
They consulted Him, saying: "Should I go up again to battle against the sons of Benjamin, my brothers, or not?"
To them He responded: "Go up against them."
Judges 20:24 And when the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the next day, they fought.
Judges 20:25 And Benjamin came out from the gates of Gibeah, and again offered them battle.
They killed eighteen thousand men of Israel, all of them fighting men.
Judges 20:26 Therefore all the sons of Israel went up to the city of Bethel.
They wept before the Lord, sitting there until evening, and they afflicted themselves with fasting on that day.
They offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Him.
Judges 20:27 And they inquired of Him concerning their deliverance and welfare.
In those days, the Ark of the Covenant of God was in Bethel,
Judges 20:28 and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was in charge of the house of God (the sanctuary).
And they consulted the Lord and said: "Should we go out again to battle against Benjamin our brothers, or should we stop?"
The Lord said to them: "Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hands."
Judges 20:29 So the sons of Israel rose up on the next day and went against Gibeah, and surrounded it.
Judges 20:30 And for a third time, they arrayed their battle lines against Benjamin, in their divisions, just as before.
Judges 20:31 But the sons of Benjamin boldly came out of the city and arrayed themselves to meet them.
They began to wound and kill some of the people, just as on the first and second days.
These were those who were fleeing from all the cities, and going along the highway and through various places, so that they killed about thirty men.
Judges 20:32 The Benjaminites hoped that they would rout them as before.
But while the Israelites pretended to flee, the Benjaminites, pursuing them, were drawing some away from the highway towards the city, and others into the fields.
Judges 20:33 But the sons of Israel gathered all their forces together at the place called Baal-tamar.
And their ambush was gradually revealing itself from its hiding places, that is, from the hidden area of Gibeah.
Judges 20:34 So ten thousand chosen warriors from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle began to rage fiercely.
But Benjamin did not understand that destruction was imminent for them.
Judges 20:35 And the Lord struck Benjamin down before the sons of Israel.
On that day, they killed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin, all of them fighting men.
Judges 20:36 For the sons of Benjamin realized that the sons of Israel, by turning in flight from them, were making way for the ambush which Israel had set.
Judges 20:37 Then those who were in ambush suddenly rushed upon Gibeah, and spread out as they passed through.
They killed everyone in the city with swords.
Judges 20:38 Now the signal given by the army of Israel was that after they had captured the city, they would set it on fire, so that it would burn high up into the sky and indicate their impending victory.
Judges 20:39 And when the sons of Israel were already engaged in battle, Benjamin also began to see that smoke was rising from the city.
They now clearly knew the disaster that had previously been hidden from them.
Judges 20:40 And indeed, those who had feigned flight, seeing this, resisted Benjamin more strongly.
The Benjaminites, terrified, began to flee towards the city, but this did not help them.
Nor could they escape from being killed by those who had already captured the city.
Judges 20:1 Therefore, all the children of Israel came out from Baala, and they gathered as one unified man, from Dan to Beersheba, and even from the land of Gilead, before the Lord in Mizpah.
Judges 20:2 And all the chiefs of the Israelite tribes, and the tribes themselves, stood in the assembly of God's people. There were four hundred thousand armed foot soldiers, ready for battle.
Judges 20:3 Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.
Judges 20:4 And immediately, the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, spoke: 'This is an abominable thing,' he said, 'and an execrable crime that has been perpetrated in Israel. My concubine and I were in Gibeah, which is in the tribe of Benjamin, to spend the night. And behold, the men of that city surrounded us, intending to kill me, and they violently killed my concubine, so that she died.'
Judges 20:5 They burst into my home, seized my concubine, and violently abused her until she died.
Judges 20:6 Therefore, I divided her dead body into twelve parts and sent them into all the borders of Israel, so that the atrocity and the unspeakable evil committed in Israel would become known to everyone.
Judges 20:7 Now, behold, all of you, children of Israel, discern what you ought to do about this.
Judges 20:8 And all the people rose up as one unified man, saying: 'We will not go to our tents, nor will any of us return to his home.'
Judges 20:9 'But this is the plan that we ought to take now against Gibeah:'
Judges 20:10 'Let ten men be chosen out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to bring provisions for the army. Then the fighters can inflict upon Gibeah of Benjamin what it deserves.'
Judges 20:11 So, all the men of Israel assembled against the city as one unified man, and with one mind.
Judges 20:12 And they sent messengers to the entire tribe of Benjamin, to say: 'Why has such a great crime been perpetrated among you?'
Judges 20:13 'Hand over the men of Gibeah who committed this vile deed and crime, so that they may die, and evil may be removed from Israel.' But the sons of Benjamin were unwilling to listen to the words of their Israelite brothers.
Judges 20:14 Instead, they gathered from all their cities into one place, and together they resolved to come out against those attacking them.
Judges 20:15 There were twenty-five thousand armed fighters from the tribe of Benjamin, besides the seven hundred very strong men who were inhabitants of Gibeah.
Judges 20:16 Among all those gathered, there were seven hundred very strong men who could fight with either hand as well as with their right, and they could accurately hurl stones with slings, able to strike a single hair without missing.
Judges 20:17 From the rest of Israel also, apart from the children of Benjamin, there were four hundred thousand armed fighters, all of them men of war.
Judges 20:18 They rose up and came to the house of God, that is, to Bethel, and consulted Him, saying: 'Who among our army should go up first to battle against the sons of Benjamin?' The Lord answered: 'Judah will go up first.'
Judges 20:19 And immediately they rose up in the night and encamped near Gibeah.
Judges 20:20 And when the army of Israel had arrayed itself against Benjamin, they began the battle against them.
Judges 20:21 And the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and killed eighteen thousand very strong men from the children of Israel.
Judges 20:22 From this, the children of Israel gathered courage again, resolving to fight in the same place where they had first engaged in battle.
Judges 20:23 And they went up and wept before the Lord until night, and consulted Him, saying: 'Should we proceed further to battle against our brothers, the sons of Benjamin, or should we stop?' To them He responded: 'Go up against them.'
Judges 20:24 And when they had advanced on the second morning, to battle against the sons of Benjamin,
Judges 20:25 the sons of Benjamin came out from the gates of Gibeah and killed eighteen thousand more very strong, armed men from the children of Israel who were ready for battle.
Judges 20:26 Because of this, all the children of Israel came to the house of God, and sitting there, they wept before the Lord. They fasted on that day until evening and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to Him.
Judges 20:27 And they consulted the Lord in those days, for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord was there.
Judges 20:28 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it. And they inquired: 'Should we proceed further to battle against our brothers, the sons of Benjamin, or should we stop?' The Lord said: 'Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hands.'
Judges 20:29 Therefore, the children of Israel set ambushes all around the city of Gibeah.
Judges 20:30 And when the battle had been joined against Benjamin for the third time, just as it had been once and twice before,
Judges 20:31 and the Benjaminites had come out of the city, taking their usual route, they pursued those fleeing and killed about thirty men, just as before. The Israelites thought they were defeated, and Benjamin could now escape from their hands.
Judges 20:32 However, those who were hidden in ambush in the nearby places around Gibeah, when they saw the Israelites fleeing toward Gibeah, and the Benjaminites fighting in the same way they themselves were fleeing, said: 'Let us flee, and not pursue any further, lest we be wounded in the same place as them.'
Judges 20:33 But those who had been in ambush, when they saw the Benjaminites were actually defeated (and retreating into the trap), rushed upon them from behind and killed twenty-five thousand of their men.
Judges 20:34 And when they had come out from Gibeah for battle, they began to kill from among them up to seven hundred men.
Judges 20:35 And the Lord delivered Benjamin into the hands of Israel on that day. And they killed twenty-five thousand one hundred men from them, all of whom were warriors.
Judges 20:36 For the children of Israel had given ground to Benjamin, and the Benjaminites thought they had won. But those who were hidden in ambush, the messengers and warriors, had concealed themselves around Gibeah, and all were ready for the fight.
Judges 20:37 And when the children of Israel went away as if defeated, and Benjamin pursued them in their flight (for all those who were fleeing had retreated to Gibeah), those who were in the hidden places near Gibeah rushed upon them and began to kill them.
Judges 20:38 And it came to pass that, while they were pursuing the fleeing Israelites, those who were in ambush raised a signal from their hidden positions, so that the fleeing Israelites would know that the whole city was now in their power.
Judges 20:39 And they came out and occupied the city, and they killed all who were in it with the edge of the sword.
Judges 20:40 And when Benjamin saw the city occupied, and the fires from the city were now ascending into the sky, they understood that they were defeated.
Judges 21:1 The sons of Israel had also sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, "None of us will give his daughter in marriage to a man from the tribe of Benjamin."
Judges 21:2 And all the people came to the House of God at Shiloh, and remained there until evening before the Lord, and they raised their voices and began to wail with great weeping, saying:
Judges 21:3 Why, O Lord, God of Israel, has this evil happened to Your people, that one tribe should be cut off from Israel?
Judges 21:4 The next day, rising early, they built an altar there, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings.
Judges 21:5 And they said, "Who is there from all the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the Lord at Mizpah?" For they had bound themselves with a solemn oath to kill those who had not come up.
Judges 21:6 And they grieved over their brother Benjamin, and said, "One tribe has been destroyed from Israel!"
Judges 21:7 From where will they find wives? For we all swore a common oath that we would not give our daughters to them.
Judges 21:8 Therefore they said, "Who is there from all the tribes of Israel who did not come up to the Lord at Mizpah?" And behold, it was found that the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead had not come to that place.
Judges 21:9 At that time, when the Israelites were in Shiloh, none of the people from Jabesh-Gilead had been found among them.
Judges 21:10 So the sons of Israel sent there ten thousand of their strongest men, and gave them this command: "Go and strike down the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead with the edge of the sword, both their wives and their little children."
Judges 21:11 And this is what you must observe: Every male, and every woman who has known a man, you are to kill; but save the virgins alive to become wives for Benjamin.
Judges 21:12 And from Jabesh-Gilead, four hundred virgins were found who had not known a man's bed, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, in the land of Canaan.
Judges 21:13 And they sent messengers to the sons of Benjamin, who were in the rock of Rimmon, and promised them peace.
Judges 21:14 So the sons of Benjamin came at that time, and wives were given to them from the women of Jabesh-Gilead who had been saved; but no more wives were found to be given to the remaining men, as there weren't enough.
Judges 21:15 And all the sons of Israel grieved over Benjamin, because the Lord had allowed one tribe to be diminished from His people.
Judges 21:16 And the elders said, "What shall we do about the rest of the men who have not received wives? For all the women of Benjamin were killed."
Judges 21:17 And they held this opinion: "Let Benjamin endure, and let one tribe remain in Israel, so that it may not be utterly destroyed."
Judges 21:18 But we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for we are bound by this oath: 'Cursed be he who gives a wife from his daughters to Benjamin.'
Judges 21:19 And they remembered the solemn festival of the Lord, which was celebrated every year in Shiloh. This city is located north of Bethel, on the east side of the road leading from Bethel to Shechem, and south of the town of Lebonah.
Judges 21:20 And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, "Go and hide yourselves in the vineyards."
Judges 21:21 And when you see the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then suddenly come out from the vineyards, and each of you seize a wife for yourselves from the daughters of Shiloh, and then go to the land of Benjamin.
Judges 21:22 And when their fathers and their brothers come and begin to complain to us, we will say to them: 'Forgive them, for these men did not take them by right of war or as spoils of victory. Rather, you implicitly gave them to them when we begged on their behalf. Therefore, you are free from the guilt of your oath of not giving your daughters.'
Judges 21:23 So the sons of Benjamin did as they had been instructed: and according to their number, each man seized a wife for himself from those who were accustomed to perform the dances. Then they went into their own possession, and built up cities, and lived in them.
Judges 21:24 And so, at that time, each of the sons of Israel returned to his own tribe and family, and they went out from that place, each to his own tent.
Judges 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel; but each man did what seemed right in his own eyes, leading to chaos and ungodly acts.
Ruth 1:1 During the time when the judges ruled the land, there was a great famine in the land of Israel. So, a man from Bethlehem in Judah left his home to live as a foreigner in the country of Moab, along with his wife and his two sons.
Ruth 1:2 The man’s name was Elimelech, and his wife’s name was Naomi. They had two sons, one named Mahlon and the other Chilion. They were Ephrathites, from Bethlehem in Judah.
Ruth 1:3 Naomi’s husband, Elimelech, died there in Moab. So, she was left with her two sons.
Ruth 1:4 Her sons took wives from among the Moabite women. One wife was named Orpah, and the other was named Ruth. They lived in Moab for about ten years.
Ruth 1:5 Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died. So, Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband, completely alone.
Ruth 1:6 Naomi then decided to return from the country of Moab to her homeland, along with her two daughters-in-law. She had heard that the Lord God had visited His people in Judah and had given them food.
Ruth 1:7 So, she and her two daughters-in-law set out from the place where they had been living as foreigners. They were already on their way back to the land of Judah.
Ruth 1:8 Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, 'Go, return each of you to your mother’s house. May the Lord God deal kindly with you, just as you have dealt kindly with your dead husbands and with me.'
Ruth 1:9 'May the Lord God grant each of you rest and peace in the home of a future husband whom you will marry.' Then she kissed them goodbye, and they began to weep loudly.
Ruth 1:10 They said to her, 'No, we will go with you to your people.'
Ruth 1:11 But Naomi answered them, 'Turn back, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Do I still have sons in my womb who could become your husbands?'
Ruth 1:12 'Go back, my daughters, go your way. For I am too old to have a husband. Even if I were to say, “I have hope,” even if I were to become pregnant tonight and give birth to sons—'
Ruth 1:13 'would you wait until they grew up? Would you refrain from marrying for them? No, my daughters, please don’t. For my distress is far greater than yours, because the Lord has turned against me.'
Ruth 1:14 Again, they wept loudly. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye and returned to her own people. But Ruth clung to Naomi.
Ruth 1:15 Then Naomi said to Ruth, 'Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her own people and to her gods. You should go back with her.'
Ruth 1:16 But Ruth replied, 'Do not urge me to leave you or to turn back from following you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live. Your people shall be my people, and your God shall be my God.'
Ruth 1:17 'Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord God do to me and more also, if anything but death separates you and me.'
Ruth 1:18 When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped arguing with her or trying to persuade her otherwise.
Ruth 1:19 So, the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in the city, the entire city was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, 'Can this be Naomi?'
Ruth 1:20 She replied to them, 'Do not call me Naomi, which means 'pleasant.' Instead, call me Mara, which means 'bitter.' For the Almighty God has filled me with much bitterness and sorrow.'
Ruth 1:21 'I went out from here full, but the Lord God has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, when the Lord God has humbled me, and the Almighty God has brought calamity upon me?'
Ruth 1:22 So Naomi returned with her daughter-in-law Ruth, the Moabitess, from the country of Moab. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
Ruth 2:1 Now Naomi had a relative of her husband, a man of great influence and noble lineage, from the family of Elimelech, named Boaz. This man possessed significant wealth and social standing.
Ruth 2:2 And Ruth, the Moabite woman, said to her mother-in-law, "If you permit it, I will go into a field and gather the fallen grain that the reapers leave behind, wherever I may find favor with a landowner." To this Naomi responded, "Go, my daughter." This act of gleaning was a provision for the poor.
Ruth 2:3 So she went out, and coming to a field, she gathered the grain behind the reapers. It just so happened that the field belonged to the man named Boaz, who was from the family of Elimelech. This was truly providential.
Ruth 2:4 And behold, Boaz himself was coming from Bethlehem. He said to the reapers, "The Lord be with you." And they responded to him, "May the Lord bless you." This exchange showed the respectful and pious nature of their community.
Ruth 2:5 Then Boaz said to the young man who was in charge of the reapers, "Whose young woman is this?" He noticed her as a stranger in his field.
Ruth 2:6 To whom the young man responded, "This is the young Moabite woman who came with Naomi from the region of Moab." Her foreign origin was known.
Ruth 2:7 "And she asked to gather the grain behind the reapers' footsteps, and to glean among the gathered sheaves. And since we came here, until now, she has diligently persevered in the field, and she has not even returned home for a moment." This demonstrated Ruth's exceptional work ethic.
Ruth 2:8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen, my daughter, do not go into another field to gather grain, nor depart from this place. Instead, stay close to my young women." This was a direct offer of protection and special privilege.
Ruth 2:9 "And wherever my reapers have finished, follow after them. For I have commanded my young men not to bother you. Rather, when you are thirsty, go to the water vessels and drink from the water from which my young men also drink." Boaz extended hospitality beyond mere permission.
Ruth 2:10 She, falling on her face and prostrating herself on the ground, said, "How have I deserved this, that I should find such favor in your eyes, I who am a mere foreigner?" Ruth's humility was evident.
Ruth 2:11 To whom Boaz responded, "All things have been reported to me: what you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your husband, and how you left your parents and your native land, and came to a people whom you did not know before." Boaz was aware of her virtuous actions.
Ruth 2:12 "May the Lord repay you for your work, and may you receive a full reward from the Lord God of Israel, to whom you have come and under whose protective wings you have taken refuge." Boaz's blessing recognized her conversion to the God of Israel.
Ruth 2:13 And she said, "I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to the heart of your handmaid, though I am not even like one of your own servants." She felt unworthy of such generosity.
Ruth 2:14 And Boaz said to her, "When it is time for the midday meal, come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar." So she sat beside the reapers, and he offered her bread, and she ate and was satisfied, and took some of the leftovers to save for later.
Ruth 2:15 And she rose up to continue gleaning. Boaz then commanded his young men, saying, "Even if she wishes to glean among the sheaves already gathered, do not hinder her." This was an extraordinary allowance for a gleaner.
Ruth 2:16 "But rather, from your own gathered sheaves, intentionally throw out some grain and leave it for her, so that she may collect it without any shame, and no one should rebuke her." This made her task easier and more dignified.
Ruth 2:17 So she gleaned in the field until evening. And she beat out the grain she had gathered to separate it from the stalks, and she found it amounted to about an ephah of barley. This was a substantial amount, thanks to Boaz's generosity.
Ruth 2:18 And carrying what she had collected, she returned to the city and showed it to her mother-in-law. Moreover, she brought forth and gave Naomi some of the leftover food with which she herself had been satisfied earlier. Ruth's constant care for Naomi was clear.
Ruth 2:19 And her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you glean today, and where did you do your work? Blessed be he who had mercy on you." She told Naomi where she had worked, and she said the name of the man under whom she had worked was Boaz.
Ruth 2:20 To whom Naomi responded, "May he be blessed by the Lord, because he has shown the same kindness, as before, now also to the living and to the dead." Naomi was referring to the potential preservation of their family line. And she added, "The man is our close relative, and from our family." This revealed Boaz's role as a potential kinsman-redeemer.
Ruth 2:21 And Ruth said, "Furthermore, he also commanded me this: that I should stay close to his reapers until all the harvest is completely finished." Boaz's protection and provision were ongoing.
Ruth 2:22 To whom her mother-in-law said, "It is better, my daughter, that you go out to glean with his young women, lest you suffer any trouble or harassment in another field." Naomi wisely advised Ruth to remain under Boaz's protection.
Ruth 2:23 So she remained with the young women of Boaz and gleaned until both the barley harvest and the wheat harvest were finished. Ruth obediently continued her work, patiently awaiting God's plan.
Ruth 3:1 Then Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, "My daughter, shouldn't I find you a safe place to settle down, and provide for you?"
Ruth 3:2 "Look, Boaz, with whom you worked in the field, he is a relative of ours, and tonight he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor."
Ruth 3:3 "So, wash yourself, anoint yourself with oil, and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. Do not let any man see you until he has finished eating and drinking."
Ruth 3:4 "When he lies down to sleep, observe the place where he sleeps. Then go and uncover the covering at his feet, and lie down there. And he will then take action regarding your situation, and he will then depart."
Ruth 3:5 Ruth replied, "Whatever you command me, I will do."
Ruth 3:6 So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had commanded her.
Ruth 3:7 When Boaz had eaten and drunk and was in good spirits, and had gone to lie down at the edge of the threshing floor, Ruth came secretly. She uncovered the covering at his feet and lay down there to sleep.
Ruth 3:8 And it happened in the middle of the night: the man was startled and became agitated, and he saw a woman lying at his feet.
Ruth 3:9 And he said to her, "Who are you?" She answered, "I am Ruth, your handmaid. Spread the corner of your cloak over your handmaid, for you are a near kinsman and have the right to redeem me."
Ruth 3:10 He said, "Blessed are you by the Lord, my daughter! This latter kindness you have shown is even greater than the former, because you have not pursued young men, whether poor or rich."
Ruth 3:11 "Do not fear, therefore; whatever you ask of me, I will do for you. For all the people who dwell in the gate of my city know that you are a virtuous woman."
Ruth 3:12 "And I do not wish to hinder this plan, for there is a kinsman nearer than I who has the first right of redemption."
Ruth 3:13 "Stay here tonight, and when morning comes, if he wishes to take you as his wife, it is well. But if he does not wish to take you, I will certainly take you, as the Lord lives! Sleep here until morning."
Ruth 3:14 So she slept at his feet until near daybreak, and rose before people could recognize one another. And Boaz said, "Be careful that no one knows you came here."
Ruth 3:15 And again he said, "Spread out your shawl with which you are covered, and hold it with both hands." When she had spread it out and held it, he measured out six measures of barley and placed it upon her. And she then went into the city.
Ruth 3:16 And she came to her mother-in-law, who said to her, "How did you fare, my daughter?" And she told her everything the man had done for her.
Ruth 3:17 And she said, "He gave me these six measures of barley, and he said, 'Do not return empty-handed to your mother-in-law.'"
Ruth 3:18 Then Naomi said, "Wait, my daughter, until we see what outcome this matter will have. For the man will not rest until he has completed his word and settled the business today."

Ruth 4:1 So Boaz went up to the city gate, which was where all legal and social matters were decided, and he sat there. When he saw the close relative—the one he had spoken about concerning the land and Ruth—passing by, he called out to him by name and said, "Step aside for a moment, and sit down here with me." So the kinsman turned aside from the path and sat down with Boaz.
Ruth 4:2 Boaz then gathered ten men from among the elders of the city—these were the necessary witnesses for legal transactions—and said to them, "Please sit down here."
Ruth 4:3 Once they were all seated, Boaz spoke to the close relative, explaining the situation: "Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, is selling the portion of the field that belonged to our relative Elimelech."
Ruth 4:4 "I thought it was necessary to tell you this now, and to inform you in the presence of all these sitting here, especially the elders of the city. If you wish to redeem the property by your right as a close relative, then buy it and take possession of it. But if you do not wish to redeem it, then you must let me know so that I can proceed, because I am the next in line to you to exercise the right of a close relative to redeem the land. Therefore, there is no other person besides you who has the right of redemption, and I am next after you." The kinsman immediately responded, "I will redeem it."
Ruth 4:5 Boaz then explained, "When you buy the field from Naomi, you must also take Ruth the Moabitess as your wife, she who was the wife of the deceased. This is to ensure that the name of the deceased man is continued in his inheritance and does not perish."
Ruth 4:6 The kinsman replied, "I must surrender my right of redemption. I cannot protect this inheritance for myself without causing harm to my own estate; I would risk the future of my own firstborn son. So, you must use my privilege, which I know I am unable to use myself."
Ruth 4:7 Now, this was the established custom in Israel among close relatives when someone surrendered their right of redemption, in order that a transfer of property would be confirmed and legally binding: a man would take off his sandal and give it to his neighbor. This act served as a clear testimony of the surrender of rights in Israel.
Ruth 4:8 So Boaz said to the close relative, "Then take off your sandal, as is the custom." And immediately, the kinsman took it off his foot.
Ruth 4:9 Then Boaz solemnly declared to the elders and to all the people present, "You are all witnesses today that I have acquired everything that belonged to Elimelech, and everything that belonged to Chilion and Mahlon, all of it from the hand of Naomi."
Ruth 4:10 "And I have also taken Ruth the Moabitess, who was the wife of Mahlon, to be my own wife. My purpose in doing this is to perpetuate the name of the deceased within his inheritance, so that his name will not be cut off from among his relatives, nor from the register at the gate of his hometown. I declare to you that you are indeed witnesses of this matter."
Ruth 4:11 All the people who were sitting in the city gate, along with the elders, responded, "We are indeed witnesses! May the Lord make your wife, Ruth, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the entire household of Israel. May you yourself become an example of strength and prosperity in Ephrathah, and may your name become celebrated and famous in Bethlehem."
Ruth 4:12 "May your household become like the household of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the Lord will grant to you from this young woman, Ruth."
Ruth 4:13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. He then went in to her, and the Lord granted her the grace to conceive and to bear a son.
Ruth 4:14 Then the women of Bethlehem said to Naomi, "Praised be the Lord, who has not left you without a close relative today, so that his name may be celebrated and remembered in Israel! May this child be to you a full redemption and a comfort, and may his own name be cherished."
Ruth 4:15 "May this child bring comfort to your soul and sustain you in your old age, for he has been born to your daughter-in-law, who deeply loves you. She is far better to you than if you had seven sons, for her loyalty and love surpass all."
Ruth 4:16 Naomi then took the child herself, placing him in her lap, and she became his nurse and caretaker, tending to him as her own.
Ruth 4:17 The neighbors and relatives, filled with joy and congratulating her, declared, "A son has been born to Naomi!" And they gave him the name Obed. This Obed later became the father of Jesse, who in turn was the father of David, the great king.
Ruth 4:18 Now, these are the generations descending from Perez: Perez begat Hezron.
Ruth 4:19 Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab.
Ruth 4:20 Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon.
Ruth 4:21 Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed.
Ruth 4:22 Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
1 Samuel 1:1 There was a certain man from Ramathaim Sophim, from the mountain region of Ephraim. His name was Elcana, a son of Jeroham, who was a son of Eliu, who was a son of Thohu, who was a son of Suph—he was an Ephratite.
1 Samuel 1:2 He had two wives: the name of one was Anna, and the name of the second was Phenenna. Phenenna had children, but Anna had no children.
1 Samuel 1:3 And this man would go up from his city at the appointed times each year to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. Heli’s two sons, Ophni and Phinees, were serving there as priests of the Lord.
1 Samuel 1:4 Whenever the day came for the sacrifice, Elcana would make his offering. He would give portions to his wife Phenenna, and to all her sons and daughters.
1 Samuel 1:5 But to Anna, he gave only one portion, and he was sorrowful, for Anna had no children. The Lord had closed her womb, so she could not conceive.
1 Samuel 1:6 Her rival wife, Phenenna, also tormented her and greatly distressed her, constantly taunting Anna over the fact that the Lord had closed her womb.
1 Samuel 1:7 And she did this year after year, whenever they went up to the temple of the Lord. Phenenna would provoke Anna, and Anna would weep and refuse to eat.
1 Samuel 1:8 Then Elcana, her husband, said to her: “Anna, why are you weeping? And why are you not eating? And why is your heart so sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons would be?”
1 Samuel 1:9 So Anna rose up after they had eaten and drunk in Silo. Heli the priest was sitting on a seat by the doorposts of the Lord’s temple.
1 Samuel 1:10 Anna was in deep bitterness of soul. She prayed to the Lord, weeping profusely.
1 Samuel 1:11 And she made a solemn vow, saying: “Lord of hosts, if You would only look upon the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, and grant your handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life. And no razor will ever come upon his head—meaning he will be dedicated to You as a Nazirite.”
1 Samuel 1:12 It so happened that as she continued to multiply her prayers before the Lord, Heli observed her mouth.
1 Samuel 1:13 Now, Anna was speaking in her heart; only her lips were moving, but her voice could not be heard. So Heli thought she was drunk.
1 Samuel 1:14 And he said to her: “How long will you be drunk? Sober up from your wine for a little while, which has made you intoxicated.”
1 Samuel 1:15 Anna answered and said: “No, my lord, I am a woman with a deeply troubled spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor anything that could make me drunk; instead, I have poured out my very soul before the Lord.”
1 Samuel 1:16 Do not consider your handmaid to be one of the daughters of Belial—a worthless or wicked woman. For it is out of the abundance of my great sorrow and grief that I have spoken until now.”
1 Samuel 1:17 Then Heli answered and said: “Go in peace. And may the God of Israel grant you your petition, which you have asked from Him.”
1 Samuel 1:18 And she said: “May your handmaid find favor in your eyes.” Then the woman went on her way, and she ate, and her countenance was no longer downcast or troubled.
1 Samuel 1:19 They rose up early in the morning and worshipped before the Lord. Then they returned and came to their home in Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife, and the Lord remembered her by granting her request.
1 Samuel 1:20 And so it was that after the passage of some days, Anna conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, because she had asked for him from the Lord.
1 Samuel 1:21 Then Elcana, along with all his household, went up to offer to the Lord his annual sacrifice and his solemn vow.
1 Samuel 1:22 But Anna did not go up. Instead, she said to her husband: “I will not go until the child is weaned. Then I will bring him, and he will appear before the presence of the Lord, and he will remain there permanently.”
1 Samuel 1:23 And Elcana, her husband, said to her: “Do what seems good to you. Stay here until you wean him, provided only that the Lord may fulfill His word concerning the child’s dedication.” So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.
1 Samuel 1:24 And after she had weaned him, she brought him up with her, along with three young bullocks, three measures of flour, and a jar of wine. She brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. The boy was still very young.
1 Samuel 1:25 And they sacrificed a bullock, and they brought the boy to Heli.
1 Samuel 1:26 And Anna said: “I beg you, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord—I am that very woman who stood here before you, praying to the Lord.”
1 Samuel 1:27 “It was for this very boy that I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition which I asked from Him.”
1 Samuel 1:28 “Therefore, I have also entrusted him to the Lord for all the days of his life, that he may remain dedicated to the Lord.” And they worshipped the Lord there.
1 Samuel 1:1 There was a man from Ramathaim-Zophim, in the hill country of Ephraim. His name was Elcana, and he was the son of Jeroham, son of Eliu, son of Thohu, son of Suph, an Ephraimite.
1 Samuel 1:2 He had two wives: one was named Anna, and the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children, but Anna had no children.
1 Samuel 1:3 That man would go up from his city each year at the appointed times to worship and offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. Now, the two sons of Eli, Ophni and Phinees, were serving there as priests of the Lord.
1 Samuel 1:4 So when the day came for Elcana to offer the sacrifice, he gave portions of the meat to Phenenna, his wife, and to all her sons and daughters.
1 Samuel 1:5 But to Anna, he gave a special portion, though his heart was heavy, because Anna had no son, for the Lord had closed her womb.
1 Samuel 1:6 Her rival, Phenenna, also tormented and greatly distressed her constantly because the Lord had closed Anna's womb and she had no children.
1 Samuel 1:7 This continued year after year; whenever they went up to the house of the Lord, Phenenna would provoke her. So Anna would weep and refuse to eat anything.
1 Samuel 1:8 Then Elcana, her husband, said to her, 'Anna, why are you weeping? Why do you refuse to eat? And why is your spirit so downcast? Am I not better to you than ten sons?'
1 Samuel 1:9 After they had finished eating and drinking in Silo, Anna stood up. Now Eli, the priest, was sitting on his chair by the doorposts of the Lord's house.
1 Samuel 1:10 With a bitter and heavy spirit, Anna prayed to the Lord, weeping profusely.
1 Samuel 1:11 And she made a solemn vow, saying, 'O Lord of hosts, if You would truly look upon the affliction of Your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Your handmaid, but grant Your handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever touch his head—a commitment to a Nazirite vow.'
1 Samuel 1:12 As Anna continued to pray at great length before the Lord, Eli was observing her mouth.
1 Samuel 1:13 Anna was praying silently within her heart; only her lips were moving, and her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.
1 Samuel 1:14 And Eli said to her, 'How long will you be drunk? Put away the wine and sober up!'
1 Samuel 1:15 Anna answered, 'No, my lord, I am not drunk. I am a woman with a deeply sorrowful spirit. I have drunk no wine or strong drink, but I have poured out my heart before the Lord in prayer.'
1 Samuel 1:16 Do not take your handmaid for a worthless woman, for it is out of the depth of my great pain and sorrow that I have been speaking up to now.
1 Samuel 1:17 Then Eli answered, 'Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you the request you have made of Him.'
1 Samuel 1:18 And Anna said, 'May your handmaid find favor in your sight.' Then the woman went her way, and she ate, and her face was no longer sad.
1 Samuel 1:19 They rose early in the morning, worshipped before the Lord, then returned and came to their home in Ramatha. And Elcana was intimate with his wife, Anna, and the Lord remembered her prayer.
1 Samuel 1:20 And when the time came around, Anna conceived and bore a son. She named him Samuel, saying, 'Because I asked the Lord for him.'
1 Samuel 1:21 Then Elcana, her husband, went up with his entire household to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfill his vow.
1 Samuel 1:22 But Anna did not go up. Instead, she said to her husband, 'I will wait until the child is weaned. Then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the Lord and remain there in His house always.'
1 Samuel 1:23 Elcana, her husband, said to her, 'Do what seems best to you. Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish His word concerning our son.' So the woman stayed home and nursed her son until she weaned him.
1 Samuel 1:24 When she had weaned him, she brought him up to Silo, taking with her three calves, three measures of flour, and a jar of wine, as offerings. She brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. The child was still very young.
1 Samuel 1:25 Then they sacrificed one of the calves, and Anna brought the child to Eli.
1 Samuel 1:26 And Anna said, 'Oh, my lord! As surely as you live, my lord, I am the very woman who stood here beside you, praying to the Lord.'
1 Samuel 1:27 It was for this child that I prayed, and the Lord has granted me the request I made of Him.
1 Samuel 1:28 Therefore, I have dedicated him to the Lord; for as long as he lives, he is dedicated to the Lord.' And they worshipped the Lord there.
1 Samuel 2:1 My heart has leapt with joy in the Lord God, and my strength—my horn—has been raised up in my God. My mouth is now opened wide to speak confidently against my enemies, because I have rejoiced greatly in your saving power.
1 Samuel 2:2 No one is holy like the Lord God; indeed, there is no one else beside you, and no one is strong like our God.
1 Samuel 2:3 Do not speak proudly with multiplied boastings; let your former arrogance cease from your mouth. For the Lord God is the God who knows everything, and all thoughts are prepared before Him.
1 Samuel 2:4 The bow of the mighty has been overcome, but the weak have been girded with strength.
1 Samuel 2:5 Those who were barren before have given birth to many children, and she who had many children has become weak.
1 Samuel 2:6 The Lord God brings death and brings life; He leads down to the realm of the dead and brings back up from it.
1 Samuel 2:7 The Lord God makes one poor and makes one rich; He humbles and He exalts.
1 Samuel 2:8 He lifts up the needy from the dust of the ground, and raises the poor from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a throne of glory.
1 Samuel 2:9 For the pillars of the earth belong to the Lord God, and upon them He has set the world.
1 Samuel 2:10 He will guard the steps of His faithful ones, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. For no man will be strong through his own power.
1 Samuel 2:11 The Lord God will thunder from the heavens against him; the Lord God will judge the ends of the earth, and He will give dominion to His king, and exalt the power—the horn—of His Anointed One.
1 Samuel 2:12 And Elcana went to Ramatha, to his home. But the young boy Samuel remained a minister of the Lord God before Heli the priest.
1 Samuel 2:13 Now the sons of Heli were worthless men who did not know the Lord God, nor did they perform the duty of priests toward the people as they should have.
1 Samuel 2:14 Indeed, this was the way of the priests with the people: whenever anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come while the meat was boiling, and he would have a three-pronged fork in his hand.
1 Samuel 2:15 He would thrust it into the large pot, or into the cauldron, or into the stewpot, or into the small pot, and whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is how they acted with all the people of Israel who came to Silo.
1 Samuel 2:16 Even before they burned the fat of the sacrifice—which was reserved for God—the priest's servant would come and say to the one offering the sacrifice, 'Give me meat to cook for the priest, for I will not accept cooked meat from you, but raw meat.'
1 Samuel 2:17 And the one offering the sacrifice would answer him, 'Let the fat be burned first today as is the custom, and then take for yourself whatever your heart desires.' But the servant, responding, would say to him, 'Absolutely not! You will give it to me at once. If you do not, I will take it by force.'
1 Samuel 2:18 Therefore, the sin of the young men was excessively great before the Lord God, because they caused people to turn away from the sacrifice due to the Lord God.
1 Samuel 2:19 But Samuel, a young boy, ministered before the Lord God, dressed in a linen ephod, a priestly garment.
1 Samuel 2:20 And his mother used to make him a little tunic, which she would bring to him on the appointed days when she went up with her husband to offer the solemn sacrifice.
1 Samuel 2:21 So Heli blessed Elcana and his wife, and said, 'May the Lord God give you offspring from this woman in return for the gift you lent to the Lord God—the boy Samuel.' And they went to their home.
1 Samuel 2:22 And so, the Lord God visited Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in stature before the Lord God.
1 Samuel 2:23 Now Heli had grown very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance of the tabernacle of the covenant.
1 Samuel 2:24 And he said to them, 'Why are you doing such things, which I hear reported as very wicked deeds by all the people?'
1 Samuel 2:25 'Do not do this, my sons, for the report I hear is not good. You are causing the Lord God's people to transgress.'
1 Samuel 2:26 'If a man sins against another man, God can intercede for him. But if a man sins against the Lord God, who will intercede for him?' But they did not listen to their father's voice, because the Lord God intended to put them to death.
1 Samuel 2:27 But the boy Samuel continued to grow and advance in favor with both the Lord God and with men.
1 Samuel 2:28 Then a man of God came to Heli and said to him, 'Thus says the Lord God: Did I not plainly reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt, in the house of Pharaoh?'
1 Samuel 2:29 'And I chose him—your ancestor Aaron—from all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up to My altar, and burn incense to Me, and to wear the ephod before Me. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel.'
1 Samuel 2:30 'Why then have you kicked away My sacrifice and My offerings which I commanded to be presented in the temple? And why have you honored your sons more than Me, so that you yourselves are made fat from the best parts of every sacrifice of My people Israel?'
1 Samuel 2:31 'Therefore, thus says the Lord God of Israel: I indeed said that your house and the house of your father would minister before Me forever. But now the Lord God says: Far be this from Me! Instead, whoever honors Me, I will honor him; but those who despise Me will be made insignificant.'
1 Samuel 2:32 'Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength—your arm—and the strength of your father's house, so that there will be no old man in your household.'
1 Samuel 2:33 'And you will see an adversary in the temple, amidst all the prosperity of Israel; and there will not be an old man in your house for all your days.'
1 Samuel 2:34 'And this will be the sign for you, which will happen to your two sons, Ophni and Phinees: both of them will die on the same day.'
1 Samuel 2:35 'And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will act according to My heart and My soul. And I will build him a sure house, and he will walk before My Anointed One all his days.'
1 Samuel 2:36 'And it will come to pass that everyone who remains in your house will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and say, 'Please, assign me to one of the priestly portions, so that I may eat a morsel of bread.''
1 Samuel 2:1 And Anna prayed, saying: 'My heart has rejoiced in the Lord; my strength, like a horn lifted high, has been made great by my God. My voice now speaks triumphantly over my enemies, because I have found great joy in Your deliverance.'
1 Samuel 2:2 There is no one holy like the Lord; indeed, there is no other God besides You, and no one is as strong as our God.
1 Samuel 2:3 Do not speak many proud and boastful words; let arrogance depart from your mouths. For the Lord is the God of all knowledge, and He weighs every thought and intention.
1 Samuel 2:4 The bows of the mighty are broken, but those who were weak are now girded with strength.
1 Samuel 2:5 Those who were once full and well-fed are now reduced to working for bread, while those who were starving are now satisfied. Even the barren woman has borne many children, and she who had many children has become feeble and desolate.
1 Samuel 2:6 The Lord brings death and brings life; He leads down to the realm of the dead and brings back up again.
1 Samuel 2:7 The Lord makes one poor and makes one rich; He humbles and He exalts.
1 Samuel 2:8 He lifts the needy from the dust and raises the poor from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a glorious throne. For the foundations of the earth are the Lord's, and He has established the world upon them.
1 Samuel 2:9 He will guard the steps of His saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. For no one is strong by their own might.
1 Samuel 2:10 His adversaries will fear the Lord; over them He will thunder from the universe. The Lord will judge the ends of the earth, and He will give power to His King, and He will exalt the strength of His Anointed One.
1 Samuel 2:11 Then Elcana went to his home in Ramatha. But the child Samuel remained as a minister of the Lord, serving before Eli the priest.
1 Samuel 2:12 Now the sons of Eli were wicked men, sons of Belial, who did not know or acknowledge the Lord.
1 Samuel 2:13 Nor did they respect the priests' duty to the people. When anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come while the meat was boiling, holding a three-pronged fork in his hand.
1 Samuel 2:14 And he would thrust it into the cauldron, or the pot, or the kettle, or the pan. Whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Silo.
1 Samuel 2:15 Even before the fat was burned as an offering, the priest's servant would come and say to the one offering the sacrifice: 'Give me meat to roast for the priest, for I will not accept cooked meat from you, but only raw meat.'
1 Samuel 2:16 And the man offering the sacrifice would answer him: 'Let the fat be burned first today, as is the custom, then take for yourself whatever your soul desires.' But the servant would say to him: 'No, by no means; you must give it to me immediately, or else I will take it by force.'
1 Samuel 2:17 Therefore, the sin of these young men was exceedingly great before the Lord, because they were causing men to withdraw from offering sacrifice to the Lord.
1 Samuel 2:18 But Samuel, the young boy, ministered before the Lord, clothed with a linen ephod, a sacred garment.
1 Samuel 2:19 And his mother used to make him a little tunic, which she would bring to him year after year, when she would go up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
1 Samuel 2:20 And Eli blessed Elcana and his wife, and he said: 'May the Lord grant you offspring from this woman in return for the one that was given to the Lord.' Then they went to their home.
1 Samuel 2:21 So the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in importance before the Lord.
1 Samuel 2:22 Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all of Israel; specifically, how they were lying with the women who served at the entrance of the tabernacle of the covenant.
1 Samuel 2:23 And he said to them: 'Why are you doing such things? I hear of these very wicked deeds from all the people.'
1 Samuel 2:24 'Do not, my sons, for the report I hear is not good, that you cause the Lord's people to transgress.'
1 Samuel 2:25 If a man sins against another man, God can intercede for him; but if a man sins against the Lord, who can pray for him? But they did not listen to the voice of their father, for the Lord had already decided to put them to death.
1 Samuel 2:26 But the boy Samuel continued to grow and advance in stature and favor, pleasing both the Lord and mankind.
1 Samuel 2:27 Then a man of God came to Eli and said to him: 'Thus says the Lord: Did I not clearly reveal Myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt, in the house of Pharaoh?'
1 Samuel 2:28 'And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to ascend to My altar, to burn incense for Me, and to wear the ephod before Me. And I gave to the house of your father all the fire offerings of the sons of Israel.'
1 Samuel 2:29 'Why then have you kicked aside My sacrifice and My offerings, which I commanded to be offered in the temple? And why have you honored your sons more than Me, enriching yourselves with the best parts of every sacrifice of My servant Israel?'
1 Samuel 2:30 Therefore, the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: 'I indeed said that your house and the house of your father would minister before Me forever. But now the Lord says: Far be it from Me! Rather, whoever glorifies Me, him will I glorify; but those who despise Me shall be brought to dishonor.'
1 Samuel 2:31 'Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will be no old man in your house.'
1 Samuel 2:32 'And you will see an adversary in My dwelling place, amidst all the prosperity of Israel, yet there will be no old man in your house for all your days.'
1 Samuel 2:33 'Nevertheless, I will not cut off every last one of yours from My altar, but only so that his eyes may fail and his soul waste away. And all the offspring of your house will die in the prime of their lives.'
1 Samuel 2:34 'And this will be the sign for you, which is about to come to pass regarding your two sons, Ophni and Phinees: on one day, both will die.'
1 Samuel 2:35 'And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will act according to My heart and My soul. And I will build him a faithful house, and he will walk before My Anointed One all his days.'
1 Samuel 2:36 'And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down before him to receive a silver coin and a loaf of bread, and will say: 'Please, let me belong to one of the priestly portions, so that I may eat a morsel of bread.''
1 Samuel 2:37 There is no thirty-seventh verse.
1 Samuel 2:38 There is no thirty-eighth verse.
1 Samuel 2:39 There is no thirty-ninth verse.
1 Samuel 2:40 There is no fortieth verse.
1 Samuel 3:1 The boy Samuel was serving the Lord in the presence of Eli, but in those days, the word of the Lord was rare, and there were no clear visions or prophecies from God.
1 Samuel 3:2 And it came to pass on a certain occasion that Eli was sleeping in his customary place. His eyes had grown so dim that he could not see.
1 Samuel 3:3 Before the lamps in the house of God had been extinguished for the morning, Samuel was sleeping in the Lord's sanctuary, where the Ark of God was kept.
1 Samuel 3:4 And the Lord called Samuel. Samuel answered, saying, 'Here I am.'
1 Samuel 3:5 So Samuel ran to Eli and said, 'Here I am, for you called me.' Eli replied, 'I did not call you. Go back to sleep.' So Samuel went and lay down again.
1 Samuel 3:6 And the Lord called Samuel again. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, 'Here I am, for you called me.' Eli answered, 'I did not call you, my son. Go back to sleep.'
1 Samuel 3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord personally in this manner, nor had the word of the Lord been revealed to him in such a way before.
1 Samuel 3:8 And the Lord called Samuel a third time. Samuel rose, went to Eli, and said, 'Here I am, for you called me.' Then Eli understood that it was the Lord calling the boy.
1 Samuel 3:9 So Eli said to Samuel, 'Go and sleep. If He calls you again, you are to say, 'Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.'' So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
1 Samuel 3:10 And the Lord came and stood there, and called as He had called before, 'Samuel, Samuel!' And Samuel said, 'Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.'
1 Samuel 3:11 And the Lord said to Samuel, 'Behold, I am about to do something in Israel that will make both ears of everyone who hears of it ring with shock.'
1 Samuel 3:12 'On that very day, I will carry out against Eli everything I have spoken against his house, from beginning to end.'
1 Samuel 3:13 'For I have told him that I will judge his house forever because of the iniquity of his sons, who have blasphemed God, and he did not restrain them.'
1 Samuel 3:14 'Therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli: The iniquity of his house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering, not for all time.'
1 Samuel 3:15 So Samuel slept until morning, and then he opened the doors of the Lord's house. But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision.
1 Samuel 3:16 Eli then called Samuel and said, 'Samuel, my son.' And Samuel answered, 'Here I am.'
1 Samuel 3:17 Eli said, 'What is the message that was given to you? I implore you, do not hide it from me. May God do to you even worse, if you hide from me even one of all the words that were spoken to you.'
1 Samuel 3:18 So Samuel told him all the words and hid nothing from him. Eli then responded, 'It is the Lord; let Him do what is good in His sight.'
1 Samuel 3:19 Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and none of His words that He spoke through Samuel fell to the ground unfulfilled.
1 Samuel 3:20 And all Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, recognized that Samuel was a faithful prophet of the Lord.
1 Samuel 3:21 And the Lord continued to appear in Shiloh, because the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of the Lord.
1 Samuel 4:1 It happened during that time that the Philistines gathered their forces for war. The people of Israel went out to fight against them, and set up their camp near a place called Ebenezer—which means 'Stone of Help'.
1 Samuel 4:2 Israel lined up for battle against the Philistines. When the fighting began, the people of Israel turned and fled from the Philistines. About thirty thousand of Israel’s foot soldiers were killed there.
1 Samuel 4:3 When the surviving people returned to their camp, the leading elders of Israel said: 'Why did the Lord allow the Philistines to defeat us today? Let us bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from Shiloh, and let it come into our midst. Then it will save us from the power of our enemies.'
1 Samuel 4:4 So the people sent word to Shiloh, and they brought from there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of Hosts, who sits enthroned above the Cherubim. Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were with the Ark of God's Covenant.
1 Samuel 4:5 When the Ark of the Lord's Covenant arrived in the camp, all of Israel shouted with a great outcry, and the entire land echoed with the sound.
1 Samuel 4:6 The Philistines heard the sound of the outcry and asked: 'What is this sound of a great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?' They quickly realized that the Ark of the Lord had come into their camp.
1 Samuel 4:7 Then the Philistines became afraid and said: 'God has come into their camp!' They groaned in fear and said:
1 Samuel 4:8 'Woe to us! Nothing like this great rejoicing has happened before, not yesterday nor the day before! Woe to us! Who will save us from the power of this mighty God? These are the gods who struck Egypt with every kind of plague in the wilderness.'
1 Samuel 4:9 'Be strong, Philistines! Act like men! Do not serve the Hebrews, just as they have served you. Be men, and fight!'
1 Samuel 4:10 So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was exceedingly great, and thirty thousand men of Israel fell dead.
1 Samuel 4:11 And the Ark of God was captured. Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
1 Samuel 4:12 But a man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that same day. His clothes were torn, and his head was covered with dust, showing his grief and distress.
1 Samuel 4:13 When he arrived, Eli was sitting on a chair beside the road, looking out—for his heart was trembling with fear for the Ark of God. After the man entered, he announced the news to the city, and the entire city cried out in lament.
1 Samuel 4:14 Eli heard the sound of the outcry and asked: 'What is this sound of a great uproar?' The man hurried, came to Eli, and told him the news.
1 Samuel 4:15 Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes had grown dim, so he could not see.
1 Samuel 4:16 The man said to Eli: 'I am the one who came from the battle. I fled from the battle line today.' Eli then asked him: 'What happened, my son?'
1 Samuel 4:17 The messenger answered: 'Israel has fled before the Philistines, and a great slaughter has occurred among the people. Moreover, your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead. And the Ark of God has been captured.'
1 Samuel 4:18 When the messenger mentioned the Ark of God, Eli fell backward from his chair beside the gate. His neck was broken, and he died. For the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.
1 Samuel 4:19 His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was pregnant and close to giving birth. When she heard the news that the Ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she bowed down and gave birth, for sudden labor pains came upon her.
1 Samuel 4:20 Just as she was dying, those who stood around her said: 'Do not fear, for you have given birth to a son!' But she did not answer, nor did she pay attention to their words.
1 Samuel 4:21 And she named the child Ichabod, saying: 'The glory has departed from Israel,' because the Ark of God had been captured, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
1 Samuel 4:22 She emphasized, 'The glory has departed from Israel, because the Ark of God has been captured!'
1 Samuel 5:1 And the Philistines took the Ark of God, carrying it away from the Stone of Help—the place where Israel was defeated—to the city of Ashdod.
1 Samuel 5:2 So the Philistines took the Ark of God into the temple of their god Dagon and set it up right next to the idol of Dagon.
1 Samuel 5:3 When the people of Ashdod woke up the next morning, they found Dagon lying face down on the ground before the Ark of the Lord. So they picked up Dagon and put him back in his place.
1 Samuel 5:4 But when they got up early the following morning, they again found Dagon lying face down on the ground before the Ark of the Lord. This time, Dagon's head and both of his hands were cut off and lying on the threshold of the temple, with only the trunk of Dagon's body remaining intact.
1 Samuel 5:5 Because of this event, the priests of Dagon and all who enter the temple of Dagon in Ashdod have not stepped on the threshold of Dagon, even to this very day.
1 Samuel 5:6 But the hand of the Lord weighed heavily upon the people of Ashdod, and He devastated them. He struck the people of Ashdod and their surrounding territory in their own homes, causing painful tumors to break out on them.
1 Samuel 5:7 When the men of Ashdod saw the nature of this plague, they said, "The Ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, because His hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon, our god."
1 Samuel 5:8 So they sent for and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines to them and asked, "What shall we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?" They answered, "Let the Ark of the God of Israel be taken around to Gath." So the Ark of the God of Israel was carried there.
1 Samuel 5:9 After it was carried to Gath, the hand of the Lord fell upon that city with extremely great destruction. He struck the men of the city, from the youngest to the oldest, and painful tumors broke out on them.
1 Samuel 5:10 So they sent the Ark of God to Ekron. When the Ark of God arrived in Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, saying, "They have brought the Ark of the God of Israel to us, intending to kill us and our people!"
1 Samuel 5:11 So they sent and gathered all the rulers of the Philistines, and they said, "Send away the Ark of the God of Israel! Let it return to its own place, so it will not kill us and our people." For a confusion of death—a deadly panic—had spread throughout the entire city, and the hand of God was very heavy there.
1 Samuel 5:12 Even the men who did not die were tormented with tumors, and the wailing of each city went up to the sky.
1 Samuel 5:1 The Philistines took the Ark of God, and carried it away from the Stone of Help to Azotus.
1 Samuel 5:2 And the Philistines brought the Ark of God into the temple of Dagon, and set it beside Dagon.
1 Samuel 5:3 But when the people of Azotus arose the next day, behold, Dagon was lying face down on the ground before the Ark of the Lord; so they took Dagon and put him back in his place.
1 Samuel 5:4 And again, when they arose early on the next day, they found Dagon lying on the ground, face down before the Ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both of his hands were cut off, lying on the threshold. Only Dagon's torso remained intact.
1 Samuel 5:5 Because of this, the priests of Dagon and all who enter the temple of Dagon in Azotus do not step on Dagon's threshold, even to this day.
1 Samuel 5:6 And the hand of the Lord grew heavy upon the people of Azotus; He utterly destroyed them, and struck them with tumors in their secret parts, both Azotus and its surrounding areas.
1 Samuel 5:7 When the men of Azotus saw the plague, they said: "The Ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, because His hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god."
1 Samuel 5:8 So they sent for and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said: "What shall we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?" They answered: "Let the Ark of the God of Israel be carried to Geth." And so they carried the Ark of the God of Israel there.
1 Samuel 5:9 And it came to pass, after they had carried it there, the hand of the Lord fell upon the city with a very great destruction; He struck the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors erupted upon them in their secret parts.
1 Samuel 5:10 So they sent the Ark of God to Accaron. When the Ark of God came to Accaron, the people of Accaron cried out, saying: "They have brought the Ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!"
1 Samuel 5:11 Therefore, they sent for and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and said: "Send away the Ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, so that it may not kill us and our people." For there had been a deadly plague throughout the entire city, and a great terror; and the hand of God was exceedingly heavy upon them.
1 Samuel 5:12 And those men who did not die were struck with tumors in their secret parts; and the cry of each city ascended even to the heavens.
1 Samuel 6:1 The Ark of the Lord had remained in the land of the Philistines for seven months.
1 Samuel 6:2 So the Philistines called for their priests and diviners, asking, 'What should we do with the Ark of the Lord? How can we send it back to its rightful place?'
1 Samuel 6:3 They answered, 'If you are going to send back the Ark of the God of Israel, do not send it back empty. Instead, you must give Him a guilt offering for the sin you have committed. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why His hand has not stopped punishing you.'
1 Samuel 6:4 Then the Philistines asked, 'What sort of guilt offering should we return to Him?'
1 Samuel 6:5 They replied, 'You must make five golden tumors, representing the plague’s effect, and five golden mice, according to the number of the Philistine rulers. This is because there was one plague afflicting all of you and your leaders.'
1 Samuel 6:6 Why do you harden your hearts, just as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs? After God struck them with plagues, did they not then let the Israelites go, and they departed?
1 Samuel 6:7 Now then, make a new cart. Take two nursing cows that have never been yoked, and harness them to the cart. Shut up their calves at home, so they cannot follow their mothers.
1 Samuel 6:8 Then take the Ark of the Lord and place it on the cart. Put the golden offerings, which you must return to Him for your sin, in a small box beside it. Then send the cart away and let it go where it may.
1 Samuel 6:9 Watch closely: if it goes up the road towards Beth Shemesh, then it means He Himself has inflicted this great harm upon us. But if it does not, then we will know that His hand did not touch us, and it was merely an accident.
1 Samuel 6:10 So the men did as they were told: they took two nursing cows and yoked them to the cart. Then they shut up their calves at home.
1 Samuel 6:11 They then placed the Ark of the Lord on the cart, along with the small box containing the golden mice and the likenesses of the tumors.
1 Samuel 6:12 The cows went straight along the road leading to Beth Shemesh, traveling directly without turning either to the right or to the left, all the while lowing in distress—a supernatural sign. The Philistine rulers followed them all the way to the borders of Beth Shemesh.
1 Samuel 6:13 Now, the people of Beth Shemesh were reaping wheat in the valley. When they lifted their eyes and saw the Ark, they greatly rejoiced at the sight.
1 Samuel 6:14 The cart came into the field of Joshua, a man from Beth Shemesh, and stopped there. There was a large stone in that place. So they chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows upon it as a burnt offering to the Lord.
1 Samuel 6:15 The Levites then took down the Ark of the Lord and the small box that was next to it, which contained the golden offerings. They placed these upon the large stone. The men of Beth Shemesh, for their part, offered burnt offerings and sacrificed other victims to the Lord on that day.
1 Samuel 6:16 After witnessing all of this, the five Philistine rulers returned to Ekron that same day.
1 Samuel 6:17 These are the golden tumors which the Philistines offered to the Lord as a guilt offering for their sin: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron.
1 Samuel 6:18 And there were golden mice matching the number of all the Philistine towns across the five territories, from the walled cities down to the smallest unwalled villages. This includes the great stone where they placed the Ark of the Lord, which is in the field of Joshua, a man from Beth Shemesh.
1 Samuel 6:19 But the Lord struck down some of the men of Beth Shemesh because they had looked irreverently into the Ark of the Lord. He struck seventy men among the people, and fifty thousand of the common people. The people mourned greatly because the Lord had struck them with such a severe blow.
1 Samuel 6:20 The men of Beth Shemesh asked, 'Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, the holy God? And to whom shall this Ark ascend from us now?' —meaning, 'Who can take it away from us?'
1 Samuel 6:21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, 'The Philistines have brought back the Ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up to your city.'
1 Samuel 6:1 The Ark of the Lord had been in the land of the Philistines for seven full days.
1 Samuel 6:2 Then the Philistines summoned their priests and soothsayers, asking, 'What shall we do with the Ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its own place.'
1 Samuel 6:3 They responded, 'If you return the Ark of the God of Israel, you must not send it back empty. Instead, you must give Him a guilt offering for the sin you have committed. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why His hand has not stopped afflicting you.'
1 Samuel 6:4 The Philistines asked them, 'What is the nature of the guilt offering we owe Him?' They answered, 'According to the number of the Philistine rulers, you must offer five golden tumors and five golden mice. This is because the same plague has afflicted all of you and your rulers.'
1 Samuel 6:5 Therefore, you must make images resembling your tumors and images resembling the mice that have devastated your land. You must give glory to the God of Israel, hoping that He might lift His hand from you, from your gods, and from your land.
1 Samuel 6:6 Why would you harden your hearts, just as Egypt and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? Was it not after He struck them that Pharaoh finally released the Israelites, and they departed?
1 Samuel 6:7 So now, prepare a new cart, and harness two milk cows that have never worn a yoke to the cart. Then take their calves away from them and bring the calves back home.
1 Samuel 6:8 Take the Ark of the Lord and place it on the cart. Put the golden offerings you have given Him as a guilt offering in a box beside it. Then release the cart and let it go on its own.
1 Samuel 6:9 Watch closely: if the cart ascends along the road to Beth Shemesh by its own route, then He has indeed inflicted this great evil upon us. But if not, then we will know that His hand did not touch us, and this was merely a random misfortune.
1 Samuel 6:10 So the men followed these instructions: they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, but they shut their calves back home.
1 Samuel 6:11 They placed the Ark of God upon the cart, along with the box containing the golden mice and the images of the tumors.
1 Samuel 6:12 The cows walked straight along the road toward Beth Shemesh, staying on a single path. They continued moo-ing as they went, turning neither to the right nor to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed behind them all the way to the border of Beth Shemesh.
1 Samuel 6:13 Now, the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they lifted their eyes, they saw the Ark, and they rejoiced greatly at the sight.
1 Samuel 6:14 The cart arrived in the field belonging to Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped there. There was a large stone in that place. The people then chopped up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord on the fire.
1 Samuel 6:15 The Levites carefully took down the Ark of God, and the box that was beside it, in which were the golden vessels; and they placed them on that great stone. The men of Beth Shemesh then offered burnt offerings and sacrificed other sacrifices to the Lord on that day.
1 Samuel 6:16 After seeing all of this, the five rulers of the Philistines returned to Ekron that same day.
1 Samuel 6:17 These are the golden tumors that the Philistines rendered to the Lord as a guilt offering for their sin: one from Ashdod, one from Gaza, one from Ashkelon, one from Gath, and one from Ekron.
1 Samuel 6:18 And the golden mice corresponded to the number of all the Philistine cities across their five provinces, from the fortified city to the unwalled village, right up to the great stone on which they placed the Ark of the Lord, which was in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
1 Samuel 6:19 But the Lord struck down some of the men of Beth Shemesh because they had looked inside the Ark of the Lord. He struck down seventy men from the people, and fifty thousand of the common folk. The people mourned greatly because the Lord had afflicted them with such a severe plague.
1 Samuel 6:20 The men of Beth Shemesh said, 'Who can stand in the presence of this holy Lord God? And to whom will He go up from us?'
1 Samuel 6:21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, 'The Philistines have returned the Ark of the Lord. Come down and take it back to your own place.'
1 Samuel 7:1 So the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and they brought the Ark of the Lord there. They brought it into Abinadab's house, which was on the hill. Then they consecrated Abinadab's son, Eleazar, for the sacred duty of guarding the Ark of the Lord.
1 Samuel 7:2 And it came to pass that from the day the Ark of the Lord remained in Kiriath-jearim, many days accumulated, and twenty full years passed by. And all the house of Israel then turned back to the Lord, seeking His rest and favor.
1 Samuel 7:3 Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying: 'If you are truly returning to the Lord with all your heart, then you must remove all foreign gods and the goddesses of Astarte from your midst. Prepare your hearts solely for the Lord and serve Him alone. If you do this, He will deliver you from the power of the Philistines.'
1 Samuel 7:4 So the sons of Israel removed the Baalim and the Astartes, and they served the Lord alone.
1 Samuel 7:5 Then Samuel said: 'Gather all of Israel at Mizpah, so that I may pray to the Lord for you there.'
1 Samuel 7:6 So they gathered at Mizpah, and they drew water and poured it out before the Lord, performing a symbolic act of pouring out their hearts. They also fasted on that day, and there they confessed, saying, 'We have sinned against the Lord.' And Samuel acted as a judge for the sons of Israel in Mizpah, hearing their disputes and providing guidance.
1 Samuel 7:7 Now the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, so the princes of the Philistines went up against Israel to attack them. When the sons of Israel heard this, they were terrified of the Philistines.
1 Samuel 7:8 And they said to Samuel, 'Do not cease to cry out for us to the Lord our God, that He may save us from the power of the Philistines.'
1 Samuel 7:9 So Samuel took one suckling lamb, and he offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. And Samuel cried out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord heard him, granting his prayer.
1 Samuel 7:10 It came to pass, therefore, as Samuel was offering the burnt offering, that the Philistines advanced to battle against Israel. But the Lord thundered with a great voice over the Philistines on that very day, and He threw them into confusion, and they were struck down by the sons of Israel.
1 Samuel 7:11 And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah, pursued the Philistines, and struck them down all the way to the place below Beth-car.
1 Samuel 7:12 Then Samuel took one stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He called the name of that place 'Stone of Help,' saying, 'Up to this point, the Lord has helped us.'
1 Samuel 7:13 So the Philistines were humbled; they no longer entered the territory of Israel. Thus, the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel, holding them back and defeating them.
1 Samuel 7:14 And the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron as far as Gath, including all their surrounding territories. Thus, Israel was delivered from the power of the Philistines. There was also peace established between Israel and the Amorites, their other neighbors.
1 Samuel 7:15 Samuel continued to judge Israel throughout all the days of his life,
1 Samuel 7:16 and each year he would go on a circuit, visiting Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. In these aforementioned places, he would judge Israel, addressing their legal and spiritual needs.
1 Samuel 7:17 He would then return to Ramah, for his home was there, and there he also judged Israel. And, in Ramah, he built an altar to the Lord.

1 Samuel 7:1 Therefore, the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and they brought the ark of the Lord. They carried it into the house of Abinadab, which was situated on the hill, and they consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of the Lord.
1 Samuel 7:2 From the day that the ark of the Lord remained in Kiriath-jearim, many days passed—twenty years had already gone by. And all the house of Israel turned their hearts toward the Lord for guidance and peace.
1 Samuel 7:3 Samuel then said to all the house of Israel: 'If you truly return to the Lord with all your heart, then remove the foreign gods from your midst, and take away the idols of Astaroth from your lands. Prepare your hearts solely for the Lord and serve Him alone, and He will deliver you from the power of the Philistines.'
1 Samuel 7:4 So the sons of Israel put away the idols of Baal and Astaroth, and they served the Lord alone.
1 Samuel 7:5 Samuel then said, 'Gather all of yourselves at Mizpah, so that I may pray to the Lord on your behalf.'
1 Samuel 7:6 So they gathered at Mizpah. They drew water and poured it out before the Lord as a sign of their repentance, and they fasted on that day. And they confessed there, saying, 'We have sinned against the Lord.' And Samuel presided over the sons of Israel in judgment at Mizpah, guiding them in justice and righteousness.
1 Samuel 7:7 Now, the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel were gathered at Mizpah, and the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack Israel. When the sons of Israel heard this, they became very afraid at the approach of the Philistines.
1 Samuel 7:8 And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, 'Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God on our behalf, that He may save us from the power of the Philistines!'
1 Samuel 7:9 Then Samuel took a single suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering, completely consumed, to the Lord. And Samuel cried out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord heard his prayer.
1 Samuel 7:10 Now, as Samuel was offering the burnt offering, the Philistines pressed hard in battle against Israel. But on that very day, the Lord thundered with a mighty voice over the Philistines. They were thrown into utter confusion and were struck down by the sons of Israel.
1 Samuel 7:11 So the sons of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines. They struck them down all the way to the place just below Beth-car.
1 Samuel 7:12 Then Samuel took a single stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and he named that place 'The Stone of Help.' He declared, 'Up to this very moment, the Lord has continually helped us!'
1 Samuel 7:13 Thus, the Philistines were completely humbled and no longer ventured into the territories of Israel. Indeed, the mighty hand of the Lord was against the Philistines throughout all the days that Samuel lived.
1 Samuel 7:14 Furthermore, the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel, from Ekron to Gath, along with their surrounding lands, were all restored to Israel. And Israel was delivered from the power of the Philistines. Peace was also established between Israel and the Amorites.
1 Samuel 7:15 And Samuel continued to judge and guide Israel throughout all the days of his life.
1 Samuel 7:16 Year after year, he would travel in a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he would judge Israel in those same places.
1 Samuel 7:17 Then he would return to Ramah, for his home was there. And there he also judged Israel, and he built an altar there dedicated to the Lord.
1 Samuel 8:1 Now it came to pass that when Samuel became old, he then appointed his own sons to be judges over the people of Israel.
1 Samuel 8:2 And the name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second son was Abia. These two were judges in Bersabee.
1 Samuel 8:3 But his sons did not walk in Samuel's ways of righteous judgment. Instead, they turned aside after greed, accepting bribes and perverting justice.
1 Samuel 8:4 Therefore, all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel in Rama.
1 Samuel 8:5 And they said to him: "Behold, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now therefore, appoint for us a king to govern us, just as all the nations around us have kings."
1 Samuel 8:6 This word displeased Samuel, because they had said: "Give us a king to govern us." And Samuel prayed to the Lord about this matter.
1 Samuel 8:7 Then the Lord said to Samuel: "Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you. For they have not rejected you as their leader; rather, they have rejected Me, so that I should not reign over them as their true King."
1 Samuel 8:8 According to all their works which they have done, from the day I brought them out of Egypt even to this very day— just as they have forsaken Me and served other gods— so also are they doing to you, My servant Samuel.
1 Samuel 8:9 Now therefore, listen to their voice. Nevertheless, solemnly warn them, and declare to them the rights of the king who shall reign over them.
1 Samuel 8:10 So Samuel spoke all the words of the Lord to the people who had asked him for a king.
1 Samuel 8:11 And he said: "This will be the nature of the king who is to reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for his chariots and make them his horsemen, and they will run before his chariots as heralds."
1 Samuel 8:12 And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and those to plow his fields and to reap his harvests, and to make his instruments of war and his chariots.
1 Samuel 8:13 He will also take your daughters and make them perfumers, and cooks, and bakers for his royal household.
1 Samuel 8:14 He will take your best fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants.
1 Samuel 8:15 He will also take a tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, to give to his eunuchs and his servants.
1 Samuel 8:16 He will take your male and female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his own work.
1 Samuel 8:17 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will be his servants, serving him directly.
1 Samuel 8:18 And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the Lord will not hear you in that day, because you have asked for a king for yourselves.
1 Samuel 8:19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel. Instead, they said: "No, this is not so; but a king shall be over us!"
1 Samuel 8:20 They continued: "And we will be like all the other nations, and our king will judge us, and he will go out before us and fight our battles for us."
1 Samuel 8:21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he spoke them in the ears of the Lord.
1 Samuel 8:22 And the Lord said to Samuel: "Listen to their voice and appoint a king over them." Then Samuel said to the men of Israel: "Each man among you, return to his own city." This was to prepare for the selection of the king.
1 Samuel 8:1 Now it happened that when Samuel had grown old, he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel.
1 Samuel 8:2 His firstborn son was named Joel, and his second son was named Abiah. They were serving as judges in Beersheba.
1 Samuel 8:3 But his sons did not follow his ways. Instead, they turned to pursue greed, accepted bribes, and twisted justice.
1 Samuel 8:4 Therefore, all the elders of Israel gathered and came to Samuel in Ramah.
1 Samuel 8:5 And they said to him: 'Look, you have grown old, and your sons are not following your example. So now, appoint a king for us to govern us, just as all the other nations have.'
1 Samuel 8:6 This request displeased Samuel because they had said, 'Give us a king to govern us.' So Samuel prayed to the Lord.
1 Samuel 8:7 But the Lord said to Samuel: 'Listen to everything the people are telling you. For they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being their King.'
1 Samuel 8:8 Just as they have done all their evil deeds from the day I brought them out of Egypt until this very day—forsaking Me and serving foreign gods—so they are doing to you now.
1 Samuel 8:9 So now, listen to what they say. But solemnly warn them and tell them about the ways of the king who will reign over them.
1 Samuel 8:10 So Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who had asked him for a king.
1 Samuel 8:11 And he said: 'This will be the manner of the king who will rule over you: He will take your sons and assign them to his chariots, making them his horsemen and his runners to go before his chariots.'
1 Samuel 8:12 He will also appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties. He will make your sons his field workers, to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his weapons and chariots.
1 Samuel 8:13 He will also take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers for him.
1 Samuel 8:14 He will take your best fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his own servants.
1 Samuel 8:15 He will also take a tenth of your grain and of your vineyards to give to his officials and servants.
1 Samuel 8:16 He will take your male servants and female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and use them for his own work.
1 Samuel 8:17 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.
1 Samuel 8:18 And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.
1 Samuel 8:19 But the people refused to listen to Samuel. They said: 'Absolutely not! There must be a king over us.'
1 Samuel 8:20 We want to be like all the other nations. Our king will govern us, he will go out before us, and he will fight our battles for us.
1 Samuel 8:21 Samuel heard all the words of the people and reported them to the Lord.
1 Samuel 8:22 Then the Lord said to Samuel: 'Listen to what they say, and appoint a king over them.' So Samuel said to the men of Israel: 'Everyone may now return home to his own city.'
1 Samuel 8:23 Now there was a man from the tribe of Benjamin named Kish, the son of Abiel, who was the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah. He was a mighty man of valor from Benjamin.
1 Samuel 8:24 He had a son named Saul, a handsome young man. There was no man among the Israelites more handsome than he; he stood a head taller than any of the people.
1 Samuel 8:25 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had gone astray. So Kish said to Saul his son: 'Take one of the servants with you, go and search for the donkeys.'
1 Samuel 8:26 They passed through the hill country of Ephraim, then through the land of Shalishah, but they found nothing. Next, they passed through the land of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, and found nothing.
1 Samuel 8:27 When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him: 'Come, let us turn back, lest my father, having stopped worrying about the donkeys, should now become anxious about us.'
1 Samuel 8:28 The servant replied: 'Look, there is a man of God in this city, a very respected man. Everything he says certainly comes true. So now, let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us where to go to find what we came for.'
1 Samuel 8:29 Saul then said to his servant: 'But if we go, what can we give the man of God? We have run out of bread in our bags, and we have no present to give to the man of God. We have nothing at all.'
1 Samuel 8:30 Again, the servant answered Saul and said: 'Look, I happen to have a fourth of a shekel of silver with me. Let’s give that to the man of God so he can tell us where to go.'
1 Samuel 8:31 This is how people used to speak in Israel: when someone went to inquire of God, they would say, 'Come, let us go to the seer.' For the one who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.
1 Samuel 8:32 Saul then said to his servant: 'That’s a good idea; come, let us go.' So they went to the city where the man of God was.
1 Samuel 8:33 As they were going up the hill to the city, they met young women coming out to draw water, and they asked them: 'Is the seer here?'
1 Samuel 8:34 They answered them: 'Yes, he is right ahead of you. Hurry now! He came to the city today because there is a sacrifice for the people on the high place.'
1 Samuel 8:35 As soon as he arrives, the people will eat. For they do not eat until he comes and blesses the sacrifice, and then those who are invited eat. So go up now, because today you will find him.
1 Samuel 8:36 So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, Samuel was coming out to meet them, on his way up to the high place.
1 Samuel 8:37 Now the Lord had secretly informed Samuel the day before Saul came, saying:
1 Samuel 8:38 About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be commander over My people Israel. He will save My people from the power of the Philistines, for I have seen My people’s affliction, and their cry has reached Me.
1 Samuel 8:39 When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him: 'There is the man of whom I spoke to you! This one shall rule over My people.'
1 Samuel 8:40 Then Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and said: 'Please tell me, where is the house of the seer?'
1 Samuel 9:1 There was a man from the tribe of Benjamin whose name was Kish. He was the son of Abiel, who was the son of Zeror, who was the son of Bechorath, who was the son of Aphiah. Kish was also the son of a certain Benjamite man who was mighty in strength.
1 Samuel 9:2 Kish had a son whose name was Saul. Saul was an excellent and good man, and there was no one among the sons of Israel more handsome than him. From his shoulders upwards, he was taller than all the people.
1 Samuel 9:3 However, some of the donkeys belonging to Kish, Saul's father, had wandered off and were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul: 'Take one of the young servants with you, go out, and search for the donkeys.'
1 Samuel 9:4 They traveled through the hill country of Ephraim, and then through the land of Shalisha, but they didn't find the donkeys there. They then crossed through the land of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there either. Next, they went through the land of Benjamin itself, but they found nothing.
1 Samuel 9:5 When they arrived in the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him: 'Come, let's go back now.' 'Otherwise, my father might stop worrying about the lost donkeys and start worrying about us instead.'
1 Samuel 9:6 The servant answered him: 'Look, there's a man of God in this city. He is a very respected prophet.' 'Everything he says comes true, exactly as he says it.' 'Let's go there now; perhaps he can tell us about our journey and where to find the donkeys.'
1 Samuel 9:7 Saul then said to his servant: 'But if we go, what can we give the man?' 'We've run out of bread in our bags, and we have no small gift to offer to this man of God.' 'We don't have anything at all left.'
1 Samuel 9:8 The servant replied to Saul again and said: 'Look, I have a quarter of a shekel of silver with me.' 'I can give that to the man of God so he can tell us where to go.'
1 Samuel 9:9 In earlier times, this was the custom in Israel: when people went to consult God, they would say: 'Come, let's go to the seer.' This is because the one who is called a 'prophet' today was formerly called a 'seer'.
1 Samuel 9:10 Saul said to his servant: 'Your suggestion is an excellent one. Come, let's go.' So they went to the city where the man of God was living.
1 Samuel 9:11 As they were climbing the hill leading up to the city, they met some young women coming out to draw water. Saul and his servant asked them: 'Is the seer here in this place?'
1 Samuel 9:12 The young women answered them: 'Yes, he is! He's just ahead of you.' 'Hurry now, because today the people are making a sacrifice at the high place, and he will be there.'
1 Samuel 9:13 As soon as you enter the city, you will find him at once, before he goes up to the high place to eat the sacrificial meal. The people will not eat until he arrives and blesses the sacrifice. Only then will those who have been invited to the feast eat. So go up now, because you will certainly find him today.
1 Samuel 9:14 So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, behold, Samuel was coming out to meet them on his way to the high place.
1 Samuel 9:15 Now, the Lord had revealed a message to Samuel just one day before Saul arrived, saying:
1 Samuel 9:16 'At this very time tomorrow, I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin.' 'You are to anoint him as the chosen leader over My people, Israel.' 'He himself will deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines, because I have looked upon My people's suffering, and their cry for help has reached Me.'
1 Samuel 9:17 When Samuel saw Saul approaching, the Lord said to him: 'Behold the man of whom I spoke to you!' 'This is the one who will rule over My people, Israel.'
1 Samuel 9:18 Saul then approached Samuel, right in the middle of the city gate, and asked: 'Please tell me, where is the house of the seer?'
1 Samuel 9:19 Samuel answered Saul, saying: 'I am the seer you are looking for!' 'Go up ahead of me to the high place so you can eat the sacrificial meal with me today.' 'I will send you on your way tomorrow morning, and I will reveal to you everything that is on your heart—the things you are concerned about.'
1 Samuel 9:20 And as for the donkeys you lost three days ago, don't worry about them, because they have already been found. Now, to whom will all the best things of Israel belong in the future? Is it not to you and to all the household of your father?
1 Samuel 9:21 Saul answered, saying: 'Am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe in Israel?' 'And is not my family the least significant among all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?' 'Why, then, do you speak such words to me, suggesting I am worthy of such honor?'
1 Samuel 9:22 Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and led them into the banquet hall. He gave them the most honored place among all those who had been invited to the feast, which included about thirty men.
1 Samuel 9:23 Samuel then said to the cook: 'Bring the portion of the meat that I specifically told you to set aside separately.'
1 Samuel 9:24 So the cook brought the choice cut—a leg or shoulder portion—and placed it before Saul. Samuel said: 'Look, this is what was reserved. Set it before you and eat, for it was intentionally kept for you when I invited the people to this sacrificial meal.' So Saul ate with Samuel on that day.
1 Samuel 9:25 Afterward, they came down from the high place into the town, and Samuel spoke with Saul on the rooftop of his house.
1 Samuel 9:26 They rose very early in the morning, and as the sun began to rise, Samuel called to Saul on the rooftop, saying: 'Get up now, so I can send you on your way.' Saul then rose, and both he and Samuel went outside the city.
1 Samuel 9:27 As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul: 'Tell your servant to go on ahead of us.' 'But you, stand still for a little while, so I can reveal to you the word of the Lord.'
1 Samuel 10:1 Samuel took a small flask of oil and poured it over Saul’s head. He then kissed Saul, showing his acceptance and loyalty. Samuel said to Saul: "See, the Lord has anointed you—this means you are chosen and set apart—to be a prince over His inheritance, which is the nation of Israel."
1 Samuel 10:2 As soon as you leave me today, you will find two men near Rachel’s tomb—which is located in the southern part of Benjamin’s territory. They will tell you: 'The donkeys you went searching for have been found.' And then they will add: 'Look, your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and is now anxious about you all, saying: "What should I do about my son?"'
1 Samuel 10:3 When you leave that place and travel a bit further, you will arrive at the oak of Tabor. Three men will meet you there, on their way to worship God in Bethel. Two of them will be carrying young goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and another will be carrying a flask of wine.
1 Samuel 10:4 They will greet you, and then they will offer you two loaves of bread, which you must accept from their hands.
1 Samuel 10:5 After this, you will come to the hill of God—a place where the Lord is worshipped. There is a Philistine garrison stationed there. When you enter the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place of worship. They will have a psaltery, a drum, a flute, and a harp playing before them, and they will be prophesying—meaning they will be in a state of inspired worship, singing, and possibly speaking under divine influence.
1 Samuel 10:6 Then the Spirit of the Lord will powerfully rush upon you. You will prophesy with them, and you will be completely changed into a different kind of man—one fit for the role of king.
1 Samuel 10:7 So when all these signs come to pass for you, act decisively and do whatever you find necessary to do, because the Lord is with you.
1 Samuel 10:8 Then you will go down to Gilgal before me—for I will indeed come down to meet you there—so that you may offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings. You must wait for seven days until I come to you, and then I will show you what you are to do.
1 Samuel 10:9 So when Saul turned to leave Samuel, God gave him a new heart—a changed inner disposition suitable for his new calling. And all these signs Samuel foretold came to pass on that very day.
1 Samuel 10:10 When Saul and his servant arrived at the hill, suddenly a company of prophets met him. The Spirit of the Lord powerfully rushed upon him, and he began to prophesy among them.
1 Samuel 10:11 All who had known Saul previously, recently or in the past, heard that he was prophesying with the prophets, and they said to one another in surprise: "What has happened to Kish’s son? Is Saul also among the prophets now?"
1 Samuel 10:12 Then one from the crowd answered and said, understanding the spiritual source of prophecy: "And who is the father of all prophets but God?" For this reason, it became a common proverb: "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
1 Samuel 10:13 When he finished prophesying, he went to the high place of worship.
1 Samuel 10:14 Saul's uncle then asked him and his servant: "Where did you go?" They answered: "We were looking for the donkeys. When we couldn't find them, we came to Samuel."
1 Samuel 10:15 Saul’s uncle said: "Tell me, what did Samuel say to you?"
1 Samuel 10:16 Saul replied to his uncle: "He merely told us that the donkeys had been found." But concerning the matter of the kingship, which Samuel had discussed with him, Saul did not tell his uncle anything.
1 Samuel 10:17 Then Samuel summoned all the people of Israel to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah.
1 Samuel 10:18 And he said to the children of Israel: "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'I myself brought Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms and those who oppressed you.'"
1 Samuel 10:19 "But today you have rejected your God—the very One who alone has saved you from all your troubles and distresses. Instead, you have said: 'No, we insist, set a king over us.' Therefore, now present yourselves before the Lord, arranged by your tribes and by your family units."
1 Samuel 10:20 So Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, and by the casting of lots, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.
1 Samuel 10:21 Then Samuel brought forward the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the lot fell on the Matrite family. Finally, by lot, Saul, the son of Kish, was chosen. But when they looked for him, he could not be found.
1 Samuel 10:22 So they further inquired of the Lord: "Will the man indeed come forward here?" The Lord answered: "Look, he is hiding among the baggage."
1 Samuel 10:23 So they ran and brought him out from there. When Saul stood among the people, he was taller than everyone else, from the shoulder upward, an imposing figure.
1 Samuel 10:24 Then Samuel said to all the people: "Do you not see the one whom the Lord has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people!" And all the people shouted with great acclaim, saying: "Long live the King!"
1 Samuel 10:25 Then Samuel spoke to the people about the rights and duties of the kingship, which he then wrote in a book and laid up before the Lord as a permanent record. After this, Samuel sent all the people away, each person returning to their own home.
1 Samuel 10:26 Saul also went home to Gibeah, and a company of men whose hearts God had touched went with him, becoming his loyal followers.
1 Samuel 10:27 But some worthless men—called "sons of Belial"—said: "How can this man save us?" They despised him and did not bring him customary gifts to honor him as king. However, Saul wisely pretended not to hear their insults.
1 Samuel 10:1 Then Samuel took a small flask of oil, poured it over Saul's head, and then kissed him, saying: "Look, the Lord has anointed you as prince over His own people, His inheritance."
1 Samuel 10:2 When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, in the territory of Benjamin, towards the south. They will say to you: 'The donkeys you went to search for have been found.' And behold, your father has found the donkeys, and he is worried about you both, and has stopped thinking about the donkeys.
1 Samuel 10:3 And when you have gone on from there, and passed further, and come to the oak of Tabor, three men will meet you there, going up to God at Bethel. One will be carrying three young goats, another, three loaves of bread, and another, a flask of wine.
1 Samuel 10:4 They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, and you shall take them from their hand.
1 Samuel 10:5 After this, you will come to the hill of God, where the Philistine garrison is located. And when you enter the city there, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place. Before them will be a psaltery, a drum, a flute, and a lyre, and they themselves will be prophesying.
1 Samuel 10:6 Then the Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them, and you will be changed into another man.
1 Samuel 10:7 Therefore, when these signs come to pass for you, do whatever your hand finds to do, because the Lord is with you.
1 Samuel 10:8 And you shall go down before me to Gilgal — for I myself will come down to you there — and you shall offer burnt offerings and sacrifices of peace offerings. You shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and I will show you what to do.
1 Samuel 10:9 So when he turned his back on him to depart, God changed his heart for him; and all these signs came to pass on that day.
1 Samuel 10:10 And they came to the hill, and behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he prophesied in their midst.
1 Samuel 10:11 All who knew him previously — for a long time — heard that he had prophesied with the prophets, and they said to one another: 'What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?'
1 Samuel 10:12 And one of the crowd responded, saying: 'And who is *their* father then?' — meaning, who are *those* prophets' fathers, that they should be prophets? — For this reason, it became a common saying: 'Is Saul also among the prophets?'
1 Samuel 10:13 And when he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.
1 Samuel 10:14 Then Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant boy: 'Where did you go?' They answered: 'To look for the donkeys. And when we couldn't find them, we came to Samuel.'
1 Samuel 10:15 And Saul’s uncle said: 'Tell me what Samuel said to you.'
1 Samuel 10:16 And Saul said to his uncle: 'He told us that the donkeys had been found.' But concerning the matter of the kingdom, he did not tell him what Samuel had said to him.
1 Samuel 10:17 Then Samuel called the people together to the Lord at Mizpah.
1 Samuel 10:18 And he said to the children of Israel: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'
1 Samuel 10:19 'But today you have rejected your God, who alone saved you from all your troubles and distresses. And you have said: "No, but set a king over us!" Now therefore, present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your thousands.'
1 Samuel 10:20 So Samuel brought forward all the tribes of Israel, and the lot fell to the tribe of Benjamin.
1 Samuel 10:21 Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin by its clans, and the lot fell to the clan of Matri. And it came down to Saul, the son of Kish. But they searched for him, and he could not be found.
1 Samuel 10:22 So they inquired further of the Lord, asking if the man had come there. And the Lord answered: 'Behold, he is hidden among the baggage.'
1 Samuel 10:23 So they ran and brought him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.
1 Samuel 10:24 And Samuel said to all the people: 'Do you see whom the Lord has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people?' Then all the people shouted and said: 'Long live the King!'
1 Samuel 10:25 Then Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of the kingdom, and he wrote it in a book and laid it up before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away, each man to his own home.
1 Samuel 10:26 But Saul also went home to Gibeah; and with him went valiant men, whose hearts God had touched.
1 Samuel 10:27 However, some wicked men said: 'How can this man save us?' And they despised him and brought him no presents. But he pretended not to hear.
1 Samuel 11:1 Nahash the Ammonite advanced and began to fight against Jabesh Gilead. Then all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash: "Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you."
1 Samuel 11:2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them: "I will make this covenant with you, but only if I may gouge out all of your right eyes, and make you a public disgrace in all of Israel."
1 Samuel 11:3 And the elders of Jabesh said to him: "Give us seven days so that we may send messengers throughout all the borders of Israel. And if there is no one who can defend us, then we will surrender to you."
1 Samuel 11:4 So the messengers came to Gibeah, the city of Saul, and spoke these words in the hearing of the people. And all the people raised their voice and wept.
1 Samuel 11:5 And behold, Saul was coming, following his oxen from the field. And he said: "What troubles the people, that they weep?" And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.
1 Samuel 11:6 And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger burned fiercely.
1 Samuel 11:7 And he took a pair of oxen and cut them into pieces, then sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying: "Whoever does not come out and follow Saul and Samuel, the same will be done to his oxen." And the fear of the Lord fell upon the people, and they came out as one man.
1 Samuel 11:8 And he counted them at Bezek. And the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand men, but the men of Judah were thirty thousand.
1 Samuel 11:9 And they said to the messengers who had come: "Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: 'Tomorrow, deliverance will be yours when the sun grows hot'"—meaning, after the morning attack. So the messengers came and announced it to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced.
1 Samuel 11:10 And the men of Jabesh said: "Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."
1 Samuel 11:11 And it happened on the next day: Saul divided the people into three companies, and they entered the midst of the Ammonite camp during the morning watch, and struck down the Ammonites until the day grew hot. But the remaining Ammonites were scattered, so that not two of them were left together.
1 Samuel 11:12 And the people said to Samuel: "Who is this who said: 'Saul shall not reign over us?' Give us those men, and we will put them to death."
1 Samuel 11:13 And Saul said: "No man shall be put to death this day, because today the Lord has worked deliverance in Israel."
1 Samuel 11:14 Then Samuel said to the people: "Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and there let us renew the kingdom."
1 Samuel 11:15 And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they anointed Saul as king before the Lord in Gilgal. And there they offered peace offerings before the Lord. And Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced there exceedingly.
1 Samuel 11:1 Nahash the Ammonite marched up and began to fight against Jabesh-Gilead. All the men of Jabesh then said to Nahash: 'Make a covenant with us, and we will be your servants.'
1 Samuel 11:2 Nahash the Ammonite answered them: 'I will make this covenant with you only on the condition that I gouge out every one of your right eyes, and so make you a disgrace throughout all of Israel.'
1 Samuel 11:3 The elders of Jabesh then said to Nahash: 'Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout all the territories of Israel. If no one comes to defend us, then we will surrender to you.'
1 Samuel 11:4 So the messengers came to Gibeah, Saul's city, and spoke these words in the hearing of the people. And all the people raised their voices and wept aloud because of the impending threat.
1 Samuel 11:5 And behold, Saul was coming back, following his oxen from the field. Saul asked: 'What troubles the people that they are weeping?' And they recounted to him the words of the messengers from Jabesh.
1 Samuel 11:6 Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon Saul when he heard these words, and his righteous anger burned fiercely.
1 Samuel 11:7 And he took a yoke of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent them throughout all the territories of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying: 'Whoever does not come out and follow Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen!' Then the fear of the Lord fell upon the people, and they came out as one unified force.
1 Samuel 11:8 And he mustered them at Bezek. There were three hundred thousand men from the northern tribes of Israel, and thirty thousand men from the tribe of Judah.
1 Samuel 11:9 And they said to the messengers who had come: 'Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead: "Tomorrow, when the sun grows hot, you will have deliverance and safety."' So the messengers came and reported this to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced greatly.
1 Samuel 11:10 Then the men of Jabesh said to the Ammonites, misleading them: 'Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do with us whatever you please.'
1 Samuel 11:11 And it came to pass on the next day: Saul arranged his army into three companies. They entered the middle of the Ammonite camp during the morning watch—the time just before dawn—and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who remained alive were so thoroughly scattered that not even two of them were left together.
1 Samuel 11:12 Then the people, emboldened by victory, said to Samuel: 'Who is it that said, "Saul shall not reign over us"? Hand them over to us, and we will put them to death!'
1 Samuel 11:13 But Saul, in his triumph, said: 'No man shall be put to death this day, for today the Lord has brought about this great deliverance and salvation for Israel.'
1 Samuel 11:14 Then Samuel said to the people: 'Come, let us go to Gilgal, a place of historical significance, and there let us publicly affirm the kingship.'
1 Samuel 11:15 So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they formally anointed Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal. And there they offered peace offerings before the Lord, a sign of their renewed covenant. Saul rejoiced there, and all the men of Israel rejoiced with him exceedingly.

1 Samuel 12:1 Samuel then addressed all of the people of Israel. He told them: 'I have heard all that you have asked me for, and I have set a king over you.'
1 Samuel 12:2 'And now the king leads you. As for me, I have grown old and grey, but my sons are still among you. I have lived my life among you, from my youth until this very day.'
1 Samuel 12:3 'Speak about me now before the Lord and before His anointed one, the king. Have I ever taken anyone's ox or donkey? Have I ever defrauded anyone or oppressed them? Have I ever taken a bribe from anyone and then ignored their case? If so, tell me, and I will restore it to you today.'
1 Samuel 12:4 They all replied: 'You have not defrauded us, nor have you oppressed us, nor have you taken anything from anyone's hand!'
1 Samuel 12:5 Then Samuel said to them: 'The Lord is a witness against you, and His anointed one is a witness today, that you have found nothing wrong in my conduct.' And they said: 'He is a witness!'
1 Samuel 12:6 Samuel then said to the people: 'The Lord, who made Moses and Aaron into leaders, is the same God who led our ancestors out of the land of Egypt.'
1 Samuel 12:7 'Therefore, stand now, so that I may contend with you in judgment before the Lord, concerning all the gracious deeds which the Lord performed for you and for your ancestors.'
1 Samuel 12:8 'Remember how Jacob went down into Egypt, and your ancestors cried out to the Lord? And the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, and they led your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place.'
1 Samuel 12:9 'But then they forgot the Lord their God. So He handed them over into the power of Sisara, the commander of the army of Hasor, and into the power of the Philistines, and into the power of the king of Moab, and these nations fought against them.'
1 Samuel 12:10 'Then your ancestors cried out to the Lord, saying: "We have sinned, for we have abandoned the Lord and served the Baalim and the Astaroth. Now therefore, deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You!"'
1 Samuel 12:11 'So the Lord sent Jerobaal, and Badan, and Jephte, and Samuel, and He delivered you from the hand of your enemies all around, and you lived in security.'
1 Samuel 12:12 'But when you saw that Naas, the king of the children of Ammon, was coming against you, you said to me: "No, we must have a king reign over us!" You said this even though the Lord your God was already your King!'
1 Samuel 12:13 'Now therefore, behold your king, whom you have chosen and for whom you have asked. Behold, the Lord has set a king over you.'
1 Samuel 12:14 'If you fear the Lord, and serve Him, and listen to His voice, and do not rebel against the command of the Lord, then both you and your king who rules over you will follow the Lord your God.'
1 Samuel 12:15 'But if you do not listen to the voice of the Lord, and if you rebel against the words of the Lord, then the hand of the Lord will be against you and against your ancestors —meaning the previous generation of kings and leaders.'
1 Samuel 12:16 'But now, stand still and see this great thing which the Lord is about to do before your eyes.'
1 Samuel 12:17 'Is it not the time of the wheat harvest today? This is a time of year when it does not rain. I will call upon the Lord, and He will send thunder and rain. And you will know and see that you have done great evil in the sight of the Lord by asking for a king for yourselves.'
1 Samuel 12:18 So Samuel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain on that very day. And all the people feared the Lord and Samuel greatly.
1 Samuel 12:19 And all the people said to Samuel: 'Pray for your servants to the Lord your God, so that we may not die! For we have added to all our other sins this evil, that we asked for a king for ourselves.'
1 Samuel 12:20 Samuel then said to the people: 'Do not be afraid! You have indeed done all this evil, but nevertheless, do not turn away from following the Lord. Instead, serve the Lord with all your heart.'
1 Samuel 12:21 'And do not turn aside after empty things, which will not profit you nor deliver you, for they are empty idols.'
1 Samuel 12:22 'For the Lord will not forsake His people for His great Name's sake. This is because the Lord has sworn to make you His own people.'
1 Samuel 12:23 'Far be it from me to commit this sin against the Lord, that I should cease to pray for you! And I will teach you the good and the right way.'
1 Samuel 12:24 'Therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him in truth and with all your heart. For you have seen how many great things He has done for you.'
1 Samuel 12:25 'But if you continue in wickedness, both you and your king will perish together.'
1 Samuel 13:1 Saul was in the first year of his effective reign when he began to rule, and he reigned for two years.
1 Samuel 13:2 And Saul chose for himself three thousand men from Israel. Two thousand of them were with Saul in Machmas and in the mountains of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin. The rest of the people, he sent each man back to his own tent.
1 Samuel 13:3 And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Gabaa. When the Philistines heard of it, Saul sounded the trumpet throughout all the land, saying: "Let the Hebrews hear this!"
1 Samuel 13:4 And all Israel heard such a report: "Saul has struck the garrison of the Philistines, and Israel has aroused the hatred of the Philistines." So the people were summoned to Saul in Galgala.
1 Samuel 13:5 Furthermore, the Philistines gathered to fight against Israel: thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand cavalry, and the rest of their common people were as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and encamped in Machmas, to the east of Bethaven.
1 Samuel 13:6 However, when the men of Israel saw that they were hard-pressed, and that the people were in distress, they hid themselves in caves, and in dense thickets, and among the rocks, and in hidden places, and in cisterns.
1 Samuel 13:7 Some of the Hebrews even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Galaad. While Saul was still in Galgala, all the people trembled in fear, following him.
1 Samuel 13:8 And Saul waited for seven days, according to the appointed time Samuel had established. But Samuel did not come to Galgala, and the people began to scatter from him.
1 Samuel 13:9 Therefore, Saul said: "Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings." And he offered the burnt offering.
1 Samuel 13:10 When he had just finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel was coming. And Saul went out to meet him to greet him.
1 Samuel 13:11 And Samuel said to him: "What have you done?" Saul answered: "Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and you had not come according to the appointed days, and the Philistines had gathered in Machmas,
1 Samuel 13:12 I said to myself: 'Now the Philistines will come down against me in Galgala, and I have not appeased the face of the Lord through prayer and sacrifice.' Therefore, I dared to transgress and offered the sacrifice."
1 Samuel 13:13 And Samuel said to Saul: "You have acted foolishly. You have not kept the commandments of the Lord your God, which He commanded you. For if you had not done this, the Lord would now have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
1 Samuel 13:14 But now, your kingdom will not last. The Lord has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the Lord has appointed him to be a leader over His people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded."
1 Samuel 13:15 And Samuel rose up and went from Galgala to Gabaa of Benjamin. And the rest of the people went up after Saul, who was meeting with the people that remained from among the strongest men.
1 Samuel 13:16 And Saul numbered the people who were found with him, about six hundred men.
1 Samuel 13:17 And a company of the Philistines went up to pass through the pass of Machmas.
1 Samuel 13:18 Now one part of them was in Bethoron, and another went to Ephra into the land of Sual, and the third went on towards the boundary above the valley of Oheb.
1 Samuel 13:19 There was not a single blacksmith to be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had ensured that the Hebrews would not be able to make a sword or a spear.
1 Samuel 13:20 Instead, all the men of Israel had to go down to the Philistines, so that each man could sharpen his plowshare, and his mattock, and his axe, and his hoe.
1 Samuel 13:21 And the edges of their plowshares, and mattocks, and three-pronged spears, and axes were dull. And they were sharpened by the Philistines' oxen goads.
1 Samuel 13:22 And when the day of battle arrived, no sword or spear was found in the hand of all the people who were with Saul and Jonathan, except for Saul and his son Jonathan.
1 Samuel 13:23 Now a garrison of the Philistines went out to cross over to Madian.
1 Samuel 14:1 Some days later, it happened that Jonathan, son of Saul, said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let us cross over to the Philistine outpost that is across the valley." Jonathan, however, did not wish to tell his father about this plan.
1 Samuel 14:2 Meanwhile, Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah, under a pomegranate tree in Migron. The men with him numbered about six hundred.
1 Samuel 14:3 Ahiah, son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of Eli, the Lord’s priest in Shiloh, was wearing the ephod. But even the people did not know where Jonathan had gone.
1 Samuel 14:4 There were two prominent rocky crags on either side of the pass Jonathan intended to use to cross over to the Philistine outpost. These jagged rocks looked like sharp teeth, steep on both sides. One was named Bozez, and the other Sene.
1 Samuel 14:5 One crag jutted out to the north, facing Michmas, and the other faced south, opposite Gibeah.
1 Samuel 14:6 Then Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised Philistines. Perhaps the Lord will act on our behalf. For it is not difficult for the Lord to bring salvation, whether by means of many soldiers or by only a few."
1 Samuel 14:7 And his armor-bearer said to him, "Do whatever seems good to you. Go wherever you wish, for I am with you, just as you desire."
1 Samuel 14:8 Then Jonathan said, "Look, we are crossing over to these men, and when we show ourselves to them,"
1 Samuel 14:9 "if they say to us, 'Wait until we come to you,' then we will stay where we are and not climb up to them."
1 Samuel 14:10 "But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will climb up, because that will be a sign for us that the Lord has delivered them into our hands."
1 Samuel 14:11 So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost, and the Philistines said, "Look! The Hebrews are coming out of the caves where they have been hiding!"
1 Samuel 14:12 Then the men of the outpost called out to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, saying, "Come up to us, and we will show you a thing or two!" Jonathan then said to his armor-bearer, "Follow me, for the Lord has delivered them into the hand of Israel."
1 Samuel 14:13 So Jonathan climbed up, using both his hands and his feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed those who were close behind him.
1 Samuel 14:14 In that first attack, Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed about twenty men in a very small area of land—roughly the space a yoke of oxen could plow in half a day.
1 Samuel 14:15 A great panic spread through the Philistine camp and across the fields. All the men who had gone out to plunder were stunned and fled, trembling with fear. Even the soldiers at the outpost and the raiders themselves were struck with terror.
1 Samuel 14:16 Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin saw that the Philistine multitude was routed and scattered, fleeing in every direction.
1 Samuel 14:17 Then Saul said to the people with him, "Check and see who among us has left." When they checked, they found that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
1 Samuel 14:18 Then Saul said to Ahiah, "Bring the Ark of God near." —For the Ark of God was with the children of Israel on that day.
1 Samuel 14:19 While Saul was still speaking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp grew louder and more intense. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand! Stop consulting the Ark!"
1 Samuel 14:20 Then Saul and all the people who were with him raised a war cry and rushed to the battle scene. There, they found the Philistines’ swords were turned against each other, and a very great slaughter was underway.
1 Samuel 14:21 Furthermore, the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines for some time—having even gone up with them into their camp—now turned back to join the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
1 Samuel 14:22 All the Israelites who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines were fleeing, joined them in the pursuit. So the number of fighting men grew to about ten thousand.
1 Samuel 14:23 Thus, the Lord saved Israel on that day. The battle, however, continued all the way to Beth-aven.
1 Samuel 14:24 The men of Israel were exhausted that day, because Saul had bound the people with an oath, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats any food before evening, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the people tasted any food.
1 Samuel 14:25 All the common people of the land came into a forest where there was wild honey on the ground.
1 Samuel 14:26 When the people entered the forest, they saw honey dripping everywhere, yet no one put a hand to his mouth to eat it, for the people feared the oath.
1 Samuel 14:27 Jonathan, however, had not heard when his father put the oath on the people. So he stretched out the end of the staff that was in his hand, dipped it into a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth. Immediately, his eyes brightened, and his strength returned.
1 Samuel 14:28 Then one of the people replied, "Your father solemnly bound the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats any food today!' That is why the people are so faint."
1 Samuel 14:29 Jonathan then said, "My father has brought trouble upon the land. See how my eyes brightened and my strength returned just because I tasted a little of this honey!"
1 Samuel 14:30 "How much greater a blow might have been struck against the Philistines if the people had been allowed to eat freely from the spoils they found, instead of being starved!"
1 Samuel 14:31 On that day, they struck down the Philistines from Michmas all the way to Aijalon. By then, the people were utterly exhausted.
1 Samuel 14:32 The people then rushed greedily for the spoils. They took sheep, oxen, and calves, slaughtered them directly on the ground, and ate the meat with the blood still in it—a violation of God’s Law.
1 Samuel 14:33 Then someone reported to Saul, "Look, the people are sinning against the Lord by eating meat with the blood still in it!" He replied, "You have transgressed! Roll a large stone here to me at once!"
1 Samuel 14:34 Saul then said, "Go out among the people and tell them, 'Each man is to bring his ox or his ram to me at once, and slaughter it here, and eat it. Do not sin against the Lord by eating meat with the blood still in it!'" So every one of the people brought his ox with his own hand to Saul and slaughtered it there.
1 Samuel 14:35 Saul also built an altar to the Lord. This was the first altar he built to the Lord.
1 Samuel 14:36 Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until morning, and let us not leave a single man among them." The people replied, "Do whatever seems good to you." But the priest said, "Let us come near to God here to inquire of Him."
1 Samuel 14:37 So Saul inquired of the Lord, "Shall I pursue the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But the Lord did not answer him on that day.
1 Samuel 14:38 Then Saul said, "Gather all the chiefs and leaders of the people here, and find out how this sin occurred today."
1 Samuel 14:39 He swore an oath, "As the Lord, the Savior of Israel, lives, if this sin was committed by my own son Jonathan, he must surely die without fail!" But none of the people answered him.
1 Samuel 14:40 Then he said to all Israel, "You stand on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side." The people responded to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."
1 Samuel 15:1 Samuel said to Saul: "The Lord sent me on a mission to anoint you as king over His people, Israel. Therefore, you must listen to the voice of the Lord now."
1 Samuel 15:2 "Thus says the Lord of Armies: 'I have carefully observed all that Amalek did to Israel, specifically how they ambushed and fought against them on their journey when they came up out of Egypt.'"
1 Samuel 15:3 "Now, therefore, go and attack Amalek. Utterly destroy everything they possess; do not spare them. You must kill every person—from man to woman, from small child to infant—and every animal—ox and sheep, camel and donkey."
1 Samuel 15:4 So Saul gave orders to the people and counted them all, numbering them carefully: there were two hundred thousand foot soldiers, and ten thousand men from the tribe of Judah.
1 Samuel 15:5 When Saul arrived at the city of Amalek, he set up an ambush in the wadi, the valley floor near the city.
1 Samuel 15:6 And Saul said to the Kenites: "Go now, depart, and separate yourselves from among the other Amalekites, so that I do not destroy you along with them. For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
1 Samuel 15:7 So Saul attacked Amalek from Havilah all the way to Shur, which lies opposite Egypt.
1 Samuel 15:8 He captured Agag, the king of Amalek, alive, but all the rest of the people he put to death with the edge of the sword.
1 Samuel 15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and they spared the best of the flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, and the finest garments, and the rams—indeed, everything that was valuable. They did not want to destroy these. However, all the worthless and weak animals, they did kill.
1 Samuel 15:10 Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying:
1 Samuel 15:11 "I am deeply grieved that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from me and has not carried out my commands." Samuel was greatly saddened by this news, and he cried out to the Lord all through the night.
1 Samuel 15:12 When Samuel rose early in the morning to go to Saul, people reported to Samuel, saying: "Saul went to Carmel, and there he set up a triumphal monument for himself. Then he turned back, passed on, and went down to Gilgal."
1 Samuel 15:13 When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, "May you be blessed by the Lord! I have carried out the Lord's command."
1 Samuel 15:14 But Samuel said, "Then what is this sound of sheep bleating in my ears, and the lowing of cattle that I hear?"
1 Samuel 15:15 Saul answered, "They brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and cattle to offer as sacrifices to the Lord your God. The rest we utterly destroyed."
1 Samuel 15:16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night." And Saul said to him, "Speak."
1 Samuel 15:17 And Samuel said: "Though you considered yourself small and insignificant in your own eyes, were you not made the leader of the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed you king over Israel."
1 Samuel 15:18 "And the Lord sent you on a mission, saying: 'Go and utterly destroy the sinful Amalekites, and fight against them until they are completely annihilated.'"
1 Samuel 15:19 "Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord? Instead, you turned to the plunder and did what was evil in the sight of the Lord!"
1 Samuel 15:20 Saul said to Samuel: "But I did obey the voice of the Lord! I went on the mission the Lord sent me on. I brought back Agag, the king of Amalek, and I utterly destroyed the Amalekites!"
1 Samuel 15:21 "But the people took from the spoil, from among the sheep and cattle, the very best of those things that were designated for utter destruction, with the intention of sacrificing them to the Lord your God in Gilgal."
1 Samuel 15:22 And Samuel said: "Does the Lord truly desire burnt offerings and sacrifices, rather than obedience to His voice? For indeed, to obey is better than to offer animal sacrifices, and to listen attentively is better than to offer the fat of rams."
1 Samuel 15:23 "For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and stubbornness is like the wickedness of idolatry. Therefore, because you have rejected the word and command of the Lord, the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel."
1 Samuel 15:24 Then Saul said to Samuel: "I have sinned, because I transgressed the command of the Lord and your instructions. I did this because I feared the people, and I listened to their voices more than to God's."
1 Samuel 15:25 "Now therefore, I beg you, forgive my sin and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord."
1 Samuel 15:26 And Samuel said to Saul: "I will not return with you, for you have rejected the command of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel."
1 Samuel 15:27 As Samuel turned to leave, Saul grabbed the edge of his robe, and it tore.
1 Samuel 15:28 And Samuel said to him: "Just as this robe is torn, the Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today, and He has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you."
1 Samuel 15:29 Furthermore, the Eternal and Victorious One in Israel does not lie, nor does He change His mind, for He is not a man who feels regret or alters His plans.
1 Samuel 15:30 And Saul said: "I have sinned. But please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God."
1 Samuel 15:31 So Samuel turned back and followed Saul, and Saul worshipped the Lord.
1 Samuel 15:32 Then Samuel said: "Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites." And Agag, who was very well-fed, was brought to him, and he was trembling. Agag said: "Surely the bitterness of death has passed now"—meaning he thought the danger was over.
1 Samuel 15:33 And Samuel said: "Just as your sword has made many women childless, so now your mother will be childless among women." Then Samuel cut Agag into pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
1 Samuel 15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel 15:35 Samuel never saw Saul again until the day of his death. However, Samuel continued to grieve deeply for Saul. And the Lord was sorrowful that He had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel 15:1 And Samuel said to Saul: "The Lord Himself sent me on a mission to anoint you as king over His people, Israel. Therefore, now listen to the voice of the Lord."
1 Samuel 15:2 The Lord of armies declares this: 'I have carefully recalled all that Amalec did to Israel, how he resisted him on the way when he came up out of Egypt.'
1 Samuel 15:3 'Now therefore go and attack Amalec, and utterly destroy all that belongs to him. Do not spare him, but put to death every person, from man to woman, from little child to nursing infant. Also put to death every ox and sheep, every camel and donkey.'
1 Samuel 15:4 So Saul summoned the people and counted them, as if they were lambs. There were two hundred thousand foot soldiers, and ten thousand men from Judah.
1 Samuel 15:5 And when Saul came to the city of Amalec, he set an ambush in the valley—along the dry riverbed.
1 Samuel 15:6 Then Saul said to the Kenites: 'Go, and depart from Amalec, lest by chance I should involve you with them in their destruction. For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.' So the Kenites departed from the midst of Amalec.
1 Samuel 15:7 Saul then attacked Amalec from Havilah all the way to Shur, which faces Egypt.
1 Samuel 15:8 And he seized Agag, the king of Amalec, alive. But he put all the ordinary people to death with the edge of the sword.
1 Samuel 15:9 But Saul and his people spared Agag, as well as the best of the flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, and the garments, and the rams—indeed, everything that was good and valuable. They did not want to utterly destroy these things. But everything that was vile and contemptible, that they utterly destroyed.
1 Samuel 15:10 Now the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying:
1 Samuel 15:11 'I regret that I made Saul king, because he has forsaken me and has not carried out my commands. Samuel was deeply saddened by this, and he cried out to the Lord all that night.
1 Samuel 15:12 When Samuel rose in the night to go to Saul in the morning, it was reported to Samuel, by someone, that Saul had come to Carmel, and had set up a triumphant arch for himself, and had then turned back and gone to Gilgal.
1 Samuel 15:13 So Samuel came to Saul. And Saul was offering a burnt offering to the Lord from the first-fruits of the spoil that he had brought back from Amalec.
1 Samuel 15:14 And Samuel said: "What then is this bleating of the flocks that echoes in my ears, and the lowing of the herds that I hear?"
1 Samuel 15:15 And Saul said: "They brought these things from Amalec. For the people spared the best sheep and cattle, so that they might be sacrificed to the Lord your God. The rest, however, we utterly destroyed."
1 Samuel 15:16 Then Samuel said to Saul: "Allow me, and I will declare to you what the Lord has spoken to me during the night." And Saul said to him: "Speak."
1 Samuel 15:17 And Samuel said: "Although you may have been small in your own estimation, were you not made the head over the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed you king over Israel.
1 Samuel 15:18 And the Lord sent you on a journey and said: 'Go and put to death the sinners of Amalec, and you shall fight against them until their complete destruction.'
1 Samuel 15:19 Why then did you not listen to the voice of the Lord? Instead, you turned to plunder and did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord.
1 Samuel 15:20 And Saul said to Samuel: "Indeed, I did listen to the voice of the Lord. I walked in the way by which the Lord sent me, and I brought back Agag, the king of Amalec, and I utterly destroyed Amalec.
1 Samuel 15:21 But the people took from the spoils some sheep and cattle, the very best of those that were to be slain, in order to sacrifice them to the Lord your God in Gilgal."
1 Samuel 15:22 But Samuel said: "Does the Lord desire burnt offerings and sacrifices, and not rather that His voice be obeyed? Truly, to obey is better than to offer sacrifices, and to listen is better than to offer the fat of rams.
1 Samuel 15:23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and stubbornness is like the wickedness of idolatry. Therefore, because you have rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord has also rejected you from being king over Israel."
1 Samuel 15:24 Then Saul said to Samuel: "I have sinned, because I have violated the command of the Lord and your words, fearing the people and obeying their voice."
1 Samuel 15:25 "Now therefore, I beg you, forgive my sin, and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord."
1 Samuel 15:26 And Samuel said to Saul: "I will not return with you, because you have cast aside the word of the Lord, and the Lord has cast you aside from being king over Israel."
1 Samuel 15:27 And as Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the edge of his cloak, and it tore.
1 Samuel 15:28 And Samuel said to him: "The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you."
1 Samuel 15:29 Furthermore, the Victorious One in Israel—that is, God—will not relent, and will not be swayed by repentance. For He is not a man that He should be swayed by repentance.
1 Samuel 15:30 And Saul said: "I have sinned. But honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God."
1 Samuel 15:31 So Samuel returned and followed Saul, and Saul worshipped the Lord.
1 Samuel 15:32 And Samuel said: "Bring Agag, the king of Amalec, to me." And Agag was brought to him—Agag was very fat and trembling, and he said: "Surely the bitterness of death is now past?"
1 Samuel 15:33 And Samuel said: "Just as your sword made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women." And Samuel cut Agag into pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
1 Samuel 15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah. But Saul went up to his own house in Gibeah of Saul.
1 Samuel 15:35 And Samuel never saw Saul again until the day of his death. Nevertheless, Samuel mourned for Saul, and the Lord regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.
1 Samuel 16:1 The Lord then said to Samuel: "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have already rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and come, so I may send you to Jesse, the man from Bethlehem. For I have prepared a king for Myself among his sons."
1 Samuel 16:2 Samuel replied: "How can I go? For Saul will hear about it and will kill me." The Lord answered: "Take a calf from the herd with you in your hand, and say: 'I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord.'"
1 Samuel 16:3 And invite Jesse to the sacrifice. Then I will show you what you must do, and you shall anoint the one whom I point out to you.
1 Samuel 16:4 So Samuel did exactly as the Lord had told him. He arrived in Bethlehem. The elders of the city were astonished at his coming; they hurried to meet him and asked: "Is your arrival for peace?"
1 Samuel 16:5 Samuel said: "Yes, it is for peace. I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves and come with me so I may perform the sacrifice." So he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.
1 Samuel 16:6 When they had entered, Samuel saw Eliab. And Samuel thought to himself: "Surely this is the Lord's Anointed One, standing here before the Lord."
1 Samuel 16:7 But the Lord said to Samuel: "Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For I do not judge according to what a human judges: a human sees what is visible, but the Lord looks at the heart."
1 Samuel 16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and brought him before Samuel. But Samuel said: "The Lord has not chosen this one either."
1 Samuel 16:9 Next, Jesse brought Shamma. And Samuel said: "The Lord has not chosen this one either."
1 Samuel 16:10 So Jesse brought seven of his sons before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse: "The Lord has not chosen any of these."
1 Samuel 16:11 Then Samuel asked Jesse: "Are all your sons here?" Jesse answered: "There is still the youngest one left, and he is tending the sheep." Samuel said to Jesse: "Send for him and bring him here, because we will not sit down to eat until he comes."
1 Samuel 16:12 So Jesse sent for him and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome face. And the Lord said: "Arise, anoint him, for this is he."
1 Samuel 16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers. And the Spirit of the Lord was powerfully present with David from that day forward. Then Samuel arose and went back to Ramah.
1 Samuel 16:14 Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit tormented him, sent by the Lord to afflict him.
1 Samuel 16:15 Saul's servants said to him: "Behold, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you."
1 Samuel 16:16 "Let our lord command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is skilled at playing the lyre, so that when the evil spirit from God seizes you, he may play with his hand, and you may find relief."
1 Samuel 16:17 Saul said to his servants: "Then provide me with a man who plays well, and bring him to me."
1 Samuel 16:18 Then one of the young men answered and said: "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilled in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a warrior, and prudent in speech, and a handsome man. And the Lord is with him."
1 Samuel 16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse, saying: "Send me David your son, who is with the sheep in the pastures."
1 Samuel 16:20 Then Jesse took a donkey laden with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by the hand of David his son to Saul, as a gift.
1 Samuel 16:21 So David came to Saul and stood before him. Saul loved him dearly, and David became his armor-bearer.
1 Samuel 16:22 Saul then sent word to Jesse, saying: "Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my eyes."
1 Samuel 16:23 Therefore, whenever the evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul, David would take up his lyre and play with his hand. Then Saul would be refreshed and feel better, for the evil spirit would leave him.
1 Samuel 16:1 And the Lord said to Samuel: 'How long will you mourn for Saul? —I have already rejected him from reigning over Israel. Fill your anointing horn with oil, and come, so that I may send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen for myself a king from among his sons.'
1 Samuel 16:2 And Samuel said: 'How can I go? For Saul will hear of it, and he will kill me.' And the Lord said: 'Take a young heifer from the herd with you in your hand, and say: 'I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord.''
1 Samuel 16:3 And you shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint the one whom I show you.
1 Samuel 16:4 So Samuel did as the Lord commanded him. And he came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city were astonished. They came to meet him and asked: 'Is your coming peaceful?'
1 Samuel 16:5 And he said: 'It is peaceful. I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord. Purify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice' —this involves ritual cleansing. So Jesse purified himself and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.
1 Samuel 16:6 When they came in, Samuel saw Eliab and thought: 'Surely the Lord's Anointed is before Him!' —Samuel initially judged by outward appearance.
1 Samuel 16:7 But the Lord said to Samuel: 'Do not look at his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. I do not judge as man judges. For man sees what is visible, but the Lord sees the heart.'
1 Samuel 16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and brought him before Samuel. And Samuel said: 'The Lord has not chosen this one either.'
1 Samuel 16:9 Then Jesse brought Shammah, of whom Samuel said: 'The Lord has not chosen this one either.'
1 Samuel 16:10 So Jesse brought his seven sons before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse: 'The Lord has not chosen any of these.'
1 Samuel 16:11 Then Samuel said to Jesse: 'Are these all your sons who remain?' And Jesse replied: 'There still remains the youngest, and he is tending the sheep.' And Samuel said to Jesse: 'Send for him and bring him here, for we will not sit down to eat until he comes here.'
1 Samuel 16:12 So Jesse sent and brought him in. He was reddish, with beautiful eyes, and a handsome appearance. And the Lord said: 'Arise, anoint him, for this is the one.'
1 Samuel 16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers. And the Spirit of the Lord came upon David mightily from that day forward. Then Samuel arose and went to Ramah.
1 Samuel 16:14 Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit sent by the Lord tormented him —this doesn't imply God is evil but rather that He allowed or ordained this affliction as a consequence of Saul's disobedience.
1 Samuel 16:15 And Saul's servants said to him: 'Behold, an evil spirit from the Lord is tormenting you.'
1 Samuel 16:16 'Let our lord command, and your servants will search for someone who can play the lyre well. Then, when the evil spirit from the Lord takes hold of you, he can play with his hand, and you will be relieved' —the music would soothe and distract, perhaps creating a more peaceful internal state.
1 Samuel 16:17 And Saul said to his servants: 'Find me now someone who plays well, and bring him to me.'
1 Samuel 16:18 Then one of the young men answered and said: 'Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilled in playing the lyre, and he is a mighty warrior, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a handsome man. And the Lord is with him' —this is high praise, acknowledging David's diverse talents and God's favor.
1 Samuel 16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse, saying: 'Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.'
1 Samuel 16:20 So Jesse took an ass loaded with bread, and a flask of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by the hand of David his son to Saul —these were gifts appropriate for a vassal presenting his son to a king.
1 Samuel 16:21 And David came to Saul and stood before him. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer —this was an important position of trust and proximity to the king.
1 Samuel 16:22 And Saul sent word to Jesse, saying: 'Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight' —meaning, he has pleased me or I am pleased with him.
1 Samuel 16:23 Therefore, whenever the evil spirit from the Lord seized Saul, David would take his lyre and play it with his hand. Then Saul would be refreshed and feel better, for the evil spirit would depart from him.
1 Samuel 16:24 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle. They assembled at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and they encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
1 Samuel 16:25 Saul and the men of Israel assembled and came to the Valley of Elah, and they drew up their battle line against the Philistines.
1 Samuel 16:26 The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side. And there was a valley between them.
1 Samuel 16:27 Then a champion came out of the Philistine camp, named Goliath, from Gath. His height was six cubits and a span —approximately nine feet nine inches tall.
1 Samuel 16:28 He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he was clothed with a scale-armor breastplate. The weight of his breastplate was five thousand shekels of bronze —approximately one hundred and twenty-five pounds of bronze.
1 Samuel 16:29 And he had bronze greaves on his legs, and a bronze shield was carried between his shoulders.
1 Samuel 16:30 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spearhead weighed six hundred shekels of iron —approximately fifteen pounds. And his armor-bearer went before him.
1 Samuel 16:31 Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them: 'Why have you come out and drawn up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me for single combat!'
1 Samuel 16:32 'If he is able to fight with me and defeat me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail and defeat him, then you will be our servants, and you will serve us.'
1 Samuel 16:33 And the Philistine said: 'I have defied the armies of Israel today! Give me a man, that we may fight in single combat!'
1 Samuel 16:34 When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid —the challenge was terrifying due to Goliath's immense size and weaponry.
1 Samuel 16:35 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite man from Bethlehem in Judah. His name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And in the days of Saul, the man Jesse was old and well advanced in years among men —this clarifies Jesse's age and prominence in his community.
1 Samuel 16:36 And Jesse's three oldest sons had gone after Saul to the battle. Their names were: the firstborn Eliab, the second Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
1 Samuel 16:37 David was the youngest. So while the three oldest followed Saul,
1 Samuel 16:38 David had gone away and returned from Saul's service. He went back to feed his father's flock in Bethlehem —this explains why David was not immediately present at the battle, indicating a period of time has passed.
1 Samuel 16:39 And the Philistine came forward morning and evening. He stood challenging for forty days —this emphasizes the prolonged terror and the immense pressure on the Israelite army.
1 Samuel 16:40 Then Jesse said to David his son: 'Take for your brothers this ephah of roasted grain, and these ten loaves of bread. And hurry to the camp to your brothers.'
1 Samuel 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle. They assembled at Socho in Judah, and they set up their camp between Socho and Azeca, in the territory of Ephesdammim.
1 Samuel 17:2 But Saul and the men of Israel gathered together. They came to the Valley of Terebinth and set up their camp opposite the Philistines.
1 Samuel 17:3 The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side. A valley was between them.
1 Samuel 17:4 Then a mighty warrior came out from the Philistine camp, whose name was Goliath, from Gath. He was six cubits and a palm in height—an incredible height for a man.
1 Samuel 17:5 A bronze helmet was on his head, and he wore a coat of scaled armor. The weight of his armor was five thousand shekels of bronze.
1 Samuel 17:6 Bronze greaves were on his legs, and a bronze shield protected his shoulders.
1 Samuel 17:7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spearhead weighed six hundred shekels of iron. His shield-bearer walked before him.
1 Samuel 17:8 He stood and shouted at the battle lines of Israel, saying to them: "Why have you come out prepared for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man from among yourselves, and let him come down for single combat."
1 Samuel 17:9 "If he can fight with me and defeat me, then we will be your servants. But if I overpower him and defeat him, then you will be our servants and you will serve us."
1 Samuel 17:10 And the Philistine added: "I have defied the armies of Israel today! Give me a man, and I will enter into single combat with him!"
1 Samuel 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they were greatly troubled and became very afraid.
1 Samuel 17:12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite man from Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse. Jesse had eight sons. And during the time of Saul, this man was old and advanced in years among men.
1 Samuel 17:13 And Jesse's three eldest sons had gone to battle with Saul. Their names were: the firstborn Amnadab, the second Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
1 Samuel 17:14 But David was the youngest. So the three eldest had followed Saul.
1 Samuel 17:15 David had gone and returned from Saul to tend his father's flock in Bethlehem.
1 Samuel 17:16 The Philistine came forward morning and evening. And he stood there for forty days, challenging them daily.
1 Samuel 17:17 Now Jesse said to his son David: "Take this ephah of parched grain for your brothers, and these ten loaves of bread. And hurry to the camp, to your brothers."
1 Samuel 17:18 "And these ten cheeses you shall bring to the commander (tribune). And visit your brothers, see how they are doing, and bring back word from them."
1 Samuel 17:19 Now Saul, and his men, and all the men of Israel, were in the Valley of Terebinth, engaged in war against the Philistines.
1 Samuel 17:20 So David rose early in the morning, leaving the flock with a keeper for his father. And taking the provisions, he went as Jesse had commanded him. He arrived at the camp just as the army was going out to the battle line and shouting the war cry.
1 Samuel 17:21 And Israel and the Philistines had drawn up their battle lines, arrayed line against line.
1 Samuel 17:22 David left the things he had brought in the care of the baggage keeper. He ran to the battle line and asked his brothers how they were doing.
1 Samuel 17:23 While he was still speaking, behold, that mighty warrior named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, was coming up from the Philistine camp. And he spoke according to his previous words, and David heard him.
1 Samuel 17:24 Now all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from his presence and were greatly afraid.
1 Samuel 17:25 And everyone said to his neighbor: "Have you seen this man who has come up? He has certainly come up to defy Israel. The man who strikes him down will be greatly enriched by the king, and the king will give him his daughter, and he will make his father's house free from tribute in Israel."
1 Samuel 17:26 And David said to the men who stood by him, saying: "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, who has defied the armies of the living God? And what will be the reward for the man who strikes him down and removes this disgrace from Israel?"
1 Samuel 17:27 And the people repeated to him the former words, saying: "These things will be given to the man who strikes him down."
1 Samuel 17:28 Now Amnadab, his eldest brother, heard him speaking to the others. And he became angry with David, and he said: "Why have you come down here? And to whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the wickedness of your heart, because you have come down only to see the battle."
1 Samuel 17:29 And David said: "What have I done now? Was it not just a question?"
1 Samuel 17:30 And he turned away from Amnadab and spoke to another man with the same question as before. And the people gave him the same answer as before.
1 Samuel 17:31 Now the words which David spoke were heard. And they were reported in the presence of Saul. And when Saul heard, he sent for him.
1 Samuel 17:32 And David said to Saul: "Let no one's heart fail because of this. I, your servant, will go and fight against this Philistine."
1 Samuel 17:33 And Saul said to David: "You are not able to stand against this Philistine, nor to fight against him. For you are but a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth."
1 Samuel 17:34 And David said to Saul: "Your servant was tending his father's flock as a shepherd. And when a lion or a bear came and carried off a ram from the middle of the flock,"
1 Samuel 17:35 "I would pursue it and strike it down, and rescue the ram from its mouth. And if it rose up against me, I would seize its jaw, and choke it, and kill it."
1 Samuel 17:36 "Indeed, your servant has killed both a lion and a bear. Therefore, this uncircumcised Philistine I will destroy just like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God."
1 Samuel 17:37 And David added: "The Lord, who rescued me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He himself will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine." And Saul said to David: "Go, and may the Lord be with you."
1 Samuel 17:38 And Saul clothed David with his own garments. And he put a bronze helmet on his head, and he clothed him with a coat of mail.
1 Samuel 17:39 And David girded his sword over his garments. He began to try walking, for he was not accustomed to it. And David said to Saul: "I cannot go with these, for I am not accustomed to them." And he took them off.
1 Samuel 17:40 And he took his staff, which he always held in his hands. And he chose for himself five smooth stones from the stream. And he put them in his shepherd's bag which he had with him. And he held his sling in his hand, and he went forward against the Philistine.
1 Samuel 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for war. They assembled in Socco of Judah, setting up their camp between Socco and Azeca, in a place called Ephes Dammim.
1 Samuel 17:2 Saul and the men of Israel also gathered. They came to the Valley of Terebinth and arranged their battle lines, preparing to fight against the Philistines.
1 Samuel 17:3 The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and the Israelites stood on a mountain on the other side, with a valley separating them.
1 Samuel 17:4 Then a special champion warrior came out of the Philistine camp. His name was Goliath, and he was from the city of Gath. He was an enormous man, measuring six cubits and a palm in height—a massive giant.
1 Samuel 17:5 He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he wore a coat of scale-armor made of bronze, which weighed five thousand shekels of bronze.
1 Samuel 17:6 He wore bronze greaves on his legs, and a bronze buckler shield was on his shoulders.
1 Samuel 17:7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the iron head of his spear weighed six hundred shekels of iron. His shield-bearer walked ahead of him.
1 Samuel 17:8 Goliath stood and shouted to the Israelite battle lines, saying, “Why have you come out to prepare for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man from among yourselves to come down and fight me in single combat.”
1 Samuel 17:9 He continued, “If he can fight against me and defeat me, then we will be your servants. But if I overcome him and defeat him, then you will be our servants and serve us.”
1 Samuel 17:10 The Philistine also added, “I have openly defied the Israelite armies today! Give me a man, and let us fight each other!”
1 Samuel 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they were terrified, and they greatly feared him.
1 Samuel 17:12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite man from Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse. Jesse had eight sons, and he himself was an old man, advanced in years among men.
1 Samuel 17:13 Jesse’s three oldest sons had gone with Saul to the battle. Their names were Eliab, the firstborn; Abinadab, the second; and Shamma, the third.
1 Samuel 17:14 David was the youngest. So while the three oldest sons followed Saul to battle,
1 Samuel 17:15 David had left the military service and returned from Saul’s camp to shepherd his father’s flock in Bethlehem.
1 Samuel 17:16 The Philistine champion, Goliath, would come forward every morning and evening. He took his stand and issued his challenge for forty days.
1 Samuel 17:17 Then Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers. Hurry and bring them to your brothers in the camp.”
1 Samuel 17:18 He continued, “Also, take these ten cheeses to the captain. See how your brothers are doing, and bring back a report of their welfare and what is happening there.”
1 Samuel 17:19 Now Saul, and Jesse's sons, and all the men of Israel, were in the Valley of Terebinth, fighting against the Philistines.
1 Samuel 17:20 So David got up early in the morning. He left the flock with a keeper and, laden with supplies, went as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the camp, just as the army was going out to the battle line and shouting the battle cry.
1 Samuel 17:21 Both Israel and the Philistines had drawn up their battle lines, arrayed against each other.
1 Samuel 17:22 David left his baggage, which was his responsibility, with the keeper of the supplies. He then ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers if everything was well with them.
1 Samuel 17:23 While he was still speaking with them, the champion warrior appeared. It was Goliath by name, the Philistine from Gath, emerging from the Philistine battle line. He spoke the very same defiant words as before, and David heard them.
1 Samuel 17:24 All the Israelites who saw the man fled from his presence, fearing him greatly.
1 Samuel 17:25 And each one said to his neighbor, “Have you seen this man who has come up? He has come up to defy Israel. The king has promised to greatly enrich the man who defeats him, give him his daughter in marriage, and make his father’s house exempt from taxes in Israel.”
1 Samuel 17:26 David then said to the men standing with him, “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine who dares to defy the armies of the living God?”
1 Samuel 17:27 The people repeated the same words to him, saying, “This is what the king will do for the man who defeats him.”
1 Samuel 17:28 Now Eliab, his oldest brother, heard him speaking to the others. Eliab’s anger burned against David, and he said, “Why have you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil intention of your heart, for you have come down only to see the battle!”
1 Samuel 17:29 David replied, “What have I done now? Was it not just a question?”
1 Samuel 17:30 He turned away from Eliab and asked another man. He spoke according to the same question, and the people answered him as they had before.
1 Samuel 17:31 When David’s words were heard, they were reported to Saul. And when Saul heard about them, he sent for David.
1 Samuel 17:32 David said to Saul, “Let no man’s courage fail because of this giant. I, your servant, will go and fight against this Philistine.”
1 Samuel 17:33 Saul said to David, “You are not strong enough to stand against this Philistine or fight against him. You are just a youth, while he has been a warrior since his adolescence.”
1 Samuel 17:34 David replied to Saul, “I was my father’s shepherd of the flock. When a lion or a bear came and snatched a lamb from the middle of the flock,
1 Samuel 17:35 I pursued it, attacked it, and rescued the lamb from its mouth. If it rose up against me, I would grab its jaw, strike it, and kill it.
1 Samuel 17:36 Indeed, I have killed both a lion and a bear. This uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them! Let him go and take away the defiance from Israel, because who is this uncircumcised man who dares to curse the army of the living God?”
1 Samuel 17:37 David also added, “The Lord, who rescued me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He Himself will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and may the Lord be with you.”
1 Samuel 17:38 Then Saul dressed David in his own armor. He placed a bronze helmet on David’s head and clothed him with a coat of mail.
1 Samuel 17:39 David buckled Saul’s sword over his own clothes and tried to walk, but he found he could not, because he had never worn such things before. So David said to Saul, “I cannot walk in these, for I am not accustomed to them.” And he took them off.
1 Samuel 17:40 Then he took his staff, which he always carried in his hand. He chose five smooth stones from the stream bed and put them in his shepherd’s bag, which he had with him, and his sling was in his hand. And so he went forward against the Philistine.
1 Samuel 18:1 It came to pass that when David finished speaking with Saul, Jonathan’s soul was bound to David’s soul, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
1 Samuel 18:2 Saul took David into his service that day and no longer allowed him to return to his father’s house.
1 Samuel 18:3 So Jonathan and David made a covenant of friendship, for Jonathan loved David as his own soul.
1 Samuel 18:4 And Jonathan took off the cloak he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his other garments, even his sword, bow, and belt.
1 Samuel 18:5 Moreover, David went out wherever Saul sent him, and he acted wisely. So Saul placed him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the eyes of all the people, and in the eyes of Saul’s servants.
1 Samuel 18:6 When David returned after killing the Philistine, the women came out from all the cities of Israel, singing in choruses and rejoicing to meet King Saul, with tambourines and musical instruments.
1 Samuel 18:7 And the women sang playfully, saying: 'Saul has struck down a thousand, and David ten thousand!'
1 Samuel 18:8 But Saul was exceedingly angry, and this saying displeased him. And he said: 'They have given David ten thousand, and to me they have given only a thousand. What more is left for him to have, except the kingdom itself?'
1 Samuel 18:9 Therefore, Saul suspected David from that day forward.
1 Samuel 18:10 But on the next day, an evil spirit from the Lord seized Saul, and he raved inside his house. David, meanwhile, played the lyre with his hand as he did every day, and a spear was in Saul’s hand.
1 Samuel 18:11 And Saul threw the spear, thinking and saying: 'I will pin David to the wall!' But David dodged away from him twice.
1 Samuel 18:12 And Saul feared David, because the Lord was with him, and had departed from Saul.
1 Samuel 18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from his presence and made him a tribune and commander over a thousand men. And David went out and came in before the people.
1 Samuel 18:14 In all his ways, David conducted himself wisely, and the Lord was with him.
1 Samuel 18:15 So Saul saw that David conducted himself very wisely, and he began to fear him greatly.
1 Samuel 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
1 Samuel 18:17 Then Saul said to David: 'Behold, my elder daughter Merob, I will give her to you as a wife. Only be a strong man and fight the Lord’s battles.' Saul, however, was thinking, saying: 'Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.'
1 Samuel 18:18 And David said to Saul: 'Who am I? Or what is my life? Or what is my father’s family in Israel, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?'
1 Samuel 18:19 But it came to pass that at the time when Merob, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was instead given to Hadriel the Meholathite as his wife.
1 Samuel 18:20 Now Michol, Saul’s other daughter, loved David. And it was reported to Saul, and it pleased him.
1 Samuel 18:21 And Saul said: 'I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.' So Saul said to David: 'You shall be my son-in-law a second time!'
1 Samuel 18:22 And Saul commanded his servants: 'Speak to David in secret, saying: "Behold, the king loves you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, you can become the king’s son-in-law!"'
1 Samuel 18:23 And Saul’s servants spoke these words in David’s ears. And David said: 'Does it seem a small thing to you to be the king’s son-in-law? Yet I am a poor and humble man.'
1 Samuel 18:24 And Saul’s servants reported to him, saying: 'This is what David has said.'
1 Samuel 18:25 And Saul said: 'Speak thus to David: "The king desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, so that there may be vengeance against the king’s enemies."' But Saul was thinking to deliver David into the hands of the Philistines.
1 Samuel 18:26 When his servants reported to David the words that Saul had spoken, the offer pleased David, so that he might become the king’s son-in-law. And the days appointed for the dowry had not yet passed.
1 Samuel 18:27 So David arose and went with his men, and he struck down two hundred men from the Philistines. And he brought their foreskins and counted them out to the king, so that he might become the king’s son-in-law. Therefore, Saul gave him Michol his daughter as a wife.
1 Samuel 18:28 And Saul saw and understood that the Lord was with David, and that Michol, Saul’s daughter, truly loved him.
1 Samuel 18:29 And Saul increased his fear of David even more. And Saul became an enemy of David all his days.
1 Samuel 18:30 And the princes of the Philistines went out to battle. And as often as they went out, David conducted himself more wisely than all of Saul’s servants, and his name became exceedingly famous.
1 Samuel 19:1 Now King Saul spoke to his son Jonathan and to all his personal attendants, giving them orders to kill David.
1 Samuel 19:2 But Jonathan, King Saul’s son, truly loved David. So Jonathan told David, saying, 'My father Saul is trying to kill you. So be careful tomorrow morning. You must stay hidden and conceal yourself.
1 Samuel 19:3 I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are hiding. I will speak to my father about you, and whatever I find out, I will tell you.'
1 Samuel 19:4 So Jonathan spoke good things about David to his father Saul. He said to the king, 'Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you. In fact, his actions have been very beneficial to you.
1 Samuel 19:5 He risked his own life and struck down the Philistine giant, Goliath. Through him, the Lord granted a great victory to all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then would you sin by shedding innocent blood, by killing David, who is without fault?'
1 Samuel 19:6 When Saul heard Jonathan’s words, he swore an oath, saying, 'As the Lord lives, David will not be killed.'
1 Samuel 19:7 So Jonathan called David and told him all these things. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and David was in Saul’s presence again, just as he had been before, for the past several days.
1 Samuel 19:8 Then war broke out again. David went out and fought against the Philistines. He struck them with a great defeat, and they fled from his presence.
1 Samuel 19:9 But an evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul while he was sitting in his house with his spear ready in his hand. David was playing music with his hand (the lyre).
1 Samuel 19:10 Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear. But David dodged Saul, and the spear struck the wall. David fled and escaped that very night.
1 Samuel 19:11 Saul sent his executioners to David’s house to keep watch over him and kill him in the morning. But David’s wife Michol told him, saying, 'Unless you save yourself tonight, tomorrow morning you will die.'
1 Samuel 19:12 So Michol let David down through a window. He left immediately, fled, and escaped.
1 Samuel 19:13 Now Michol took a household idol (a teraphim), placed it on the bed, put goat’s hair at its head, and covered it with a cloak.
1 Samuel 19:14 When Saul sent his messengers to seize David, they were told, 'He is sick.'
1 Samuel 19:15 Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, 'Bring him up to me on the bed, so that he may be killed.'
1 Samuel 19:16 When the messengers came in, behold, there was the idol on the bed, with the goat’s hair at its head.
1 Samuel 19:17 Then Saul said to Michol, 'Why have you deceived me in this way, and let my enemy escape?' Michol answered Saul, 'Because he himself threatened me, saying: 'Let me go, or I will kill you.''
1 Samuel 19:18 So David fled and was saved. He came to Samuel in Ramatha and told him everything that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed in Najoth.
1 Samuel 19:19 It was reported to Saul, saying, 'Behold, David is in Najoth in Ramatha.'
1 Samuel 19:20 So Saul sent his executioners to seize David. When they saw the company of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul’s executioners as well, and they too began to prophesy.
1 Samuel 19:21 When this was reported to Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also began to prophesy. Even more angered, Saul sent a third group of messengers, and they too began to prophesy.
1 Samuel 19:22 So Saul himself went to Ramatha and came as far as the great well that is in Socho. He asked, saying, 'Where are Samuel and David?' And he was told, 'Behold, they are in Najoth in Ramatha.'
1 Samuel 19:23 And as he went on to Najoth in Ramatha, the Spirit of God came upon him too, and he walked on, prophesying, until he arrived in Najoth in Ramatha.
1 Samuel 19:24 He even stripped off his own garments and prophesied with the others before Samuel. He lay there unclothed for that entire day and night. That is why the proverb came about: 'Is Saul also among the prophets?'
1 Samuel 19:2 But Jonathan, King Saul’s son, loved David very much. So Jonathan secretly sent word to David, saying: “My father, King Saul, is seeking to kill you. Therefore, I beg you, be on your guard tomorrow morning. You must go into hiding, and remain concealed.”
1 Samuel 19:3 “And I myself will go out and stand beside my father in the open field, wherever he may happen to be. I will speak to my father about you, and whatever I discover, I will report back to you immediately.”
1 Samuel 19:4 So Jonathan spoke well of David to his father, King Saul. He pleaded with him, saying: “Let not the king commit a sin against his own faithful servant David. For David has committed no sin against you, and indeed, his deeds have been very beneficial to you.”
1 Samuel 19:5 “David risked his very life and went into battle, striking down the Philistine giant. By his hand, the Lord brought about a great victory for all of Israel. You saw it then, and you greatly rejoiced. Why then would you sin against innocent blood, and kill David, who is truly without fault?”
1 Samuel 19:6 King Saul listened to the earnest plea of Jonathan. And so King Saul swore an oath, declaring: “As the Lord lives, David shall not be put to death.”
1 Samuel 19:7 Then Jonathan called David, and told him all of these words. And Jonathan brought David to King Saul, and David remained in his presence, serving him just as he had done on previous days.
1 Samuel 19:8 Then war broke out yet again. So David went out and fought against the Philistines, striking them down with such a devastating blow that they fled in terror from his presence.
1 Samuel 19:9 And then, again, an evil spirit from the Lord troubled King Saul. He was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, while David was playing his lyre and singing hymns to soothe him.
1 Samuel 19:10 King Saul sought to pin David to the wall with his spear. But David quickly moved away from Saul’s presence, and Saul’s spear struck the wall instead. David immediately fled, and he was saved from death that very night.
1 Samuel 19:11 So King Saul sent his messengers to David’s house to keep watch over him through the night, intending to kill him in the morning. David’s wife, Michal, secretly informed him, saying: “Unless you make your escape this very night, you will surely be dead by tomorrow.”
1 Samuel 19:12 So Michal helped David escape by letting him down through a window. He immediately departed, fled for his life, and managed to escape.
1 Samuel 19:13 Michal then took a household idol, a *teraphim*, and placed it on the bed. She put a network of goat hair at its head to mimic human hair, and then covered the idol with a garment to make it look like a sleeping person.
1 Samuel 19:14 When King Saul sent messengers to seize David, they were given the answer: “He is sick in bed.”
1 Samuel 19:15 King Saul sent the messengers back to see David, commanding: “Bring him here to me, even in his bed, so that I may put him to death myself.”
1 Samuel 19:16 But when the messengers arrived, behold, they found only the household idol lying on the bed, with the network of goat hair at its head.
1 Samuel 19:17 King Saul then confronted Michal, saying: “Why have you so shamelessly deceived me and allowed my enemy to escape?” Michal answered Saul: “Because he threatened me directly, saying: ‘Let me go, or else I will kill you.’”
1 Samuel 19:18 In the meantime, David, having fled for his life, was saved. He came to the prophet Samuel in Ramath, and told him everything that King Saul had done to him. Then David and Samuel went to Najoth in Ramath and stayed there together.
1 Samuel 19:19 And it was reported to King Saul, saying: “Behold, David is in Najoth in Ramath.”
1 Samuel 19:20 So King Saul sent messengers to seize David. But when they arrived and saw the company of prophets engaged in prophetic utterance, with Samuel standing over them as their leader, the Spirit of the Lord also came upon King Saul’s messengers, and they too began to prophesy.
1 Samuel 19:21 But when this was reported to King Saul, he sent yet another group of messengers. They also began to prophesy when they arrived. And a third time King Saul sent messengers, and they too began to prophesy. At this, King Saul became extremely angry, and he himself departed for Ramath.
1 Samuel 19:22 And he came as far as the great well that is in Socho. He then inquired, asking: “In what place are Samuel and David?” And one of the men there told him: “Behold, they are in Najoth, in Ramath.”
1 Samuel 19:23 So King Saul went there to Najoth in Ramath. And the Spirit of the Lord also came upon him. As he walked along the way, he continued prophesying until he reached Najoth in Ramath.
1 Samuel 19:24 And he too stripped himself of his royal garments, and prophesied before Samuel. He lay there naked, prostrate on the ground, for that entire day and all through the night. This is why the proverb came into being: “Is Saul also counted among the prophets?”
1 Samuel 20:1 But David fled from Naioth, which is in Ramah. He then came before Jonathan and asked: "What have I done? What is my sin, and what is my iniquity against your father, that he is seeking my very life?"
1 Samuel 20:2 Jonathan answered him: "Far be it from you to think that! You shall not die. For my father does nothing, whether great or small, without first revealing it to me. Why then would my father hide this matter from me? It is not as you think."
1 Samuel 20:3 But David swore again and said: "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes. He said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this, lest he be grieved.' Truly, as the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, there is only a step between me and death."
1 Samuel 20:4 Jonathan then said to David: "Whatever your soul desires, I will do for you."
1 Samuel 20:5 David said to Jonathan: "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon festival, and I cannot eat with the king. I must be absent."
1 Samuel 20:6 "Therefore, let me go, so that I may hide in the field until the evening of the third day."
1 Samuel 20:7 "If your father asks for me, you shall answer him: 'David earnestly requested me to let him go to Bethlehem, his own city, because there is a solemn sacrifice there for all his relatives.'"
1 Samuel 20:8 "If he says, 'It is well,' then your servant is safe. But if he becomes angry, know for certain that his evil intent is fixed."
1 Samuel 20:9 "Therefore, deal mercifully with your servant, for you have brought me, your servant, into a covenant of the Lord with you. If there is any iniquity in me, kill me yourself; do not bring me to your father."
1 Samuel 20:10 Jonathan said to him: "Far be it from you to think that! For if I should certainly know that evil has been determined by my father to come upon you, I myself will tell you."
1 Samuel 20:11 David said to Jonathan: "Who will inform me if your father answers you harshly?"
1 Samuel 20:12 Jonathan said to David: "Come, let us go out into the field." So both of them went out into the field.
1 Samuel 20:13 Then Jonathan said to David: "May the Lord, the God of Israel, be a witness! I will diligently question my father. If there is anything good concerning David, I will surely send word to you and reveal it to you without delay."
1 Samuel 20:14 "This I say: may you never perish." —meaning, may your life and lineage be preserved.
1 Samuel 20:15 "Or if my house perishes, when the Lord has brought evil upon the earth against all the enemies of David,"
1 Samuel 20:16 "may Jonathan himself be cast off from your sight forever. But you also shall show the Lord's mercy to your servant forever, and you shall not kill me."
1 Samuel 20:17 Jonathan therefore made David swear again, because he loved him; for he loved him as his own soul.
1 Samuel 20:18 Jonathan also said to him: "Tomorrow is the new moon festival, and you will be missed."
1 Samuel 20:19 "Indeed, your seat will be empty. On the third day, you must hurry and come to the place where you hid yourself on the day of the appointed meeting, and you will sit by the stone whose name is Ezel."
1 Samuel 20:20 "And I will shoot three arrows beside it, as if I were shooting at a target."
1 Samuel 20:21 "Behold, I will send a boy, saying to him, 'Go, fetch me the arrows.' If I say to the boy, 'Behold, the arrows are within reach of you, pick them up,' then you come to me. For there is peace for you, and no harm is intended, as the Lord lives."
1 Samuel 20:22 "But if I speak thus to the boy: 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you,' then go quickly, because the Lord has sent you away."
1 Samuel 20:23 "And concerning this word, which we have spoken, you and I, may the Lord be between me and you forever."
1 Samuel 20:24 So David hid himself in the field. When the new moon festival day came, the king sat down to eat bread.
1 Samuel 20:25 The king sat in his customary place, which was by the wall. Jonathan rose, and Abner sat at Saul's side, but David's place appeared empty.
1 Samuel 20:26 And Saul said nothing on that day, because he supposed that something had happened by chance, that perhaps David was not ritually clean nor purified.
1 Samuel 20:27 But when the second day after the new moon festival dawned, David was still absent from the king's table. Saul then said to Jonathan, his son: "Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, neither yesterday nor today?"
1 Samuel 20:28 Jonathan answered Saul: "David earnestly requested me to let him go to Bethlehem."
1 Samuel 20:29 "He said: 'Let me go, because there is a family sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, I will go quickly and see my brothers.' For this reason, he has not come to the king's table."
1 Samuel 20:30 Then Saul became angry with Jonathan and said to him: "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman, do I not know that you love the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame and disgrace of your mother?"
1 Samuel 20:31 "For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now, therefore, send and bring him to me, for he is a son deserving of death."
1 Samuel 20:32 Jonathan answered Saul, his father, and said: "Why should he die? What has he done?"
1 Samuel 20:33 Then Saul raised his spear against Jonathan to strike him. And Jonathan understood that his father was determined to kill David.
1 Samuel 20:34 So Jonathan rose from the table in furious anger and did not eat bread on the second day of the new moon festival meal. For he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.
1 Samuel 20:35 When morning dawned, Jonathan came into the field according to David's word, and a small boy was with him.
1 Samuel 20:36 He said to his boy: "Go, fetch me the arrows that I shoot." As the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond the boy.
1 Samuel 20:37 So the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot. And Jonathan cried out after the boy's back, saying: "Behold, the arrow is beyond you!"
1 Samuel 20:38 And Jonathan cried out after the boy's back, saying: "Hurry quickly, do not stand still!" So the boy of Jonathan gathered the arrows and brought them to his master.
1 Samuel 20:39 However, the boy knew absolutely nothing of the matter; only Jonathan and David understood the secret plan.
1 Samuel 20:40 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said to him: "Go, carry them into the city."
1 Samuel 21:1 David then arrived in Nob, where he met Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech was surprised to see David and he asked him: 'Why are you alone? Is no one else with you?'
1 Samuel 21:2 David responded to Ahimelech the priest, saying: 'The king has given me a secret order, and he said to me: “No one is to know about the mission I am on, or what I commanded you.” So I sent my young men to a certain place and told them to hide there.'
1 Samuel 21:3 Now, if you have any provisions on hand, please give me something. Even five loaves of bread would be enough, or whatever you can find.
1 Samuel 21:4 The priest answered David, saying: 'I don’t have any ordinary bread here. I only have the consecrated bread—the Bread of the Presence. You may have it only if your young men are ritually pure, especially if they have abstained from contact with women.'
1 Samuel 21:5 David answered the priest, saying: 'Indeed, as for women, we have kept ourselves from them since yesterday and the day before, ever since we departed. My young men are ritually clean. Furthermore, even if this particular journey made us unclean, it will be made holy today by our commitment to holiness.'
1 Samuel 21:6 So Achimelech gave him the Bread of the Presence, because there was no other bread there except for that Bread of the Presence, which had been removed from before the Lord so that fresh, hot bread could be put in its place.
1 Samuel 21:7 Now, one of Saul’s servants happened to be there that day, confined in the tabernacle of the Lord. His name was Doëg the Idumaean, and he was in charge of Saul’s many camels.
1 Samuel 21:8 David then said to Ahimelech: 'Do you have a spear or a sword here on hand? For I did not bring my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s mission required haste.'
1 Samuel 21:9 The priest replied: 'The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take it, take it, for there is no other sword here except this one.' David then exclaimed: 'There is none like it! Give it to me!'
1 Samuel 21:10 So David rose and fled that day from Saul. He went to King Achis of Gath.
1 Samuel 21:11 King Achis’s servants said to him: 'Isn’t this David, the king of his land? Isn’t he the one people sang about in their dances, saying: 'Saul has struck down a thousand, and David ten thousand!''
1 Samuel 21:12 David took these words to heart and became very afraid of King Achis of Gath.
1 Samuel 21:13 So he changed his behavior in front of them and pretended to be mad while in their hands. He scratched on the doors of the city gate, and his saliva ran down his beard.
1 Samuel 21:14 King Achis then said to his servants: 'Look, you can see this man is insane. Why have you brought him to me?'
1 Samuel 21:15 'Do we not have enough madmen of our own that you should bring this one to me? Is this fellow to enter my house?'
1 Samuel 21:16 David therefore departed from there and fled to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all his father’s household heard about it, they went down to him there.
1 Samuel 21:17 And everyone who was in distress, or overwhelmed by debt, or bitter in spirit, gathered to him. He became their leader, and about four hundred men were with him.
1 Samuel 21:18 David then went from there to Mizpah of Moab and said to the king of Moab: 'Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.'
1 Samuel 21:19 And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him for all the days that David was in the stronghold.
1 Samuel 21:20 Then Gad the prophet said to David: 'Do not stay in the stronghold. Depart and go into the land of Judah.' So David departed and went to the forest of Hereth.
1 Samuel 21:21 Saul heard that David and the men with him had been discovered. Saul himself was then staying in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the high place in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.
1 Samuel 21:22 Saul then said to all his servants who stood around him: 'Listen now, you sons of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of a thousand and commanders of a hundred?'
1 Samuel 21:23 'For all of you have conspired against me, and no one tells me why my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse. And there is no one among you who pities me or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait for me, as is clear today.'
1 Samuel 21:24 But Doëg the Idumaean, who was standing with Saul’s servants, answered and said: 'I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub the priest.'
1 Samuel 21:25 'He consulted the Lord for him, and gave him bread, and also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.'
1 Samuel 21:26 So the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and for all the house of his father, the priests who were in Nob. They all came to the king.
1 Samuel 21:27 Saul then said: 'Listen, son of Ahitub!' He answered: 'Here I am, my lord.'
1 Samuel 21:28 And Saul said to him: 'Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse? You gave him bread and a sword, and you consulted God for him, so that he would rise up against me as an ambush, even to this very day.'
1 Samuel 21:29 Ahimelech answered the king, saying: 'And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, who is also the king’s son-in-law? He carries out your commands and is honored in your house.'
1 Samuel 21:30 'Did I only begin to consult God for him today? Far be it from me! Let not the king suspect anything against his servant, or against all the house of my father. For your servant knew nothing at all of this, neither more nor less.'
1 Samuel 21:31 And the king said: 'You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all the house of your father!'
1 Samuel 21:32 The king then said to the guards standing around him: 'Go, and kill the priests of the Lord! Because their hand is with David, and knowing that he had fled, they did not inform me.' But the king’s servants were unwilling to lay their hands on the priests of the Lord.
1 Samuel 21:33 Then the king said to Doëg: 'You turn and kill the priests!' And Doëg the Idumaean turned and himself killed the priests. He slaughtered on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
1 Samuel 21:34 And Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the edge of the sword—men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep—all by the edge of the sword.
1 Samuel 21:35 However, one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, escaped and fled to David.
1 Samuel 21:36 And he reported to David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord.
1 Samuel 21:37 And David said to Abiathar: 'I knew on that day, when Doëg the Idumaean was there, that he would surely report it to Saul. I am responsible for the loss of all the lives in your father’s house.'
1 Samuel 21:38 'Stay with me, do not be afraid. For wherever my life goes, your life will go with me.'
1 Samuel 21:39 Then David was informed, saying: 'Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are plundering the threshing floors!'
1 Samuel 21:40 So David consulted the Lord, saying: 'Shall I go and strike down these Philistines?' And the Lord said to David: 'Go, strike down the Philistines, and save Keilah.'
1 Samuel 21:1 David therefore came to Nob to see Achimelech, the high priest. Achimelech was startled when David arrived, and he said to him, 'Why are you all by yourself? Why is there no one with you?'
1 Samuel 21:2 David said to Achimelech the high priest, 'The king has given me a secret mission and told me: 'No one is to know about the mission I have sent you on, nor the instructions I have given you.' I have also arranged for my young men to meet me at a specified location.'
1 Samuel 21:3 Now then, if you have any food available, give me at least five loaves of bread, or whatever else you can find.
1 Samuel 21:4 The priest answered David, saying, 'I don't have any ordinary bread available, but only the holy showbread, which is consecrated to God. Are the young men pure, especially from having been with women?'
1 Samuel 21:5 David answered the high priest, saying, 'Indeed, as for women, we have kept ourselves from them since we began our journey yesterday and the day before. The young men's bodies have been kept ritually pure. Normally, our journey would be defiled, but even our mission will be considered holy today because of the sacred nature of our work, as long as our bodies remain pure.'
1 Samuel 21:6 So the high priest gave David the holy bread because there was no other bread available there. It was only the showbread, which had been taken from before the Lord's presence in the tabernacle, so that fresh, hot bread could be put in its place.
1 Samuel 21:7 Now, on that very day, one of Saul's servants was present there inside the tabernacle of the Lord. His name was Doëg the Edomite, and he was the chief over Saul's many herdsmen.
1 Samuel 21:8 Then David said to Achimelech, 'Do you have a spear or a sword here that I can take? I didn't bring my own sword or my weapons with me, because the king's mission was too urgent for any delays.'
1 Samuel 21:9 The high priest replied, 'Look, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the priestly ephod. If you want to take it, then take it, for there is no other sword here. Only that one.' David then exclaimed, 'There is no other sword like it! Give it to me!'
1 Samuel 21:10 So David then got up and fled that very day from King Saul's presence. He went to Achish, who was the king of Gath.
1 Samuel 21:11 But the servants of King Achish said to him, 'Is this not David, who is like a king in his own land? Was it not to this very man that they sang in the dances, saying: 'Saul has struck down his thousands, but David his ten thousands?'
1 Samuel 21:12 David took these words seriously and stored them in his heart, and he became very afraid of King Achish of Gath.
1 Samuel 21:13 So David changed his behavior in front of them and feigned madness while they held him. He began to scribble on the city gate doors, and his saliva ran down his beard.
1 Samuel 21:14 Achish then said to his servants, 'Look, you can see the man is mad! Why have you brought him to me?'
1 Samuel 21:15 'Do I not have enough madmen of my own that you would bring this man here to act like a lunatic in front of me? Should such a man be allowed into my royal residence?'
1 Samuel 21:16 So David fled from Gath and came to the cave of Adullam.
1 Samuel 22:1 So David fled from Gath and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and all of his father's household heard of his hiding place, they went down to him there.
1 Samuel 22:2 Everyone who was in a difficult situation, burdened by debt, or bitter in spirit gathered to him. And David became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
1 Samuel 22:3 From there, David went to Mizpah in Moab. He said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and my mother stay here with you, until I know what God will do for me" —seeking protection for his parents in his ancestral homeland.
1 Samuel 22:4 So David left them with the king of Moab, and his parents remained there with the king all the time David was in his places of refuge.
1 Samuel 22:5 But the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not remain in this place of refuge. Leave immediately and go into the land of Judah." So David left and went into the forest of Hareth.
1 Samuel 22:6 Saul heard that David and the men with him had been discovered. At that time, Saul was staying in Gibeah, sitting under a prominent tree in the grove near Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.
1 Samuel 22:7 He said to his servants who stood around him, "Listen now, you sons of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse—David—give all of you fields and vineyards, and make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?"
1 Samuel 22:8 "You have all conspired against me, and no one informs me that my own son, Jonathan, has made a covenant with the son of Jesse! Is there no one among you who feels for my cause, or who will tell me that my son has stirred up my own servant David against me, inciting him to lie in ambush for me even to this very day?"
1 Samuel 22:9 But Doeg the Edomite, one of Saul's servants who was standing there, answered, "I saw the son of Jesse—David—in Nob with Ahimelech the priest, son of Ahitub."
1 Samuel 22:10 "Ahimelech consulted the Lord on David's behalf, gave him provisions, and also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
1 Samuel 22:11 So the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, son of Ahitub, and for all his father's household—all the priests who were in Nob. They all came to the king.
1 Samuel 22:12 And Saul said, "Listen, son of Ahitub." Ahimelech responded, "Here I am, my lord."
1 Samuel 22:13 Saul then said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, David? You gave him bread and a sword, and you consulted God on his behalf, so that he might rise up against me as an ambusher even to this very day!"
1 Samuel 22:14 Ahimelech responded to the king, saying, "Who among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is also the king's son-in-law, obedient to your command, and held in honor in your own household. He is above reproach."
1 Samuel 22:15 "Have I only just today begun to consult the Lord on his behalf? Absolutely not! Let not the king suspect his servant, nor any of my father's household, of any wrongdoing. For I, your servant, knew nothing at all about this matter, neither great nor small."
1 Samuel 22:16 Then the king declared, "You will surely die, Ahimelech—you and all of your father's household."
1 Samuel 22:17 Then the king said to the guards who were standing around him, "Turn and kill the priests of the Lord! Their hands are with David, for they knew he had fled but did not inform me." But the king's servants refused to raise their hands to strike down the priests of the Lord.
1 Samuel 22:18 Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn and attack the priests!" So Doeg the Edomite turned, attacked the priests, and on that day killed eighty-five men who wore the sacred linen ephod.
1 Samuel 22:19 Nob, the city of the priests, was also utterly destroyed by the sword. Doeg put to death men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys, and sheep—everything in the city.
1 Samuel 22:20 But one son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled to David.
1 Samuel 22:21 Abiathar informed David that Saul had murdered the priests of the Lord.
1 Samuel 22:22 David said to Abiathar, "I knew it that day! When Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would undoubtedly report everything to Saul. I am responsible for the deaths of everyone in your father's household."
1 Samuel 22:23 "Stay with me; do not be afraid. For whoever seeks my life also seeks your life, and you will be safe here with me."
1 Samuel 22:1 David then left that place, and took refuge in the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's entire household heard about this, they went down to join him there.
1 Samuel 22:2 All those who were in distress gathered around him, all who were burdened by any kind of debt or trouble, and all who felt their lives were bitter; and David became their leader. There were about four hundred men with him.
1 Samuel 22:3 From there, David went to Mizpah in Moab, and he said to the king of Moab: "Please allow my father and my mother to stay with you, until I know what God will do for me."
1 Samuel 22:4 So David left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him for all the days that David was in his stronghold.
1 Samuel 22:5 Then Gad the prophet said to David: "Do not remain in this stronghold; depart and go into the land of Judah." So David left and came into the forest of Hereth.
1 Samuel 22:6 Now Saul heard that David had been discovered, along with the men who were with him. At that time, Saul was staying in Gibeah, sitting under a tamarisk tree on a high place in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him.
1 Samuel 22:7 Saul said to his servants who stood around him: "Listen, I beg you, sons of Jemini! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards, and make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
1 Samuel 22:8 Why have all of you conspired against me? No one among you reports to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse. No one among you grieves for me or informs me that my son has incited my servant to ambush me, as he has done even to this very day."
1 Samuel 22:9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing there and was the chief among Saul's servants, answered and said: "I saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, the high priest.
1 Samuel 22:10 Ahimelech consulted the Lord for him, and also gave him provisions and even the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
1 Samuel 22:11 So the king sent for Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and for his father's entire household, the priests who were in Nob. They all came to the king.
1 Samuel 22:12 Saul said: "Listen, son of Ahitub!" And he answered: "I am ready, my lord."
1 Samuel 22:13 Saul said to him: "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse? You gave him bread and a sword, and you consulted God for him, so that he might rise up against me as an enemy, as an ambusher, even to this day?"
1 Samuel 22:14 Ahimelech answered the king, saying: "And who among all your servants is as faithful as David? He is the king's son-in-law, always ready to obey your command, and honored in your own household!
1 Samuel 22:15 Is this the first time I began consulting God for him? Absolutely not! Let the king not suspect anything against his servant, nor against my father's entire household; for your servant knew nothing about this matter, neither little nor much."
1 Samuel 22:16 And the king said: "You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all of your father's household!"
1 Samuel 22:17 Then the king said to his bodyguards, who stood around him: "Turn around and kill the priests of the Lord, because their loyalty is with David; they knew he had fled, yet they did not inform me." But the king's servants refused to raise their hands against the Lord's priests.
1 Samuel 22:18 So the king said to Doeg: "You turn, and fall upon the priests!" And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, killing on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod, a sacred garment worn by priests.
1 Samuel 22:19 He also struck Nob, the city of the priests, with the edge of the sword, killing men and women, children and nursing infants, as well as oxen, donkeys, and sheep, all by the edge of the sword.
1 Samuel 22:20 However, one son of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled to David.
1 Samuel 22:21 He reported to David that Saul had killed the Lord's priests.
1 Samuel 22:22 David said to Abiathar: "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely report it to Saul. I am responsible for the loss of all the lives of your father's household.
1 Samuel 22:23 Stay with me; do not be afraid. For whoever seeks my life will also seek your life, and with me, you will be safe."
1 Samuel 23:1 Then people brought news to David, saying: "Listen! The Philistines are attacking Keilah, and they are looting the threshing floors."
1 Samuel 23:2 So David consulted the Lord, saying: "Should I go and strike down these Philistines?" And the Lord said to David: "Go, and you will strike down the Philistines, and you will save Keilah."
1 Samuel 23:3 But the men who were with David said to him: "Look, we are afraid even here in Judah. How much more will we be afraid if we go to Keilah and face the armies of the Philistines?"
1 Samuel 23:4 So David again consulted the Lord. And the Lord answered him and said: "Rise up, and go to Keilah, because I will deliver the Philistines into your hand."
1 Samuel 23:5 Therefore David and his men went to Keilah, and he fought against the Philistines, and he drove off their livestock, and he struck them with a great slaughter; and so David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
1 Samuel 23:6 Now it happened that when Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, fled to David in Keilah, he was carrying the ephod in his hand.
1 Samuel 23:7 And it was reported to Saul that David had come to Keilah, and Saul said: "God has delivered him into my hands, for he is shut in, having entered a city that has gates and bars."
1 Samuel 23:8 And Saul commanded all the people to go down to war in Keilah and to besiege David and his men.
1 Samuel 23:9 However, David, when he knew that Saul was secretly preparing evil against him, said to Abiathar the priest: "Bring the ephod here."
1 Samuel 23:10 And David said: "O Lord God of Israel, Your servant has heard the report that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city on account of me."
1 Samuel 23:11 "Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hands? And will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O Lord God of Israel, tell Your servant."
1 Samuel 23:12 And the Lord said: "They will deliver you."
1 Samuel 23:13 So David and his men, about six hundred of them, rose up and went out from Keilah, and they wandered about, uncertain where to go. And it was reported to Saul that David had fled from Keilah, so he halted his journey.
1 Samuel 23:14 But David remained in the wilderness, in very fortified places; he also remained on the desert mountain of Ziph. So Saul searched for him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hands.
1 Samuel 23:15 And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. Now David was in the wilderness of Ziph, in the forest.
1 Samuel 23:16 Then Jonathan, Saul's son, rose up and went to David in the forest, and he strengthened David's hand in God, and said to him:
1 Samuel 23:17 "Do not be afraid, for the hand of Saul my father will not seize you. You will reign over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this."
1 Samuel 23:18 So David and Jonathan made a covenant before the Lord. And David remained in the forest, but Jonathan returned to his home.
1 Samuel 23:19 Now the Ziphites went up from David to Saul in Gibeah, saying: "Is not David hiding among us in the very strongholds in the forest, on the hill of Hachilah, which is to the right of the desert?"
1 Samuel 23:20 "Now then, if your soul desires to come down, come down. It is our duty to deliver him into the king's hands."
1 Samuel 23:21 And Saul said: "May you be blessed by the Lord, because you have felt sorrow for my plight."
1 Samuel 23:22 "Go therefore, and prepare yourselves, and find out and carefully observe the place where he stays, or who has seen him; or if he is truly there, let someone make me know his exact location."
1 Samuel 23:23 "Observe closely and know all the hiding places in which he hides, and return to me at a certain place, so that I may go with you. For if he is in the land, I will search for him among all the thousands of Judah."
1 Samuel 23:24 So they rose up and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. But David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain to the right of Jeshimon.
1 Samuel 23:25 So Saul and his companions went down to search. And when this was reported to David, he went down to the rock and remained in the wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard this, he pursued David into the wilderness of Maon.
1 Samuel 23:26 And Saul went on one side of this mountain, and David with his men on the other side of that mountain. Now David was hurrying to flee from Saul, and Saul with his army was encircling David and his men to capture them.
1 Samuel 23:27 Then a messenger came to Saul, saying: "Hurry and come, for the Philistines have raided the land!"
1 Samuel 23:28 So Saul returned and stopped pursuing David. For this reason, they called that place "The Dividing Rock."
1 Samuel 23:29 Therefore David went up from there and remained in the strongholds of En-Gedi.
1 Samuel 24:1 Now it happened that when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, a message was brought to him, saying: 'Indeed, David is in the wilderness of Engedi!'
1 Samuel 24:2 So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all of Israel and went to seek out David and his men, going as far as the most rugged rocks, where the wild goats dwell.
1 Samuel 24:3 And he came to the sheepfolds that were along the way, and there was a cave there. Saul entered it to relieve himself. Now, David and his men were hiding in the inner parts of the cave, deep inside.
1 Samuel 24:4 And David's men said to him: 'Behold, this is the very day of which the Lord spoke to you, saying: 'I will deliver your enemy into your hand, so that you may do to him whatever seems right in your eyes!'' Therefore, David rose up and quietly cut off the hem of Saul's cloak.
1 Samuel 24:5 After this, David's conscience struck him, because he had cut off the hem of Saul's cloak, recognizing it as a disrespectful act against God's anointed.
1 Samuel 24:6 And he said to his men: 'May the Lord be merciful to me, that I should not do this thing to my lord, the Lord's anointed, by laying my hand on him. For he is the Christ—the anointed one—of the Lord!'
1 Samuel 24:7 And David restrained his men with these words, and he did not permit them to rise up against Saul. Meanwhile, Saul rose from the cave and continued on his way.
1 Samuel 24:8 However, David also rose after him and, coming out of the cave, he cried out behind Saul, saying: 'My lord, O King!'
1 Samuel 24:9 And Saul looked behind him. Then David bowed himself with his face to the ground and worshipped, showing profound respect.
1 Samuel 24:10 And David said to Saul: 'Why do you listen to the words of men who speak and say: 'Behold, David seeks your harm?' These are false accusations.
1 Samuel 24:11 Behold, today your own eyes have seen that the Lord delivered you into my hand in the cave. I considered killing you, but my eye spared you; I had compassion on you.
1 Samuel 24:12 And I said: 'I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the Christ—the anointed one—of the Lord!'
1 Samuel 24:13 Look rather, my father, and acknowledge this hem of your cloak in my hand. For when I cut off your hem, I refused to lay my hand on you.
1 Samuel 24:14 Understand this, and see that there is no evil in my hand, nor injustice, nor any sin on my part, and I have committed no offense against you. Yet you lie in wait for my very life, to take it away.
1 Samuel 24:15 May the Lord judge between me and you, and may the Lord avenge me against you, but my hand shall not be against you. I will not take justice into my own hands.
1 Samuel 24:16 Just as the old proverb says: 'Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.' But my hand shall not be against you.
1 Samuel 24:17 Whom are you pursuing, O King of Israel? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, or a single flea? These are insults, showing how little of a threat I am.
1 Samuel 24:18 May the Lord be judge, and may He judge between me and you. May He see and decide my cause, and deliver me from your hand.
1 Samuel 24:19 Now when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said: 'Is this your voice, my son David?'
1 Samuel 24:20 And Saul raised his voice and wept aloud.
1 Samuel 24:21 And he said to David: 'You are more righteous than I, for you have rendered good to me, while I have rendered evil to you.'
1 Samuel 24:22 For you have shown today the good things you have done for me: how the Lord delivered me into your hand, and yet you did not kill me.
1 Samuel 24:23 For no one finds his enemy and lets him go on a good way; instead, may the Lord repay you for the good you have done to me today.
1 Samuel 25:1 Samuel died, and all Israel gathered and mourned for him. They buried him at his home in Ramatha. David then got up and went down into the desert of Paran.
1 Samuel 25:2 There was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel. This man was extremely rich; he owned three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was in Carmel for the shearing of his flock.
1 Samuel 25:3 The man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigail. She was a very prudent and good woman, but her husband was a harsh and wicked man. He was of the lineage of Caleb.
1 Samuel 25:4 David heard in the desert that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1 Samuel 25:5 So David sent ten young men, and said to them: 'Go up to Carmel, and when you come to Nabal, ask him in my name how he fares and wish him peace.'
1 Samuel 25:6 And say this: 'Live well, my brother, and may all things prosper for you, for your whole household, and for all that is yours.'
1 Samuel 25:7 'I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us in the desert; we never harmed them, nor was anything lost from them all the days they were with us in Carmel.'
1 Samuel 25:8 'Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore, may my young men find favor in your eyes. Since we have come on a good day, please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.'
1 Samuel 25:9 When David's young men came, they spoke all these words to Nabal in David's name, and then they waited in silence.
1 Samuel 25:10 Nabal answered David's servants, saying: 'Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? Today there are many servants who are running away from their masters!'
1 Samuel 25:11 'Therefore, shall I take my bread, my water, and the meat which I have butchered for my shearers, and give it to men of whom I do not even know where they come from?'
1 Samuel 25:12 So David's young men turned back on their way, and when they came, they reported all of Nabal's words to him.
1 Samuel 25:13 And David said to his men: 'Let each one gird on his sword.' And each one girded on his sword. David also girded on his sword. About four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.
1 Samuel 25:14 However, one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying: 'Behold, David sent messengers from the desert to greet our master; but he drove them away with insults.'
1 Samuel 25:15 'And these men were very good to us. They did not afflict us, nor was anything taken from us all the time we were with them in the desert.'
1 Samuel 25:16 'They were like a protective wall to us both night and day, all the days we were with them, while our shepherds were pasturing the sheep.'
1 Samuel 25:17 'Therefore, know now and consider what you should do. For evil is determined against our master and against your whole household. Our master Nabal is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him, so you must act.'
1 Samuel 25:18 So Abigail quickly prepared and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five roasted sheep, five measures of parched corn, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them upon donkeys.
1 Samuel 25:19 And she said to her young men: 'Go on ahead of me; behold, I will follow you.' But she did not tell her husband Nabal about this.
1 Samuel 25:20 As Abigail rode on her donkey and was coming down under the cover of the mountain, David and his men appeared, coming down towards her, and she met them.
1 Samuel 25:21 Now David had been saying to his men: 'Truly, it was in vain that I guarded all that belonged to this man in the desert, and that nothing was lost of all that pertains to him. For he has returned evil to me for good.'
1 Samuel 25:22 'May God do this to David's enemies, and more also, if by morning I leave alive even one male belonging to Nabal, even one who pisses against a wall' —meaning not a single male would survive to urinate on the walls of their home, ensuring total destruction.
1 Samuel 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from her donkey, and she fell before David on her face and prostrated herself on the ground in supplication.
1 Samuel 25:24 And she fell at his feet and said: 'Let this iniquity be upon me alone, my lord. I beg you, let your handmaid speak in your hearing, and please listen to the words of your handmaid.'
1 Samuel 25:25 'Please, my lord, do not take to heart this worthless man Nabal. For as his name is, so he is: 'Nabal' means 'fool,' and foolishness is indeed with him. As for me, your handmaid, I did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.'
1 Samuel 25:26 'Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, the Lord has restrained you from shedding blood and has saved your hand from taking vengeance for yourself. And now, let your enemies and those who seek evil for my lord become like Nabal.'
1 Samuel 25:27 'And now, accept this gift, which your handmaid has brought to you, my lord, and give it to the young men who follow you.'
1 Samuel 25:28 'Please forgive the offense of your handmaid. For the Lord will surely make a faithful and enduring house for my lord, because you fight the battles of the Lord, and no evil has been found in you all the days of your life.'
1 Samuel 25:29 'If indeed a man should rise up to pursue you and seek your life, the life of my lord will be bound up in the bundle of the living with the Lord your God, held securely in His protection. But the lives of your enemies, He will sling out as from the hollow of a sling in a whirlwind, scattering them to destruction.'
1 Samuel 25:30 'When therefore the Lord has done for my lord all the good things He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you leader over Israel —meaning when you become king—'
1 Samuel 25:31 'This will not be a cause for stumbling or a pang of regret in your heart, my lord, that you would have shed blood without cause, or avenged yourself. And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord, you will remember your handmaid.'
1 Samuel 25:32 And David said to Abigail: 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me, and blessed be your counsel.'
1 Samuel 25:33 'And blessed be your wisdom, and blessed are you, who have prevented me this day from going to shed blood and from avenging myself with my own hand.'
1 Samuel 25:34 'Otherwise, as the Lord God of Israel lives, Who has restrained me from doing evil to you: had you not come quickly to meet me, surely by morning, Nabal would not have been left with even one male who pisses against a wall, ensuring total annihilation.'
1 Samuel 25:35 So David received from her hand what she had brought to him, and he said to her: 'Go in peace to your house. Behold, I have heard your voice and respected your plea.'
1 Samuel 25:36 So Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, there was a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry, because he was excessively drunk. So she did not tell him anything at all until the morning.
1 Samuel 25:37 But in the morning, when Nabal had sobered up from the wine, his wife told him these things. And his heart died within him from shock, and he became like a stone.
1 Samuel 25:38 And it happened, after about ten days, that the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.
1 Samuel 25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said: 'Blessed be the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept His servant from evil, and has returned Nabal's wickedness upon his own head.' So David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her to himself as a wife.
1 Samuel 25:40 So David's servants came to Abigail at Carmel, and they spoke to her, saying: 'David has sent us to you, to take you to himself as a wife.'
1 Samuel 25:1 Samuel died, and all of Israel gathered together and mourned for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. David then rose up and went down into the wilderness of Paran.
1 Samuel 25:2 There was a man in the highlands of Maon whose property was in Carmel, and that man was exceedingly wealthy. He had three thousand sheep and one thousand goats, and it so happened that he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
1 Samuel 25:3 The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was a very prudent and good woman. Her husband, however, was hard-hearted and evil, and he was a descendant of Caleb.
1 Samuel 25:4 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1 Samuel 25:5 So David sent ten young men and told them: “Go up to Carmel and approach Nabal. Greet him on my behalf with good wishes and peace.”
1 Samuel 25:6 And this is what you are to say: 'May you live long and prosper, and may your household and all that belongs to you also prosper.'
1 Samuel 25:7 'I have just heard that your shepherds are shearing. Do you have my shepherds in Carmel — (meaning, those who have been protecting your flock)?'
1 Samuel 25:8 'They — (my men who have been protecting your flock) — will not be put to shame. Your young men ask you to give whatever you find to your servants and to your son David.'
1 Samuel 25:9 'We have come on a good day. Whatever is at hand, please give it to your servants and to your son David.'
1 Samuel 25:10 So when the young men arrived, they conveyed all these words to Nabal in David’s name, and then they fell silent, waiting for his response.
1 Samuel 25:11 Nabal answered David’s servants, saying: “Who is this David? And who is the son of Jesse? Today, many servants are running away from their masters. — (I won't help such men).”
1 Samuel 25:12 “Am I then to take my bread, my water, and the meat that I have slaughtered for those who are shearing my flock, and give it to men of whom I do not know where they come from? Absolutely not.”
1 Samuel 25:13 So David’s young men turned back and reported all of Nabal’s words to him.
1 Samuel 25:14 Then David said to his young men: “Let each man strap on his sword!” And each man strapped on his sword. David himself also strapped on his sword. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred remained behind to guard the supplies.
1 Samuel 25:15 But one of Nabal’s young men had told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying: “Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master — (respectfully and with good intent) — but he violently lashed out at them.”
1 Samuel 25:16 “Yet, they were very good men. They caused us no trouble at all, nor did they take anything from our possessions during all the days they were with us when we were in the field.”
1 Samuel 25:17 “They were a wall of protection for us, day and night, throughout all the days we were with them while we were shepherds of the sheep.”
1 Samuel 25:18 “Therefore, now consider and see what you must do, because evil is determined against our master and against all his household. For he himself is such a wicked and worthless man that no one can speak to him — (he will not listen to reason).”
1 Samuel 25:19 So Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two wineskins of wine, five cooked sheep — (rams) — five measures of roasted grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and she loaded them onto donkeys.
1 Samuel 25:20 She said to her young men: “Go ahead of me; behold, I will follow behind you.” But she did not tell her husband, Nabal, about any of this.
1 Samuel 25:21 As she was riding on the donkey and descending by a hidden path of the mountain, David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them.
1 Samuel 25:22 Now David had just said: “Surely, it was for nothing that I guarded all this man’s possessions in the wilderness, and nothing was lost of all that belonged to him. Yet he has repaid me evil for good.”
1 Samuel 25:23 “May God do so to David’s enemies, and more also, if by morning I leave a single male alive from all that belongs to him.”
1 Samuel 25:24 When Abigail saw David, she quickly dismounted from her donkey and fell down at David’s feet, bowing low to the ground in reverence and supplication.
1 Samuel 25:25 She fell at his feet and said: “Upon me alone, my lord, let this iniquity fall. I beg you, let your servant speak in your hearing, and please listen to the words of your handmaid.”
1 Samuel 25:26 “Please, my lord, do not take to heart this worthless man, Nabal. For according to his name, he is a fool — (Nabal means 'fool') — and folly is with him. But I, your servant, did not see the young men whom you sent.”
1 Samuel 25:27 “Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord lives and as your soul lives, it is the Lord who has restrained you from coming to bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hand. Now let your enemies and those who seek evil for my lord be like Nabal — (worthless and overcome by divine judgment).”
1 Samuel 25:28 “May this blessing, which your servant has brought to you, my lord, be given to your servants who follow you.”
1 Samuel 25:29 “Please forgive the iniquity of your servant. For the Lord will surely make a lasting and faithful house for my lord, because you fight the battles of the Lord, and good things have been found in you all the days of your life.”
1 Samuel 25:30 “If a man rises up to pursue you and seek your life, the life of my lord will be guarded as in a bundle of the living with the Lord your God. But the lives of your enemies will be hurled away like a stone from a sling.”
1 Samuel 25:31 “When the Lord has done for my lord all the good things He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you leader over Israel, then this will not be a cause for stumbling or a troubled conscience for my lord — (the thought) — that you shed blood needlessly or avenged yourself. And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”
1 Samuel 25:32 David said to Abigail: “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me, and blessed be your counsel!”
1 Samuel 25:33 “And blessed be your wisdom, and blessed be you, who have restrained me today from going to shed blood and from avenging myself with my own hand.”
1 Samuel 25:34 “Otherwise, as surely as the Lord God of Israel lives, who has kept me from doing evil to you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, there would not have been left to Nabal by morning light a single male person — (meaning, every male in his household would have been destroyed).”
1 Samuel 25:35 Then David received from her hand what she had brought to him, and he said to her: “Go up in peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice and I have shown you favor.”
1 Samuel 25:36 Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. Nabal’s heart was merry, for he was exceedingly drunk. So she did not tell him anything at all until the morning.
1 Samuel 25:37 But in the morning, when Nabal had sobered up from his wine, his wife told him these things. And his heart died within him, and he became like a stone — (paralyzed by fear or a stroke).
1 Samuel 25:38 And about ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.
1 Samuel 25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said: “Blessed be the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept His servant from evil. He has returned Nabal’s wickedness upon his own head.” So David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her as his wife.
1 Samuel 25:40 David’s servants came to Abigail at Carmel and spoke to her, saying: “David has sent us to you, to take you as his wife.”
1 Samuel 26:1 But the Ziphites came from the wilderness to Saul, saying: 'Look! David is hiding on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite the wilderness.'
1 Samuel 26:2 So Saul got up and went down into the wilderness of Ziph, and with him were three thousand men, chosen from Israel, to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph.
1 Samuel 26:3 Saul made his camp on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite the wilderness, by the road. But David was living in the wilderness at that time, and seeing that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,
1 Samuel 26:4 David sent out scouts, and learned with certainty that Saul had indeed come.
1 Samuel 26:5 So David got up and went to the place where Saul was. He saw the exact place where Saul was sleeping, and Abner, the son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul's army, and Saul sleeping inside his tent, while the rest of the people were encamped all around him.
1 Samuel 26:6 David then said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, saying: 'Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?' And Abishai said: 'I will go down with you.'
1 Samuel 26:7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and they found Saul lying down and sleeping in his tent, and his spear was stuck in the ground at his head. But Abner and the people were sleeping all around him.
1 Samuel 26:8 Then Abishai said to David: 'God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Therefore, now I will pierce him with his own spear into the ground, just once, and a second time will not even be needed!'
1 Samuel 26:9 And David said to Abishai: 'Do not kill him; for who can stretch out his hand against the Anointed of the Lord and be innocent?'
1 Samuel 26:10 And David said: 'As the Lord lives! Unless the Lord strikes him down himself, or his day comes for him to die naturally, or he goes down into battle and perishes there;'
1 Samuel 26:11 'Far be it from me to stretch out my hand against the Anointed of the Lord! Now then, take the spear that is at his head, and the jug of water, and let us go.'
1 Samuel 26:12 So David took the spear and the jug of water that was at Saul's head, and they left. And there was no one who saw, or understood what was happening, or woke up; instead, all of them were sleeping, because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.
1 Samuel 26:13 When David had crossed to the other side of the valley, and had come to the top of a distant mountain, so that there was a great distance between them,
1 Samuel 26:14 David called out to the people and to Abner, son of Ner, saying: 'Won't you answer, Abner?' And Abner answered and said: 'Who are you, who calls out and disturbs the king?'
1 Samuel 26:15 And David said to Abner: 'Are you not a man of valor? And who is like you in all of Israel? Why then did you not guard your lord the king? For one of the people came in to kill your lord the king!'
1 Samuel 26:16 'This thing that you have done is not good! As the Lord lives, you are men worthy of death, because you did not guard your lord, the Anointed of the Lord! Now then, look where the king's spear is, and where the jug of water was, which was at his head!'
1 Samuel 26:17 And Saul recognized David's voice and said: 'Is this your voice, my son David?' And David said: 'It is my voice, my lord, O King!'
1 Samuel 26:18 And David said: 'Why does my lord pursue his servant? What have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?'
1 Samuel 26:19 'Now therefore, please hear, my lord the King, the words of your servant: If the Lord is inciting you against me, then let Him accept an offering. But if it is men who are doing this, then let them be cursed in the sight of the Lord! For they have driven me out today from living in the inheritance of the Lord, by saying: "Go, serve other gods!"'
1 Samuel 26:20 'And now, let my blood not be poured out on the ground away from the presence of the Lord; for you have come out to search for a single flea, just as one pursues a partridge in the mountains.'
1 Samuel 26:21 And Saul said: 'I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will never again seek to harm you, because my life was precious in your eyes today. I have acted foolishly, and have greatly erred.'
1 Samuel 26:22 And David answered and said: 'Here is the king's spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it.'
1 Samuel 26:23 'And the Lord will repay to each person according to his righteousness and his faithfulness, because I was unwilling to stretch out my hand against the Anointed of the Lord.'
1 Samuel 26:24 'And just as your life was valued greatly today in my eyes, so may my life be valued greatly in the eyes of the Lord, and may He deliver me from all trouble.'
1 Samuel 26:25 And Saul said to David: 'Blessed are you, my son David! For indeed, you will certainly do great things, and you will surely prevail!' So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his own place.
1 Samuel 26:1 Then the Ziphites came to Saul in Gibeah, saying: "Is David not hiding himself on the hill of Hachila, which is opposite the desert wilderness?"
1 Samuel 26:2 So Saul arose and went down into the desert of Ziph, and with him were three thousand chosen men from Israel, to search for David in the desert of Ziph.
1 Samuel 26:3 And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachila, which is opposite the desert wilderness, by the road. But David was living in the desert. Therefore, David saw that Saul had come after him into the desert.
1 Samuel 26:4 So David sent out scouts, and he learned for certain that Saul had indeed come.
1 Samuel 26:5 Then David arose and came to the place where Saul was. When David saw the place where Saul was sleeping, and Abner the son of Ner, who was the commander of his army, Saul was sleeping in the middle of the camp, and Abner and the others were all around him.
1 Samuel 26:6 And David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying: "Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" And Abishai said: "I will go down with you."
1 Samuel 26:7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and they found Saul lying down and sleeping in the camp, with his spear fixed in the ground at his head. But Abner and the people were sleeping all around him.
1 Samuel 26:8 And Abishai said to David: "God has delivered your enemy into your hand today. Now therefore, I will pin him to the ground with the spear once, and I will not need a second blow."
1 Samuel 26:9 But David said to Abishai: "Do not kill him. For who can stretch out his hand against the anointed of the Lord and remain innocent?"
1 Samuel 26:10 And David said: "As the Lord lives, either the Lord will strike him down, or his day will come for him to die, or he will perish by going down into battle."
1 Samuel 26:11 May the Lord be merciful to me, that I may not stretch out my hand against the anointed of the Lord. Now therefore, take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water, and let us go.
1 Samuel 26:12 So David took the spear and the jug of water that was at Saul’s head, and they departed. And no one saw or understood or was awake, for they were all sleeping, because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.
1 Samuel 26:13 When David had crossed over to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain far away, with a great distance between them:
1 Samuel 26:14 David cried out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying: "Do you not answer, Abner?" And Abner answered and said: "Who are you who cries out and disturbs the king?"
1 Samuel 26:15 And David said to Abner: "Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to kill your lord the king."
1 Samuel 26:16 This thing that you have done is not good. As the Lord lives, you are men deserving of death, because you have not guarded your lord, the anointed of the Lord. Now therefore, look where the king’s spear is, and where his jug of water was, which was at his head.
1 Samuel 26:17 Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said: "Is this your voice, my son David?" And David said: "It is my voice, my lord the king."
1 Samuel 26:18 And he added, saying: "For what reason does my lord pursue his servant? What have I committed? Or what evil is in my hand?"
1 Samuel 26:19 Now therefore, please hear, my lord the king, the words of your servant: "If the Lord stirs you up against me, let an offering be pleasing to Him. But if men have done this, may they be cursed in the sight of the Lord, for they have driven me out today from dwelling in the inheritance of the Lord, saying: 'Go, serve foreign gods.'"
1 Samuel 26:20 And now, let not my blood be shed on the ground before the Lord. For you have come out to seek my life, as one pursues a leopard in the mountains.
1 Samuel 26:21 And Saul said: "I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will never again seek your life, because my life was precious in your eyes today. Behold, I have acted foolishly, and I have made many great errors."
1 Samuel 26:22 And David answered and said: "Behold the king’s spear! Let one of the young men come over and take it."
1 Samuel 26:23 And the Lord will repay each man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, because I was unwilling to put forth my hand against the anointed of the Lord.
1 Samuel 26:24 And just as your life was valued greatly in my eyes today, so may my life be valued greatly in the eyes of the Lord, and may He deliver me from all trouble.
1 Samuel 26:25 Then Saul said to David: "Blessed are you, my son David. You will surely accomplish great things, and you will certainly prevail." So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his own place.
1 Samuel 27:1 But David said to himself: 'Eventually, I will be killed by Saul. Wouldn't it be better for me to escape and find safety in the land of the Philistines? Then Saul will give up hope and stop pursuing me throughout all the territory of Israel. This way I will escape from his power.'
1 Samuel 27:2 So David got up and went, along with his six hundred men, to Achish, the son of Maoch, who was the king of Gath.
1 Samuel 27:3 David lived with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each with his own household. David brought his two wives, Achinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, who had been Nabal's wife from Carmel.
1 Samuel 27:4 When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer tried to find him.
1 Samuel 27:5 Then David said to Achish: 'If I have found favor in your sight, please give me a place in one of the towns in this region where I can live. Why should your servant remain with you here in the royal capital?'
1 Samuel 27:6 So on that very day, Achish gave him Ziklag. This is why Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah even to this present day.
1 Samuel 27:7 The total time David lived in the territory of the Philistines was one year and four months.
1 Samuel 27:8 David and his men would go up and raid the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. These were the peoples who had lived in that land from ancient times, all the way from Shur to the land of Egypt.
1 Samuel 27:9 David would attack the entire land, leaving no man or woman alive. He would take the sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels, and clothing, then return and come back to Achish.
1 Samuel 27:10 Achish would ask, 'Where did you raid today?' David would answer, 'Against the south of Judah, or against the south of the Jerahmeelites, or against the south of the Kenites.'
1 Samuel 27:11 David would not spare a single man or woman to bring them back to Gath, reasoning: 'Otherwise, they might speak against us and reveal what David truly did.' This was David’s practice for all the time he lived in the land of the Philistines.
1 Samuel 27:12 So Achis believed David, thinking: 'He has truly made himself detestable to his own people, Israel, and so he will be my servant forever.'
1 Samuel 28:1 It happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies to fight against Israel. And Achis said to David: "Know this for sure, you and your men will go out with me into the camp."
1 Samuel 28:2 And David said to Achis: "Now you will see what your servant can do." And Achis said to David: "Then I will make you the guardian of my life for all time."
1 Samuel 28:3 Meanwhile, Samuel had died, and all of Israel mourned for him. They buried him in his city, Ramah. And Saul had removed the mediums and diviners from the land.
1 Samuel 28:4 So the Philistines gathered and came and set up camp in Shunem. Saul also gathered all of Israel and came to Gilboa.
1 Samuel 28:5 And Saul saw the Philistine camp and was greatly afraid; his heart was utterly terrified.
1 Samuel 28:6 So he consulted the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him—not through dreams, nor through priests, nor through prophets.
1 Samuel 28:7 And Saul said to his servants: "Find me a woman who possesses a spirit of divination, so I can go to her and consult through her." And his servants said to him: "There is a woman with a spirit of divination in Endor."
1 Samuel 28:8 So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes. He went with two men, and they came to the woman at night. He said to her: "Divine for me using your spirit, and bring up for me whomever I tell you."
1 Samuel 28:9 And the woman said to him: "Behold, you know what Saul has done, and how he has removed the mediums and diviners from the land. Why then are you setting a trap for my life, so that I may be killed?"
1 Samuel 28:10 And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying: "As the Lord lives, no harm will come to you because of this matter."
1 Samuel 28:11 And the woman said to him: "Whom shall I bring up for you?" And he said: "Bring up Samuel for me."
1 Samuel 28:12 But when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice and said to Saul: "Why have you deceived me, for you are Saul!"
1 Samuel 28:13 And the king said to her: "Do not be afraid. What did you see?" And the woman said to Saul: "I saw divine beings ascending from the earth."
1 Samuel 28:14 He said to her: "What is his appearance?" And she said: "An old man is ascending, and he is wrapped in a cloak." Then Saul understood that it was Samuel, and he bowed himself to the ground and worshipped.
1 Samuel 28:15 But Samuel said to Saul: "Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?" And Saul said: "I am in great distress because the Philistines are fighting against me. Moreover, God has departed from me and will no longer hear me, neither through the hand of prophets nor through dreams. Therefore, I have called you to show me what I should do."
1 Samuel 28:16 And Samuel said: "Why do you ask me, since the Lord has departed from you and has gone over to your neighbor?"
1 Samuel 28:17 For the Lord will do to you exactly as He spoke through me: He will tear the kingdom from your hand and give it to your neighbor, David.
1 Samuel 28:18 Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord, nor did you carry out His fierce anger against Amalek—for this reason, the Lord has done to you what you are suffering now.
1 Samuel 28:19 And the Lord will also give Israel, along with you, into the hand of the Philistines. Therefore, tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me, and the Lord will also give the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel 28:20 Immediately, Saul fell full length upon the ground, for he was greatly terrified because of Samuel's words. And he had no strength in him because he had not eaten any food all that day.
1 Samuel 28:21 So the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly distressed. And she said to him: "Behold, your handmaid obeyed your voice, and I risked my life to listen to the words you spoke to me."
1 Samuel 28:22 Now therefore, you also obey the counsel of your handmaid. Let me place a morsel of bread before you. Eat it so you may be refreshed and able to travel.
1 Samuel 28:23 But he refused and said: "I will not eat." However, his servants and the woman compelled him, and at last he listened to their voice. He rose from the ground and sat upon the couch.
1 Samuel 28:24 Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house. She hurried and killed it, then she took flour and mixed it and baked unleavened bread under the ashes.
1 Samuel 28:25 And she set it before Saul and before his servants. They ate, and then they rose and traveled that same night.
1 Samuel 28:1 It happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies to fight against Israel. Achis then said to David: 'You must know for certain that you and your men will go out with me in the battle camp.'
1 Samuel 28:2 And David said to Achis, 'Now you will see what your servant is able to do.' Achis then said to David, 'Then I will keep you as my personal guard and protect your life every day.'
1 Samuel 28:3 Meanwhile, Samuel had died, and all of Israel mourned for him. They buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had previously removed all the mediums and diviners from the land.
1 Samuel 28:4 So the Philistines gathered and came to encamp in Shunem. But Saul also gathered all of Israel, and they came to Gilboa.
1 Samuel 28:5 And when Saul saw the Philistine camp, he became terrified, and his heart was overwhelmed with fear.
1 Samuel 28:6 So he consulted the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him—neither through dreams, nor through the priests using the Urim and Thummim, nor through prophets.
1 Samuel 28:7 Then Saul said to his servants, 'Search for a woman who has a familiar spirit, and I will go to her to inquire through her.' His servants then told him, 'There is a woman with a familiar spirit in Endor.'
1 Samuel 28:8 So Saul changed his appearance and put on other clothes. Then he, with two men, went and came to the woman by night. And he said to her, 'Perform divination for me by your familiar spirit, and bring up for me the one I will tell you.'
1 Samuel 28:9 And the woman said to him, 'Look, you know what Saul has done and how he has removed the mediums and diviners from the land. Why then are you setting a trap for my life, that I may be killed?'
1 Samuel 28:10 And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, 'As the Lord lives, no harm will come to you because of this matter.'
1 Samuel 28:11 Then the woman said, 'Whom shall I bring up for you?' And he replied, 'Bring up Samuel for me.'
1 Samuel 28:12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. She said to Saul, 'Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!'
1 Samuel 28:13 And the king said to her, 'Do not be afraid. What did you see?' And the woman said to Saul, 'I saw a divine being ascending from the earth.'
1 Samuel 28:14 Then he said to her, 'What is his appearance like?' She replied, 'An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a cloak.' And Saul understood that it was Samuel. He then bowed himself to the ground and paid homage.
1 Samuel 28:15 But Samuel said to Saul, 'Why have you disturbed me, causing me to be brought up?' Saul replied, 'I am in great distress. The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He has answered me nothing, neither through prophets nor through dreams. That is why I have called upon you, so you may show me what I am to do.'
1 Samuel 28:16 And Samuel said, 'Why do you consult me, since the Lord has departed from you and has gone over to your neighbor, David?'
1 Samuel 28:17 For the Lord will do to you exactly what He spoke through me. He will tear the kingdom from your hand and give it to your neighbor, David.
1 Samuel 28:18 Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord, nor did you carry out His fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the Lord has done to you what you now suffer.
1 Samuel 28:19 And the Lord will also give Israel, along with you, into the hand of the Philistines. Tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me in the realm of the dead. And the Lord will deliver the entire army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
1 Samuel 28:20 Immediately, Saul fell full length to the ground, terrified by Samuel's words. He had no strength left in him, for he had eaten no food all that day and night.
1 Samuel 28:21 So the woman came to Saul, seeing that he was greatly troubled. She said to him, 'Look, your handmaid obeyed your voice, and I risked my life by performing this for you, and I listened to your words that you spoke to me.'
1 Samuel 28:22 Now, please listen to your handmaid's voice. Let me set a morsel of bread before you, and eat, so that you may regain your strength and be able to travel.
1 Samuel 28:23 But he refused, saying, 'I will not eat.' However, his servants and the woman urged him strongly. At last, yielding to their persistence, he rose from the ground and sat upon the couch.
1 Samuel 28:24 Now the woman had a fattened ox in her house. She quickly killed it and, taking flour, mixed it and baked unleavened bread under the ashes.
1 Samuel 28:25 And she set it before Saul and his servants. When they had eaten, they rose and departed that very night.
1 Samuel 29:1 So the Philistines gathered all their military companies and forces at Aphek, a strategic location for battle. Meanwhile, the army of Israel set up their camp by the spring located in Jezreel, another key tactical position.
1 Samuel 29:2 The Philistine commanders were marching their troops, arrayed by companies of hundreds and thousands. David and his men were marching at the very rear, accompanying King Achis.
1 Samuel 29:3 Then the Philistine commanders asked, 'Who are these Hebrews joining our ranks?' And Achis responded to the Philistine commanders, saying, 'Is this not David, who was a servant of King Saul of Israel? He has been with me for a long time, for days and years, and I have found no fault in him or any sign of disloyalty since he defected to me until this very day.'
1 Samuel 29:4 However, the Philistine commanders became angry with Achis concerning David. They told him, 'Send this man away. Let him return to the place where you assigned him. He must not go down with us into battle, lest he become our adversary during the fight. How else could he regain favor with his own master, Saul, except by turning against us and sacrificing the lives of these very men?'
1 Samuel 29:5 They further questioned, 'Is this not the same David about whom they sang in their dances, saying: Saul has struck down his thousands, but David his tens of thousands?'
1 Samuel 29:6 So Achis called David and said to him, 'As the Lord lives, you are upright, and you have been good in my sight. Your coming and going with me in the camp has been without issue. I have found nothing evil in you from the day you came to me until this very day. However, you do not please the other Philistine commanders.'
1 Samuel 29:7 'Therefore, turn back now and go in peace. Do not displease the eyes of the Philistine commanders by remaining with us.'
1 Samuel 29:8 David then said to Achis, 'What have I done? Or what fault have you found in your servant from the day I have been in your sight until this very day, that I should not come and fight against the enemies of my lord, the king?'
1 Samuel 29:9 Achis answered David and said, 'I know that you are good in my eyes, as blameless as an angel of God. Nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have declared: He shall not go up with us into battle.'
1 Samuel 29:10 'Therefore, depart early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord, the men who came with you. And when you have risen in the night and dawn begins to break, go your way.'
1 Samuel 29:11 So David and his men rose early in the morning to depart at daybreak and return to the land of the Philistines. Meanwhile, the Philistines themselves marched up to Jezreel, ready for battle.
1 Samuel 29:1 The Philistines gathered all their military divisions at Aphek. But Israel set up their camp by the spring in Jezreel.
1 Samuel 29:2 The Philistine lords marched with their armies, organized into groups of hundreds and thousands. David and his men were bringing up the rear of the military column with Achish.
1 Samuel 29:3 And the Philistine commanders said to Achish, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" Achish replied to the Philistine commanders, "Is this not David, who was a servant of Saul, the king of Israel? He has been with me for many days, even years, and I have found nothing wrong in him since he defected to me, up until this very day."
1 Samuel 29:4 Therefore, the Philistine commanders became angry with Achish and said to him, "Let the man go back and stay in the place where you assigned him. He must not go down with us into battle, lest he become hostile towards us when we are engaged in battle. And how else could he appease his master, if not by turning against these very men of ours?"
1 Samuel 29:5 "Is this not the David about whom they sang in their festive dances, saying: 'Saul has slain a thousand, but David has slain ten thousand'?"
1 Samuel 29:6 So Achish called David and said to him, "As the Lord lives, you are upright and good in my sight. Your conduct, both your coming and going among us in the camp, has been above reproach. I have found nothing wrong in you from the day you came to me until this very day. But you are not pleasing to the Philistine commanders."
1 Samuel 29:7 "Therefore, return and go in peace, so that you do not give offense to the Philistine commanders."
1 Samuel 29:8 David then said to Achish, "What wrong have I done? Or what fault have you found in me, your servant, from the day I first came before you until this very day, that I should not be allowed to come and fight against the enemies of my lord, the king?"
1 Samuel 29:9 Achish answered David, "I know you are good in my eyes, like an angel of God. But the Philistine commanders have plainly declared: 'He must not go up with us into battle.'"
1 Samuel 29:10 "Therefore, rise early in the morning, you and your men who came with you. And as soon as you have risen while it is still dark, and then see the first light of day, you must depart."
1 Samuel 29:11 So David and his men rose early that morning to depart from the land of the Philistines. The Philistines, for their part, advanced into Jezreel.
1 Samuel 30:1 When David and his men arrived back at Ziklag on the third day, they found the city completely raided and burned to the ground by fire.
1 Samuel 30:2 Their wives, sons, and daughters—both the young and the old—had been taken away as captives.
1 Samuel 30:3 So David and all the people with him began to weep loudly, crying until they were completely exhausted and had no more tears left to shed.
1 Samuel 30:4 Among those taken captive were David's two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, who had been Nabal's wife from Carmel.
1 Samuel 30:5 David became terribly distressed because the people began to talk about stoning him, for everyone's spirit was bitter over the loss of their sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the Lord, his God.
1 Samuel 30:6 Then David said to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, 'Bring me the ephod.' So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
1 Samuel 30:7 And David inquired of the Lord, saying, 'Should I pursue these raiders? Will I overtake them or not?' The Lord replied to him, 'Pursue them: for you will surely overtake them and rescue everyone and everything.'
1 Samuel 30:8 So David went, along with the six hundred men who were with him. And they came to the Wadi Besor, where some of the exhausted men rested there.
1 Samuel 30:9 David continued the pursuit with four hundred men, while the two hundred who were too weary to cross the Wadi Besor remained behind.
1 Samuel 30:10 They found an Egyptian man out in a field and brought him to David. They gave him some bread to eat and water to drink,
1 Samuel 30:11 They also gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins. After he ate, his spirit returned to him, and he was revived, because he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three full days and three full nights.
1 Samuel 30:12 David then asked him, 'Whose servant are you? Where do you come from? And where are you going?' The Egyptian replied, 'I am a young Egyptian man, a servant of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me three days ago because I became ill.'
1 Samuel 30:13 He continued, 'Indeed, we raided the Negev of the Cherethites, and the territory against Judah, and the territory against Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.'
1 Samuel 30:14 David asked him, 'Can you lead me to this raiding party?' The Egyptian answered, 'If you swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, I will lead you to this party.'
1 Samuel 30:15 So David swore to him. And the Egyptian led him, and there the raiders were, scattered across the entire open country, eating, and drinking, and celebrating as if it were a feast day, because of all the great plunder and spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
1 Samuel 30:16 And David attacked them from dawn until the evening of the next day, and not a single one of them escaped, except four hundred young men who had mounted camels and fled.
1 Samuel 30:17 And David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, from his own wives down to the little ones. They had plundered absolutely nothing of the smaller or larger items, nor of the sons and daughters, nor of the spoil, nor of anything else they had carried off. David had brought everything back.
1 Samuel 30:18 They also drove away all the flocks and herds. And concerning that plunder, they declared, 'This is David's plunder!'
1 Samuel 30:19 When David returned, he came to the two hundred men who had been too weary to follow him, and whom he had made to stay by the Wadi Besor. They came out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him.
1 Samuel 30:20 As David approached the people, he greeted them peacefully.
1 Samuel 30:21 But every wicked and worthless man among the men who had gone with David responded, saying, 'Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any part of the plunder we recovered. Rather, let it be enough for each man to take his wife and children; when they have them, they can leave.'
1 Samuel 30:22 But David said, 'My brothers, you must not do this with what the Lord has given us. He protected us, and delivered the raiders who attacked us into our hands.'
1 Samuel 30:23 Nor should anyone listen to you concerning this matter: for the share will be equal for those who went down to the battle and for those who remained with the supplies. They shall divide it similarly.'
1 Samuel 30:24 And it came to pass that, from that time and up to the present day, this was established as a statute, and a judgment, and a just custom in Israel.
1 Samuel 30:25 So David came to Ziklag and sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, 'Accept this blessing from the Lord's plunder!'
1 Samuel 30:26 He sent portions to those who were in Bethel, to those in Ramoth in the Negev, and to those in Jattir,
1 Samuel 30:27 and to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa,
1 Samuel 30:28 and to those in Racal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,
1 Samuel 30:29 and to those in Hormah, and to those in Borashan, and to those in Athach,
1 Samuel 30:30 and to those in Hebron, and to all the remaining places in which David himself and his men had lived and traveled.
1 Samuel 30:1 When David and his men returned to Ziklag on the third day, they discovered that the Amalekites had launched a surprise attack into the southern region and Ziklag itself. The Amalekites had raided Ziklag, and they had set the entire place on fire.
1 Samuel 30:2 They had also taken the women captive, and everyone else who was there—from the youngest child to the oldest person. They hadn't killed anyone, but they had taken them all away.
1 Samuel 30:3 So David and his men came to the city, and behold, it had been burned down with fire. Their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive.
1 Samuel 30:4 Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they could no longer shed tears.
1 Samuel 30:5 For David's two wives had also been taken captive: Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail, Nabal the Carmelite's wife.
1 Samuel 30:6 And David was greatly distressed, because the people were planning to stone him. For every man was bitter in his soul over his sons and his daughters. Yet, David strengthened himself in the Lord, his God.
1 Samuel 30:7 Then David said to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, 'Bring me the ephod.' And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
1 Samuel 30:8 And David inquired of the Lord, saying, 'Should I pursue these raiders? Will I overtake them, or not?' And the Lord said to him, 'Pursue them, because you will surely overtake them and rescue everyone.'
1 Samuel 30:9 So David went, along with the six hundred men who were with him. They came as far as the Wadi Besor, where some of the men, exhausted, stayed behind.
1 Samuel 30:10 But David pursued with four hundred men, for two hundred men had stayed behind because they were too weak and could not cross the Wadi Besor.
1 Samuel 30:11 And they found an Egyptian man in the field and brought him to David. They gave him bread to eat and water to drink,
1 Samuel 30:12 And they also gave him a piece of fig cake and two clusters of raisins. When he had eaten these, his spirit returned to him and he was refreshed, for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.
1 Samuel 30:13 Then David said to him, 'Whose are you, and where are you from?' He replied, 'I am a young Egyptian man, a servant of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me because I became ill three days ago.'
1 Samuel 30:14 Indeed, we raided the southern region of the Cherethites, and against Judah, and the southern part of Caleb's territory, and we burned Ziklag with fire.
1 Samuel 30:15 David asked him, 'Can you lead me to this raiding party?' He replied, 'Swear to me by God that you will not kill me, and that you will not hand me over to my master, and I will lead you to this raiding party.'
1 Samuel 30:16 And he led him. And behold, they were spread out over the surface of the entire land, eating and drinking, and celebrating as if it were a festival, because of all the plunder and spoils they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
1 Samuel 30:17 And David struck them from dawn until the evening of the next day. No one escaped from them, except four hundred young men who mounted camels and fled.
1 Samuel 30:18 And David rescued everything the Amalekites had taken. David also rescued his two wives.
1 Samuel 30:19 And nothing was missing for them, from the least to the greatest, neither sons nor daughters, nor spoils, nor anything else they had stolen. David brought everything back.
1 Samuel 30:20 And David took all the flocks and herds, and drove them before him. And the people said, 'This is David's plunder.'
1 Samuel 30:21 Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to continue and had not been able to cross the Wadi Besor. They came out to meet David and the people who were with him. And when David approached the men, he greeted them peacefully.
1 Samuel 30:22 Then every wicked and evil man among those who had gone with David responded, saying, 'Because they didn't go with us, we will give them nothing from the plunder we rescued. Let each man just take his wife and children and go away.'
1 Samuel 30:23 But David said, 'You shall not do this, my brothers, after the Lord has saved us and delivered into our hands the raiders who attacked us.'
1 Samuel 30:24 And no one will listen to you in this matter. For the share will be equal for the one who goes down to battle and the one who remains with the baggage. They shall divide it equally.
1 Samuel 30:25 And from that day forward, this was established and commanded as a law, and it has set a standard of justice in Israel even to this present day.
1 Samuel 30:26 When David returned to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, his close associates, saying, 'Receive a blessing from the Lord's plunder.'
1 Samuel 30:27 To those in Bethel, and to those in Ramoth of the Negev (the southern region), and to those in Jattir,
1 Samuel 30:28 And to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa,
1 Samuel 30:29 And to those in Rachal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,
1 Samuel 30:30 And to those in Hormah, and to those in Bor-ashan, and to those in Athach,
1 Samuel 30:31 And to those in Hebron, and in all the other places where David himself and his men had stayed.
1 Samuel 31:1 The Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from the Philistines. Many of them were killed on Mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel 31:2 The Philistines attacked Saul and his sons. They killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, all sons of Saul.
1 Samuel 31:3 The battle raged fiercely around Saul. The archers, skilled with their bows, found him and wounded him severely with their arrows.
1 Samuel 31:4 Saul said to his armor-bearer: "Draw your sword and kill me, so that these uncircumcised Philistines do not come and kill me and make sport of me." But his armor-bearer refused, because he was terrified by the great fear. So Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
1 Samuel 31:5 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his own sword and died with him.
1 Samuel 31:6 So Saul died, along with his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men died together on that day.
1 Samuel 31:7 But the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those beyond the Jordan River, saw that the men of Israel had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead. They abandoned their cities and fled. Then the Philistines came and settled in those places.
1 Samuel 31:8 On the next day, the Philistines came to strip the bodies of the slain. They found Saul and his three sons lying dead on Mount Gilboa.
1 Samuel 31:9 They cut off Saul's head and stripped him of his armor. Then they sent messengers throughout the Philistine land to announce the news in the temples of their idols and to their people.
1 Samuel 31:10 They placed Saul's armor in the temple of Astaroth, and they hung his body on the wall of Beth-shan.
1 Samuel 31:11 But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
1 Samuel 31:12 all their valiant men rose up and marched all night. They took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. Then they came to Jabesh-Gilead and burned the bodies there.
1 Samuel 31:13 And they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted for seven days.
2 Samuel 1:1 Now, after King Saul had died, David returned from his victory over the Amalekites. He then remained in Ziklag for two days.
2 Samuel 1:2 On the third day, a man appeared, coming from Saul's military camp. His clothes were torn, and dust covered his head, showing his distress and mourning. When he came to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself in homage.
2 Samuel 1:3 David asked him: "Where do you come from?" And the man replied: "I have escaped from the Israelite camp."
2 Samuel 1:4 And David asked him: "What is this news you bring, what has happened? Tell me." The man said: "The people have fled from the battle, and many have fallen and died. Even King Saul and his son Jonathan have perished."
2 Samuel 1:5 David then asked the young man who was reporting this to him: "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
2 Samuel 1:6 And the young man who was bringing him the news said: "By chance, I came upon Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul, leaning upon his spear. The chariots and horsemen of the enemy were drawing closer to him."
2 Samuel 1:7 When Saul looked behind himself, he saw me and called out. When I answered him, saying, 'Here I am,' he spoke to me, saying: 'Kill me, for I am in great distress, and yet my life is still in me.'"
2 Samuel 1:8 He said to me: 'Who are you?' And I said to him: 'I am an Amalekite.'
2 Samuel 1:9 And he spoke to me, saying: 'Kill me, for I am in great distress, and yet my life is still in me.'
2 Samuel 1:10 So I stood over him and killed him, for I knew that he could not survive his fall. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm, and I have brought them here to you, my lord."
2 Samuel 1:11 Then David seized his own clothes and tore them, and all the men who were with him did likewise as a sign of deep mourning.
2 Samuel 1:12 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening over Saul, and over his son Jonathan, and over the people of the Lord, and over the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword in battle.
2 Samuel 1:13 Then David asked the young man who had brought him the news: "Where are you from?" He replied: "I am the son of a foreign man, an Amalekite."
2 Samuel 1:14 And David said to him: "Why were you not afraid to lay your hand on the Lord's anointed and kill him?" This means David was asking why the man wasn't afraid to violate God's sacred order.
2 Samuel 1:15 Then David called one of his young men and said: "Go near and execute him." So the young man struck him down, and he died.
2 Samuel 1:16 And David said to the Amalekite: "Your blood is on your own head, for your own mouth testified against you when you said: 'I killed the Lord's anointed.'"
2 Samuel 1:17 Then David chanted this lament over Saul and over his son Jonathan.
2 Samuel 1:18 And he commanded that the children of Judah be taught this lament, which is recorded in the Book of Jashar, a collection of heroic deeds.
2 Samuel 1:19 O, the glory of Israel lies slain upon your mountains, O Gilboa! How have the mighty fallen?
2 Samuel 1:20 Do not declare it in Gath, nor announce it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
2 Samuel 1:21 O mountains of Gilboa, may no dew or rain fall upon you, nor may there be fields that yield first fruits. For there, the shield of the mighty was cast away, the shield of Saul, as if it had never been anointed with oil for battle.
2 Samuel 1:22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty warriors, the arrow of Jonathan never turned back without striking, and the sword of Saul never returned empty.
2 Samuel 1:23 Saul and Jonathan, beloved and beautiful in their lives, even in death they were not separated. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
2 Samuel 1:24 O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.
2 Samuel 1:25 How have the mighty fallen in battle? Jonathan lies slain on your high places.
2 Samuel 1:26 I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan. You were exceedingly delightful to me, and your love for me was more precious than the love of women. Just as a mother loves her only son, so I cherished you.
2 Samuel 1:27 How have the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished?
2 Samuel 1:1 After Saul had died, David returned from his conquest of the Amalekites, and he stayed in Ziklag for two days.
2 Samuel 1:2 And on the third day, a man appeared. He was coming from Saul's camp. His clothes were torn, and his head was covered with dust. When he came to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself in homage.
2 Samuel 1:3 David asked him, "Where are you coming from?" The man replied to him, "I have fled from the camp of Israel."
2 Samuel 1:4 David said to him, "What news has happened? Tell me." The man replied, "The people have fled from the battle, and many have fallen and died. Even Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."
2 Samuel 1:5 David said to the young man who was bringing him the news, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
2 Samuel 1:6 The young man who was bringing the news said, "By chance, I came upon Mount Gilboa. Saul was leaning upon his spear, while chariots and horsemen were drawing near to him."
2 Samuel 1:7 "When he looked behind himself, he saw me and called out. I replied, 'Here I am.'"
2 Samuel 1:8 "He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'"
2 Samuel 1:9 "He said to me, 'Stand over me and kill me, because great anguish holds me, and my life is still completely within me.'"
2 Samuel 1:10 "So, standing over him, I killed him, for I knew that he could not live after his fall. I then took the crown from his head and the armlet from his arm, and I have brought them here to you, my lord."
2 Samuel 1:11 Then David took hold of his own clothes and tore them. All the men who were with him did the same.
2 Samuel 1:12 They lamented and wept and fasted until evening over Saul, and over his son Jonathan, and over the Lord's people, and over the house of Israel, because they had died in battle.
2 Samuel 1:13 David then said to the young man who had brought him the news, "Where are you from?" He answered, "I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite."
2 Samuel 1:14 David said to him, "Why did you not fear to stretch out your hand to kill the Lord's anointed?"
2 Samuel 1:15 Then David called one of his young men, saying, "Come here and strike him down." The young man struck him, and he died.
2 Samuel 1:16 David said to him, "Your blood is upon your own head. For your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the Lord's anointed.'"
2 Samuel 1:17 David then uttered this lamentation over Saul and over his son Jonathan:
2 Samuel 1:18 He commanded that the sons of Judah should be taught this lamentation, called 'the Bow.' Indeed, it is written in the Book of Jashar:
2 Samuel 1:19 "The glory of Israel is slain upon your mountains! How have the mighty fallen!"
2 Samuel 1:20 "Do not announce it in Gath, nor proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
2 Samuel 1:21 "O mountains of Gilboa, may no dew nor rain come upon you, nor fields that bear offerings, for there the shield of the mighty was cast away—the shield of Saul, as if he had not been anointed with oil."
2 Samuel 1:22 "From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the arrow of Jonathan never returned without striking, and the sword of Saul never returned empty."
2 Samuel 1:23 "Saul and Jonathan, beloved and beautiful in their lives, in death also they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles, and stronger than lions."
2 Samuel 1:24 "O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in luxurious scarlet and provided golden ornaments for your garments."
2 Samuel 1:25 "How have the mighty fallen in battle! Jonathan is slain upon your high places!"
2 Samuel 1:26 "I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan, most beautiful, and more beloved than all the love of women, a love that surpassed even romantic love."
2 Samuel 1:27 "How have the mighty fallen, and how have the weapons of war perished!"
2 Samuel 2:1 After this, David consulted the Lord, saying: "Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" And the Lord said to him: "Go up." Then David asked again: "Where should I go up?" And the Lord answered him: "To Hebron."
2 Samuel 2:2 So David went up there, along with his two wives: Achinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, who had been the wife of Nabal of Carmel.
2 Samuel 2:3 And David also brought the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in the cities around Hebron.
2 Samuel 2:4 Then the men of Judah came and anointed David there to reign over the house of Judah. And it was reported to David that the men of Jabesh-Gilead had buried Saul.
2 Samuel 2:5 So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead and said to them: "May you be blessed by the Lord, because you showed this kindness to your lord Saul by burying him."
2 Samuel 2:6 And now, may the Lord repay you with kindness and truth. And I myself will also reward you with good because you have done this deed.
2 Samuel 2:7 Therefore, strengthen your hands and be courageous men, for your lord Saul is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me as their king.
2 Samuel 2:8 However, Abner, the son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul's army, took Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and brought him into a fortified camp.
2 Samuel 2:9 And he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all of Israel.
2 Samuel 2:10 Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.
2 Samuel 2:11 And the number of days that David reigned in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2 Samuel 2:12 Then Abner, the son of Ner, and the men of Ishbosheth, Saul's son, went out from the fortified camp to Gibeon.
2 Samuel 2:13 And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and David's men went out from Hebron. They met them by the pool of Gibeon, and when they had gathered in one place, some sat on one side of the pool, and the others sat on the opposite side.
2 Samuel 2:14 Then Abner said to Joab: "Let the young men rise up and fight before us." And Joab answered: "Let them rise up."
2 Samuel 2:15 So they rose up: twelve men chosen by David, and twelve men from Benjamin who fought for Ishbosheth, Saul's son.
2 Samuel 2:16 And each man grasped his opponent's head and thrust his sword into his adversary, and they all fell down together. So the name of that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
2 Samuel 2:17 And a very fierce battle took place on that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were struck down by David's men.
2 Samuel 2:18 Now there were three sons of Zeruiah there: Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was as swift of foot as one of the wild gazelles.
2 Samuel 2:19 Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left, following closely behind Abner.
2 Samuel 2:20 So Abner turned around, looking back, and said: "Are you Asahel?" And he answered: "I am."
2 Samuel 2:21 And Abner said to him: "Turn away from pursuing me and seize one of the younger men, and take his spoils for yourself." But Asahel would not leave him, but continued to press after him.
2 Samuel 2:22 Again Abner spoke to Asahel, saying: "Turn away, do not pursue me, lest I be compelled to strike you down to the ground. Then I would not be able to look your brother Joab in the face."
2 Samuel 2:23 But Asahel, refusing to turn away, was struck by Abner in the stomach, below the armpit, and died there. And everyone who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died stopped.
2 Samuel 2:24 Then Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. When the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is opposite the valley and the road to the desert of Gibeon.
2 Samuel 2:25 However, the sons of Benjamin gathered together with Abner and formed a single company, standing on the top of a hill.
2 Samuel 2:26 Then Abner cried out to Joab and said: "Will your sword rage until complete destruction? Do you not know that desperation is dangerous? How long will you not tell the people to stop pursuing their brothers?"
2 Samuel 2:27 And Joab said: "As the Lord lives, if you had spoken, all the people would have stopped pursuing their brothers from early morning."
2 Samuel 2:28 Then Joab blew the trumpet, and all the army stopped. They no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight any more.
2 Samuel 2:29 But Abner and his men marched through the plain all that night. They crossed the Jordan, and after passing through all of Beth-horon, they came to their fortified camp.
2 Samuel 2:30 Joab also returned, abandoning the pursuit of Abner, and gathered all the army. Nineteen men from David's followers were missing, besides Asahel.
2 Samuel 2:31 However, David's men had struck down three hundred and sixty men from Benjamin and from Abner's men, all of whom died.
2 Samuel 2:32 And they took Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men traveled all night, and dawn broke for them in Hebron.
2 Samuel 2:1 After these events, David sought guidance from the Lord, asking, 'Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?' And the Lord spoke to him, saying, 'Go up.' David then asked, 'Where should I go up?' And the Lord said, 'To Hebron.'
2 Samuel 2:2 So David went up, along with his two wives: Ahinoam, the woman from Jezreel, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
2 Samuel 2:3 David also brought the men who were with him, each with their own household, and they settled in the various towns within the region of Hebron.
2 Samuel 2:4 Then the men of Judah came and anointed David there to be king over the house of Judah. And it was reported to David that the men of Jabesh-Gilead had buried Saul.
2 Samuel 2:5 So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and said to them: 'May you be blessed by the Lord, you who have shown such loyalty to your lord Saul, by burying him.'
2 Samuel 2:6 And now, may the Lord repay you with His grace and faithfulness. Indeed, I myself will also reward you with good, because you have done this deed.
2 Samuel 2:7 Therefore, strengthen your hands, and be strong, courageous men. For your lord Saul is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me as their king.
2 Samuel 2:8 Now Abner, the son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul’s army, took Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, and brought him through the encampments of Israel.
2 Samuel 2:9 And Abner made Ishbosheth king over Gilead, and over the Geshurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all of the tribes of Israel outside of Judah.
2 Samuel 2:10 Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.
2 Samuel 2:11 And the total number of days that David reigned in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2 Samuel 2:12 Then Abner, the son of Ner, along with the servants of Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
2 Samuel 2:13 And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, along with David’s servants, went out from Hebron. They met Abner and his men by the Pool of Gibeon, and they sat down, some on one side of the pool, and some on the other.
2 Samuel 2:14 And Abner said to Joab, 'Let the young men rise and play a contest before us.' And Joab responded, 'Let them rise.'
2 Samuel 2:15 So they rose and passed over: twelve men from Benjamin, from the side of Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, and twelve of David’s servants.
2 Samuel 2:16 Each man grabbed his opponent by the head, and they thrust their swords into each other's sides, so they all fell down together and died. And the name of that place was called 'Field of Swords' or 'Field of Sharp Edges' in Gibeon, commemorating this bloody duel.
2 Samuel 2:17 And a very fierce battle ensued on that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated and fled from David’s servants.
2 Samuel 2:18 Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. And Asahel was as swift of foot as a gazelle in the open fields.
2 Samuel 2:19 Asahel pursued Abner, and he did not turn to the right or to the left from chasing after Abner.
2 Samuel 2:20 So Abner looked back over his shoulder and said, 'Are you Asahel?' And he answered, 'I am.'
2 Samuel 2:21 And Abner said to him, 'Turn aside to the right or to the left, and seize one of the younger men and take his armor and plunder for yourself.' But Asahel was unwilling to turn back from him, and Abner continued to insist that he stop chasing him.
2 Samuel 2:22 Abner spoke again to Asahel, saying, 'Stop pursuing me! I do not want to be forced to strike you down to the ground. If I do, how could I ever face your brother Joab again, knowing I killed his brother?'
2 Samuel 2:23 But Asahel disdained to listen and would not turn aside. So Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt-end of his spear, and Asahel was pierced through and died in that very spot. And all who passed by the place where Asahel’s body lay, stopped and gathered there.
2 Samuel 2:24 However, Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And the sun had set when they reached the hill of Ammah, which is opposite Giah, on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
2 Samuel 2:25 And so the sons of Benjamin gathered together with Abner; they formed one compact fighting unit and took a stand on the top of a small hill.
2 Samuel 2:26 And Abner called out to Joab, saying, 'Will your sword rage on to utter destruction forever? Do you not know that desperation is dangerous? How long will it be until you tell the people to stop pursuing their own brothers, the people of Israel?'
2 Samuel 2:27 And Joab said, 'As the Lord lives, if you had not spoken up, then by morning all the people would have seen that each man would have abandoned his pursuit of his brother.'
2 Samuel 2:28 Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the army stood still. They no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight any longer.
2 Samuel 2:29 But Abner and his men marched through the valley all that night, and they crossed the Jordan River. They journeyed through all of Beth-Horon, and then they came to Mahanaim.
2 Samuel 2:30 Joab also returned from pursuing Abner and gathered all the army. And nineteen men were missing from David’s servants, besides Asahel, who was already accounted for.
2 Samuel 2:31 But David’s servants had struck down three hundred and sixty men from Benjamin and from Abner’s men, and all of those men were dead.
2 Samuel 2:32 Then they took Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb in Bethlehem. And Joab and the men who were with him marched all night, and the sun rose upon them as they arrived in Hebron.
2 Samuel 3:1 There was a long war between Saul's royal house and David's royal house. David was making progress and becoming stronger, but Saul's royal house was losing power every day.
2 Samuel 3:2 Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, born of Ahinoam from Jezreel.
2 Samuel 3:3 His second son was Chileab, born of Abigail, who had been Nabal the Carmelite's wife. And his third son was Absalom, the son of Maacah, who was the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.
2 Samuel 3:4 His fourth son was Adonijah, the son of Haggith. And his fifth son was Shephatiah, the son of Abital.
2 Samuel 3:5 His sixth son was Ithream, born of Eglah, another of David's wives. These sons were all born to David in Hebron.
2 Samuel 3:6 During the war between Saul's royal house and David's royal house, Abner, son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul's army, grew very powerful in support of Saul's house.
2 Samuel 3:7 Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth, Saul's son and successor, asked Abner, "Why did you have relations with my father's concubine?"
2 Samuel 3:8 Abner became very angry over Ish-bosheth's words and responded, "Am I a dog's head from Judah? I am the one showing loyalty to the house of your father Saul today, and to his brothers and his friends, and I have not handed you over to David's power. Yet today you accuse me of a sin concerning a woman?"
2 Samuel 3:9 Then Abner swore an oath, saying, "May God do so to Abner, and even more, if I do not act according to what the Lord swore to David and make it happen for him.
2 Samuel 3:10 My goal is to transfer the kingdom from Saul's royal house and establish David's throne over both Israel and Judah, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south."
2 Samuel 3:11 Ish-bosheth could not say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.
2 Samuel 3:12 So Abner sent messengers to David, on his own behalf, saying, "To whom does the land truly belong?" He also said, "Make a covenant with me, and my hand will be with you, and I will bring all of Israel to you."
2 Samuel 3:13 David replied, "Good. I will make a covenant with you, but I demand one thing from you. You will not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me."
2 Samuel 3:14 David then sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Return my wife Michal to me, whom I acquired as my betrothed by providing one hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
2 Samuel 3:15 So Ish-bosheth sent men and took her away from her husband, Paltiel, the son of Laish.
2 Samuel 3:16 Her husband followed her, weeping, all the way to Bahurim. But Abner said to him, "Go back now; turn around." And so he went back.
2 Samuel 3:17 Abner had also spoken to the elders of Israel, saying, "For a long time now, you have desired David to reign over you.
2 Samuel 3:18 Now therefore, act upon it. For the Lord has spoken concerning David, saying, 'By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from all their enemies.'"
2 Samuel 3:19 Abner also spoke directly to the tribe of Benjamin. Then he went to David in Hebron to report everything that pleased Israel and the entire house of Benjamin.
2 Samuel 3:20 So Abner came to David in Hebron with twenty men. And David prepared a feast for Abner and the men who had come with him.
2 Samuel 3:21 Abner said to David, "I will rise and gather all Israel to you, my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and you may rule over all of them, just as your heart desires." Then David sent Abner away, and he departed in peace.
2 Samuel 3:22 Just as David's servants and Joab returned from a successful raid, bringing much plunder, they found that Abner was no longer in Hebron. Indeed, David had sent him away, and he had departed in peace.
2 Samuel 3:23 Joab went in to the king and said, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why did you let him leave and depart?
2 Samuel 3:24 You don't know Abner, son of Ner, that he came to you only to deceive you, to find out your movements, your comings and goings, and everything you are doing?"
2 Samuel 3:25 And Joab, having left David's presence, sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah, without David knowing it.
2 Samuel 3:26 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab led him aside to the gate, as if to speak to him privately, and there he struck him in the side, and he died. This was for the blood of Asahel, Joab's brother, whom Abner had killed in battle.
2 Samuel 3:27 After this, David heard the news and declared, "I am innocent, and my kingdom is innocent before the Lord forever, of the blood of Abner, son of Ner.
2 Samuel 3:28 May his blood come upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house. May there never cease from Joab's house someone with a discharge, or a leper, or one who holds a spindle (a woman's work, implying weakness), or one who falls by the sword, or one who lacks bread."
2 Samuel 3:29 So Joab and Abishai, his brother, killed Abner because he had killed Asahel, their brother, in the battle at Gibeon.
2 Samuel 3:30 Then David commanded Joab and all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner." And King David himself followed the bier.
2 Samuel 3:31 They buried Abner in Hebron. The king raised his voice and wept at Abner's tomb. And all the people also wept.
2 Samuel 3:32 And all the people tried to persuade David to eat some food. But David swore an oath, saying, "May God do so to me, and even more, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets."
2 Samuel 3:33 All the people took notice of this, and they were pleased. For everything the king did was pleasing in the sight of all the people.
2 Samuel 3:34 And all the people and all Israel understood that day that the king had not been responsible for the killing of Abner, son of Ner.
2 Samuel 3:35 The king said to his servants, weeping, "Do you not know that a prince, a very great man, has fallen this day in Israel?"
2 Samuel 3:36 David continued, "Even though I am anointed by God, I feel weak and vulnerable today, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too severe for me. May the Lord repay the evildoer according to his wickedness."
2 Samuel 3:37 And all the people and all Israel knew that day that it was not by the king's doing that Abner, son of Ner, was killed.
2 Samuel 3:38 The king had also said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel?"
2 Samuel 3:39 Furthermore, I am delicate (vulnerable) today, though I am an anointed king. And these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me. May the Lord repay the one who does evil according to his wickedness.
2 Samuel 3:1 So there was a long war between the royal house of Saul and the royal house of David. David grew in strength and became ever more powerful, while the house of Saul weakened daily.
2 Samuel 3:2 Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, born from Ahinoam, the Jezreelitess.
2 Samuel 3:3 His second son was Chileab, born from Abigail, Nabal the Carmelite's widow. His third son was Absalom, born from Maacah, who was the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.
2 Samuel 3:4 His fourth son was Adonijah, born from Haggith. His fifth son was Shephatiah, born from Abital.
2 Samuel 3:5 And his sixth son was Ithream, born from Eglah, another one of David's wives. These sons were all born to David in Hebron, while he reigned there.
2 Samuel 3:6 While the war was ongoing between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner, son of Ner, who was the commander of Saul's army, acted with increasing defiance on behalf of Saul's house.
2 Samuel 3:7 Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth accused Abner, saying, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine? That makes you a claimant to his throne."
2 Samuel 3:8 Abner became extremely angry because of Ish-bosheth's words and responded, "Am I a dog's head, deserving of such an insult? This very day I am loyal to Judah! I have shown mercy to the house of your father Saul, and to his brothers and kinsmen, and I haven't handed you over to David's control! Yet you accuse me today of a sin with a woman?"
2 Samuel 3:9 Abner swore an oath, saying, "May God do this to Abner, and more also, if I do not act exactly as the Lord swore to David."
2 Samuel 3:10 "That is, I will transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over all of Israel and Judah, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south."
2 Samuel 3:11 Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner a single word because he was afraid of him.
2 Samuel 3:12 So Abner immediately sent messengers to David, saying on his own behalf, "To whom does the land truly belong? Make a covenant with me, and behold, I am ready to help you turn all of Israel over to your rule."
2 Samuel 3:13 David replied, "Good, I will make a covenant with you. But I demand one thing from you: you will not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me."
2 Samuel 3:14 David also sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me back my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of one hundred Philistine foreskins."
2 Samuel 3:15 So Ish-bosheth sent for her and took her away from her husband, Paltiel, son of Laish.
2 Samuel 3:16 Her husband followed her, weeping as he went, all the way to Bahurim. Abner said to him, "Go back!" So he returned.
2 Samuel 3:17 Abner also spoke to the elders of Israel, saying, "Both yesterday and the day before, you were seeking to have David reign over you."
2 Samuel 3:18 "Now therefore, act upon it, for the Lord has spoken concerning David, saying, 'By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'"
2 Samuel 3:19 Abner also spoke to the tribe of Benjamin. Then he went to speak to David in Hebron, conveying all that had pleased Israel and the entire tribe of Benjamin.
2 Samuel 3:20 So Abner came to David in Hebron, with twenty men accompanying him. David held a feast for Abner and the men who had come with him.
2 Samuel 3:21 Abner said to David, "I will go now and gather all Israel to you, my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and you may rule over all of them, just as your heart desires." David then sent Abner away, and he departed in peace.
2 Samuel 3:22 Just then, David's servants and Joab returned from a raid, bringing many spoils with them. Abner, however, was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had departed in peace.
2 Samuel 3:23 When Joab arrived, he was told, "Abner, son of Ner, came to the king, and the king sent him away, and he departed in peace."
2 Samuel 3:24 Joab went in to the king and asked, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you! Why did you send him away so that he just left?"
2 Samuel 3:25 "Don't you know Abner, son of Ner? He came to you only to deceive you, to learn your coming and going, and to discover all your plans."
2 Samuel 3:26 After Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah, but David did not know about it.
2 Samuel 3:27 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside inside the gate, as if to speak to him privately. There, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died, in revenge for the blood of Asahel, Joab's brother.
2 Samuel 3:28 When David heard of it afterward, he declared, "I and my kingdom are innocent before the Lord forever concerning the blood of Abner, son of Ner."
2 Samuel 3:29 "May the guilt for Abner's death fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house. May the house of Joab never lack someone afflicted with a discharge, or a leper, or one who holds a distaff, or one who falls by the sword, or one who lacks bread."
2 Samuel 3:30 So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because Abner had killed their brother Asahel in battle at Gibeon.
2 Samuel 3:31 Then David commanded Joab and all the people who were with him, saying, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner." And King David himself followed the bier.
2 Samuel 3:32 When they had buried Abner in Hebron, the king lifted his voice and wept at Abner's tomb. All the people also wept.
2 Samuel 3:33 And the king lamented and said, "Should Abner have died like a fool?"
2 Samuel 3:34 "Your hands were not bound, nor your feet shackled. You fell as a wicked man falls, before treacherous men." And all the people wept over him again.
2 Samuel 3:35 All the people came to offer David food while it was still daylight, but David swore an oath, saying, "May God do this to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets."
2 Samuel 3:36 All the people understood this, and it pleased them; indeed, everything the king did was pleasing in the sight of all the people.
2 Samuel 3:37 So all the people and all of Israel understood that day that the killing of Abner, son of Ner, had not been the king's doing.
2 Samuel 3:38 The king also said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?"
2 Samuel 3:39 "And though I am still weak and newly anointed as king, these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me to control. May the Lord repay the evil-doer according to his wickedness."
2 Samuel 4:1 When Saul's son, Ishbaal, heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost all courage, and all of Israel was troubled by this news.
2 Samuel 4:2 Now, Saul's son had two captains of his raiding bands: one was named Baanah, and the other was Rechab. They were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin; Beeroth itself was also considered part of Benjamin.
2 Samuel 4:3 The Beerothites had fled to Gittaim and lived there as foreign residents up until that time.
2 Samuel 4:4 Now, Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news came from Jezreel about Saul and Jonathan. His nurse picked him up and carried him, but as she hurried to flee, she fell, and he became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel 4:5 So Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, went and came to Ishbaal's house during the heat of the day. Ishbaal was sleeping on his bed at noon.
2 Samuel 4:6 And behold, the doorkeeper of the house, who was cleaning wheat, had fallen asleep. So these men, secretly bringing in their hands through the doorway, struck him in the stomach and fled.
2 Samuel 4:7 For when they had entered the house, he was sleeping on his bed in the inner chamber. They struck him and killed him. Then they took his head and went away by the desert road all night long.
2 Samuel 4:8 They brought the head of Ishbaal to David in Hebron and said to the king: 'Behold, here is the head of Ishbaal, son of Saul, your enemy, who sought to kill you. The Lord has today given our lord the king vengeance on Saul and his descendants.'
2 Samuel 4:9 But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them: 'As the Lord lives, who has rescued my life from all distress—'
2 Samuel 4:10 '—when someone told me that Saul was dead, thinking he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag. That man thought he deserved a reward for his message!'
2 Samuel 4:11 'How much more then should I punish you, wicked men, who have killed a righteous man in his own house, on his own bed? Therefore, I will now demand his blood from your hands and remove you from the earth.'
2 Samuel 4:12 Then David commanded his young men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies over the pool in Hebron. But they took Ishbaal's head and buried it in Abner's tomb in Hebron.
2 Samuel 4:1 But Ishbosheth, who was Saul’s son, heard the news that Abner had been killed in Hebron. Ishbosheth then became utterly powerless to act, and all of Israel became fearful and in turmoil.
2 Samuel 4:2 Now, two men who were commanders of raiding parties were serving Saul’s son. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab; they were the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the tribe of Benjamin—for Beeroth was also accounted as part of Benjamin.
2 Samuel 4:3 The Beerothites had fled to Gittaim and had lived there as foreigners up until that very day.
2 Samuel 4:4 Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was disabled in his feet. He was five years old when the news came from Jezreel about Saul and Jonathan’s deaths. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to escape, he fell and became lame. His name was Meribbaal.
2 Samuel 4:5 So, Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out and went into Ishbosheth’s house during the heat of the day, while he was taking his noonday nap.
2 Samuel 4:6 And behold, the woman who guarded the entrance to the house was sifting wheat and had fallen asleep. So, Rechab and his brother Baanah secretly entered, struck Ishbosheth in the stomach, and then fled.
2 Samuel 4:7 Indeed, when they had entered the house, Ishbosheth was sleeping on his bed in his inner chamber. They struck him and killed him. Then, taking his head, they departed by way of the desert road throughout the entire night.
2 Samuel 4:8 They brought Ishbosheth’s head to David in Hebron and said to the king, “Behold, here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life. Today, the Lord has granted vengeance to my lord the king against Saul and his descendants.”
2 Samuel 4:9 David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the Lord lives, who has delivered my soul from all distress and trouble—”
2 Samuel 4:10 “—for the man who announced to me that Saul was dead, thinking he was bringing good news, I seized him and killed him in Ziklag. I should have given him a reward for his message, but instead, he died for it.”
2 Samuel 4:11 “How much more, then, when wicked men have murdered an innocent man in his own home, on his own bed, shall I not demand his blood from your hands and utterly remove you from the face of the earth?”
2 Samuel 4:12 So David commanded his young men, and they executed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron. But Ishbosheth’s head they took and buried in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.
2 Samuel 5:1 All the tribes of Israel gathered with David in Hebron, and they said: "Look, we are your own kin—your bone and your flesh."
2 Samuel 5:2 Even before now, and for some time past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel into battle and brought them back safely. And the Lord Himself spoke to you, saying: "You will shepherd My people, Israel, and you will be a leader over Israel."
2 Samuel 5:3 Then all the elders of Israel also came to King David in Hebron. And King David made a covenant with them in Hebron, in the presence of the Lord. And they anointed David as king over all Israel.
2 Samuel 5:4 David was forty years old when he began his reign, and he reigned for forty years in total.
2 Samuel 5:5 In Hebron, David reigned over Judah alone for seven years and six months. Then in Jerusalem, he reigned for thirty-three years over both all of Israel and Judah.
2 Samuel 5:6 Then the king and all the men who were with him went to Jerusalem, where the Jebusites lived. And the Jebusites said to David: "You will not enter here unless you defeat even the blind and the lame." They were taunting David by saying: "David will not be able to enter here!"
2 Samuel 5:7 But David captured the stronghold of Zion. This stronghold later became known as the City of David.
2 Samuel 5:8 For David had said on that day: "Whoever is able to strike down the Jebusites, let him go up through the water shaft to reach these lame and blind ones who so hate David's soul." Because of this, it is said in a proverb: "The blind and the lame will not enter the house of the Lord." The Jebusites' taunt came back to bite them.
2 Samuel 5:9 So David lived in the stronghold and called it the City of David. And David built up the city around it, from the Millo—a defensive structure—inward.
2 Samuel 5:10 And David continued to prosper and grew ever more powerful, because the Lord, the God of all creation and armies, was with him.
2 Samuel 5:11 Hiram, the king of Tyre, also sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber, and carpenters and stonemasons. And they built a royal palace for David.
2 Samuel 5:12 And David knew with certainty that the Lord had firmly established him as king over all Israel, and that He had greatly exalted David's kingdom over His own people, Israel.
2 Samuel 5:13 After David had come from Hebron to Jerusalem, he also took more wives and concubines from Jerusalem, and sons and daughters were born to him there.
2 Samuel 5:14 And these are the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
2 Samuel 5:15 Also Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, and Japhia,
2 Samuel 5:16 And Elishama, Elioda, and Eliphalet.
2 Samuel 5:17 Now the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek out David for battle. When David heard this, he went down to a secure defensive position.
2 Samuel 5:18 But the Philistines came and spread out through the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel 5:19 And David consulted the Lord, saying: "Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You give them into my hand?" And the Lord answered David: "Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand."
2 Samuel 5:20 So David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck down the Philistines there. Then David said: "The Lord has broken through my enemies before me, just as a powerful flood breaks through a barrier." Therefore, the name of that place was called Baal Perazim, meaning "Lord of Breakings Through."
2 Samuel 5:21 And the Philistines abandoned their idols there, which David and his men then carried away.
2 Samuel 5:22 But the Philistines came up again, and once more they spread out through the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel 5:23 And David consulted the Lord again, who answered: "You shall not attack them directly. Instead, circle around behind them, and come at them from the direction of the mulberry trees."
2 Samuel 5:24 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that will be your signal to launch the attack. For then the Lord Himself will go out before you to strike down the camp of the Philistines.
2 Samuel 5:25 So David did exactly as the Lord had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines, driving them from Geba all the way to Gezer.
2 Samuel 5:1 So all the leaders and representatives from the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron, saying to him, 'Look, we are your own flesh and blood, your very kin.'
2 Samuel 5:2 Even before this, when Saul was still king over us, you were the one who led the people of Israel in and out of battle. And the Lord God himself said to you: 'You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be their true leader.'
2 Samuel 5:3 Therefore, all the elders of Israel also came to King David in Hebron. And David made a solemn covenant with them there in Hebron, in the very presence of the Lord God. Then they publicly anointed David as king over all Israel.
2 Samuel 5:4 David was thirty years old when he began his reign as king, and he reigned for a total of forty years.
2 Samuel 5:5 In Hebron, he reigned over the tribe of Judah for seven years and six months. Afterwards, in Jerusalem, he reigned over all of both Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.
2 Samuel 5:6 Then the king and all the men who were with him went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites who inhabited that land. The Jebusites defiantly said to David, 'You will not enter this place! Even the blind and the lame can drive you out,' mockingly asserting, 'David will never enter here!'
2 Samuel 5:7 Nevertheless, David successfully captured the stronghold of Zion. This place became known as the City of David.
2 Samuel 5:8 For David had declared on that day: 'Whoever strikes down a Jebusite must ascend through the water shaft and attack these blind and lame ones who are so hated by David's soul.' This is why it is said in a proverb: 'The blind and the lame will not enter the holy place.'
2 Samuel 5:9 So David took up residence in the stronghold, and he named it the City of David. Then David built walls and fortifications all around the city, from the Millo inward.
2 Samuel 5:10 And David continued to prosper, growing in power and becoming highly esteemed, because the Lord God of hosts—the God of armies—was with him.
2 Samuel 5:11 Hiram, the king of Tyre, also sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber, carpenters, and stonemasons. And these skilled craftsmen built a royal palace for David.
2 Samuel 5:12 And David understood that the Lord God had firmly established him as king over all Israel, and that He had greatly exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
2 Samuel 5:13 After he came from Hebron, David also took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem. And more sons and daughters were born to him there.
2 Samuel 5:14 These are the names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon.
2 Samuel 5:15 Ibhar, Elishua, and Nepheg.
2 Samuel 5:16 Japhia, Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphalet.
2 Samuel 5:17 Now the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, and all the Philistines came up to seek him out and fight. When David heard this, he went down to his stronghold—a secure place.
2 Samuel 5:18 Meanwhile, the Philistines had come and spread themselves out in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel 5:19 And David consulted the Lord God, saying, 'Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You hand them over into my power?' The Lord God said to David, 'Go up, for I will surely hand the Philistines over into your power.'
2 Samuel 5:20 So David came to Baal Perazim. There David struck them down and said, 'The Lord God has broken through my enemies before me, just as waters burst forth and divide!' Therefore, the name of that place was called Baal Perazim, meaning 'Lord of Breakthroughs'.
2 Samuel 5:21 And there the Philistines abandoned their idols. David and his men then carried these idols away.
2 Samuel 5:22 But the Philistines came up again and spread themselves out once more in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel 5:23 And David again consulted the Lord God. He responded, 'Do not go up directly against them. Instead, circle around behind them, and attack them from the front of the balsam trees.'
2 Samuel 5:24 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you must rush forward, for at that very moment, the Lord God will go out before you to strike down the Philistine army.
2 Samuel 5:25 So David did just as the Lord God had commanded him. He struck down the Philistines all the way from Geba to Gezer.

2 Samuel 6:1 So King David gathered together again all the chosen warriors of Israel, thirty thousand of them.
2 Samuel 6:2 David himself went up, and all the people with him, from among the men of Judah, to bring the Ark of God back. This Ark is where the very Name of the Lord of all Creation is called upon, the Lord who is enthroned above the Cherubim.
2 Samuel 6:3 They placed the Ark of God upon a new wagon, and they brought it out from the house of Abinadab, which was located on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab's sons, were driving this new wagon.
2 Samuel 6:4 As they carried it from Abinadab's house—Abinadab being the man who lived on the hill—Ahio walked ahead of the Ark.
2 Samuel 6:5 Meanwhile, King David and all Israel were joyfully celebrating before the Lord with all kinds of musical instruments made of fir wood: with harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.
2 Samuel 6:6 But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nachon, Uzzah reached out his hand to the Ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen stumbled and had nearly overturned it.
2 Samuel 6:7 And the Lord became angry with Uzzah, and He struck him down there for his rash irreverence. So Uzzah died there beside the Ark of God.
2 Samuel 6:8 David was saddened because the Lord had struck Uzzah in this way. And he named that place 'The Striking of Uzzah,' a name it holds even to this present day.
2 Samuel 6:9 David then greatly feared the Lord on that day, saying: "How can the Ark of the Lord possibly come to me now?"
2 Samuel 6:10 And David decided not to bring the Ark of the Lord into the City of David for himself. Instead, he diverted it to the house of Obed-Edom, the Gittite.
2 Samuel 6:11 So the Ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-Edom, the Gittite, for three months. And the Lord blessed Obed-Edom and his entire household.
2 Samuel 6:12 It was reported to King David, with people saying: "The Lord has blessed Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him because of the Ark of God." So David went, and he brought the Ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the City of David with great joy.
2 Samuel 6:13 And when those who were carrying the Ark of the Lord had taken six steps, they sacrificed an ox and a ram as offerings to God.
2 Samuel 6:14 And David was dancing with all his might before the Lord. King David was dressed only in a linen ephod, a priestly garment.
2 Samuel 6:15 So David and all the house of Israel brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord into Jerusalem with joyful shouting and the blast of the trumpet.
2 Samuel 6:16 And when the Ark of the Lord entered the City of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out through a window. She saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, and she despised him in her heart for his undignified behavior.
2 Samuel 6:17 They brought the Ark of the Lord inside and placed it in its designated spot, in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.
2 Samuel 6:18 When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the Name of the Lord of all Creation.
2 Samuel 6:19 Then he distributed to all the multitude of Israel, to both men and women, a loaf of bread, a portion of roasted meat, and a cake fried in oil to each person. And all the people departed, each to their own home.
2 Samuel 6:20 Then David returned to bless his own household. And Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to meet David and said: "How glorious the King of Israel made himself today! He exposed himself before the servant girls of his own servants, uncovering himself just as a vulgar fellow might shamelessly uncover himself!"
2 Samuel 6:21 And David said to Michal: "I was dancing before the Lord—the One who chose me rather than your father and rather than his entire house, and who commanded me to be a leader over the Lord's people in Israel. I will continue to celebrate and humble myself before the Lord!"
2 Samuel 6:22 I will even humble myself more than I did today, and I will be lowly in my own estimation. Yet, I will be held in honor by these very servant girls about whom you have spoken so scornfully.
2 Samuel 6:23 Therefore, Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child until the day of her death.
2 Samuel 6:1 David gathered again all the chosen men from Israel—30,000 men in total.
2 Samuel 6:2 And David arose and went with all the people who were with him, from the men of Judah, to bring up the Ark of God from that place. The Ark of God is the sacred object upon which the Most Holy Name of the Lord of armies is invoked, who is enthroned above the Cherubim on it.
2 Samuel 6:3 And they placed the Ark of God upon a new cart. Then they took it from the house of Abinadab, which was in Gibeah. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
2 Samuel 6:4 And when they had taken it from the house of Abinadab, which was in Gibeah, Ahio walked in front of the Ark.
2 Samuel 6:5 But David and all of Israel were celebrating before the Lord with all sorts of instruments made of wood: harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.
2 Samuel 6:6 After they reached Nachon's threshing floor, the oxen stumbled and turned aside. So Uzzah stretched out his hand to the Ark of God and took hold of it to steady it.
2 Samuel 6:7 And the Lord was angry against Uzzah, and struck him for his rashness—touching the sacred Ark was forbidden—and he died there beside the Ark of God.
2 Samuel 6:8 And David was saddened because the Lord had struck Uzzah, and the name of that place has been called The Striking of Uzzah until the present day.
2 Samuel 6:9 And David was filled with reverential fear for the Lord that day, saying, 'How shall the Ark of the Lord come to me?'
2 Samuel 6:10 And he did not want to bring the Ark of the Lord to himself into the City of David, but diverted it to the house of Obededom the Gittite.
2 Samuel 6:11 Therefore, the Ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obededom the Gittite for three months, and the Lord bestowed blessings upon Obededom and all his household.
2 Samuel 6:12 And it was reported to King David, saying to him, 'The Lord has bestowed blessings upon Obededom and all his possessions because of the Ark of God.' So David went up and brought the Ark of the Lord from the house of Obededom into the City of David with joy.
2 Samuel 6:13 And when those who carried the Ark of the Lord had completed a space of six steps, they offered a bull and a ram as sacrifices—a ritual of purification and dedication.
2 Samuel 6:14 And David was dancing with great fervor before the Lord in worship. David was wearing a linen ephod, a priestly garment.
2 Samuel 6:15 And all of Israel was bringing up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with joyful shouts and with the sound of the trumpet.
2 Samuel 6:16 And when the Ark of the Lord came into the City of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out through a window. She saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she scorned him in her heart.
2 Samuel 6:17 And they brought in the Ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.
2 Samuel 6:18 And when he had finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he invoked blessings upon the people in the name of the Lord of armies.
2 Samuel 6:19 And he distributed to the entire multitude of Israel, to both men and women, to each a loaf of bread, a portion of roasted beef, and a fried cake made with oil. Then all the people went, each to his own house.
2 Samuel 6:20 And David returned to bless his household. Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to meet David and said sarcastically, 'How splendid the king of Israel was today! He uncovered himself before the servant girls of his servants, as a common jester might uncover himself!'
2 Samuel 6:21 And David said to Michal, 'I was celebrating before the Lord! It was the Lord who chose me instead of your father and all his house. He commanded me to be a leader over the people of the Lord in Israel. Therefore, I will celebrate and rejoice and humble myself before the Lord.'
2 Samuel 6:22 'And I will humble myself even more than before, and I will be humble in my own eyes. And as for the servant girls about whom you spoke, I will be held in honor by them.'
2 Samuel 6:23 Therefore, Michal, Saul's daughter, had no child until the day of her death.
2 Samuel 7:1 It happened that the king was finally settled in his own home, and the Lord had given him peace and rest from all the enemies surrounding him from every side.
2 Samuel 7:2 He said to Nathan the prophet: 'Do you not see that I, David, live in a magnificent palace built with cedar wood, while the Ark of God still resides within mere tent fabrics?'
2 Samuel 7:3 Nathan replied to the king, 'Go ahead and do whatever is in your heart, for the Lord God is truly with you.'
2 Samuel 7:4 However, that very night, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:
2 Samuel 7:5 'Go and say to My servant David: “Thus says the Lord God: Is it truly you who will build a house for Me to dwell in?
2 Samuel 7:6 For I have not lived in a permanent house since the day I brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this very day. Instead, I have moved around with them, dwelling in a tabernacle and a tent.
2 Samuel 7:7 Throughout all the places where I have traveled with all the children of Israel, did I ever speak a single word to any of the tribal leaders of Israel—whom I appointed to shepherd My people, Israel—saying, 'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?'
2 Samuel 7:8 Therefore, now, you shall say this to My servant David: 'Thus says the Lord, God of all heavenly powers: I Myself took you from the pastures, where you were following the sheep, to be a prince and leader over My people Israel.
2 Samuel 7:9 And I have been with you in every place you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. I have made your name great, like the names of the most powerful and famous rulers on the earth.
2 Samuel 7:10 I will also provide a secure place for My people Israel and establish them there, so that they will live in their own land and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them again, as they did from the beginning,
2 Samuel 7:11 this will be from the time I appointed judges over My people Israel. Furthermore, I will give you rest from all your enemies. And the Lord reveals to you that He Himself will build you a house — a dynasty, a lasting lineage.
2 Samuel 7:12 When your life's days are complete, and you go to rest with your ancestors in death, I will raise up your offspring after you—one who will come from your own body—and I will firmly establish his kingdom.
2 Samuel 7:13 He, your son, is the one who will build a physical house — a Temple — for My name, a place where My presence and glory will be honored. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom, confirming it forever.
2 Samuel 7:14 I will be a Father to him, and he will be My son. If he commits any iniquity, I will correct him with the rod and punishment fitting for human beings, to bring him back to righteousness.
2 Samuel 7:15 But My mercy and steadfast love will not be taken away from him, unlike what happened with Saul, whom I removed from My presence as king.
2 Samuel 7:16 Your dynastic house and your kingdom will endure before Me eternally, and your royal throne will be firmly established forever and ever.
2 Samuel 7:17 According to all these words and this entire vision, Nathan then spoke to David.
2 Samuel 7:18 Then King David went into the Lord’s presence, sat down before Him, and said, 'Who am I, Lord God, and what is my household, that You have brought me to such a high and honorable position?'
2 Samuel 7:19 Yet even this, Lord God, seemed too little in Your sight, for You have also spoken about the future of Your servant’s house for generations to come. This is indeed the profound and lasting destiny You have decreed for mankind, O Lord God.
2 Samuel 7:20 What more can David say to You, Lord God, in addition to this? For You, Lord God, know Your servant intimately.
2 Samuel 7:21 It is because of Your word and according to Your own heart’s desire that You have done all these magnificent things, and have made them known to Your servant.
2 Samuel 7:22 For this reason, You are truly great, O Lord God! There is no one like You, and there is no God apart from You, according to all that we have heard with our own ears throughout history.
2 Samuel 7:23 And what other nation on earth is like Your people Israel, whom You went out to redeem for Yourself as Your own special people, to make a glorious name for Yourself? You performed magnificent and awe-inspiring deeds for them on the earth, by redeeming Your own people out of Egypt, demonstrating Your power before other nations who witnessed it.
2 Samuel 7:24 For You have established Your people Israel for Yourself as a people to endure eternally, and You, Lord God, have truly become their God.
2 Samuel 7:25 Now, therefore, Lord God, confirm the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his dynastic house, and make it stand firm eternally; indeed, do as You have spoken.
2 Samuel 7:26 So that Your name may be magnified eternally, and people will say, 'The Lord, God of all heavenly powers, is truly God over Israel!' And may the dynastic house of Your servant David remain stable and enduring before You.
2 Samuel 7:27 For You, Lord God of all heavenly powers, God of Israel, have revealed to Your servant’s hearing, saying, 'I Myself will build you a dynastic house.' Because of this assurance, Your servant has found the confidence in his heart to pray this prayer to You.
2 Samuel 7:28 And now, Lord God, You are God indeed, and Your words are true and faithful. You Yourself have spoken these good promises to Your servant.
2 Samuel 7:29 Therefore, now begin and bless the dynastic house of Your servant, so that it may continue eternally before You. For You, Lord God, have spoken it, and with Your blessing, the dynastic house of Your servant will indeed be blessed forever and ever.
2 Samuel 7:1 It happened when King David had settled in his own house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies, those who were his adversaries—
2 Samuel 7:2 he said to Nathan the prophet: “You see that I live in a house built of cedar wood, but the Ark of God is placed only in the midst of curtains—meaning, a tent.”
2 Samuel 7:3 And Nathan said to the king: “Everything that is in your heart to do, go and do it, because the Lord is with you.”
2 Samuel 7:4 However, on that very night, behold, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:
2 Samuel 7:5 “Go, and speak to my servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord: Is it you who will build me a house to dwell in?’
2 Samuel 7:6 For I have not dwelt in a fixed house from the day I brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this very day: instead, I have walked about in a tabernacle, and in a tent.
2 Samuel 7:7 Through all the places I have passed with all the children of Israel, did I ever speak to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying: ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’
2 Samuel 7:8 And now, you shall say these things to my servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord of armies: I took you from the pastures, following the flocks, so that you would be a leader over my people Israel:
2 Samuel 7:9 and I have been with you in everything, wherever you have walked, and I have cut off all your enemies from before your face. And I have made for you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.
2 Samuel 7:10 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them there, and they will dwell under it, and they will no longer be disturbed. Nor will the children of iniquity continue to afflict them, as from the beginning—
2 Samuel 7:11 from the day I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Furthermore, the Lord declares to you that the Lord himself will make a house—a dynasty—for you.
2 Samuel 7:12 And when your days are completed, and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who will come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
2 Samuel 7:13 He himself will build a house—the Temple—for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
2 Samuel 7:14 I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to me. If he does anything wickedly, I will correct him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men.
2 Samuel 7:15 But my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I took away from before my face.
2 Samuel 7:16 And your house will be faithful, and your kingdom will endure forever before you, and your throne will be firm perpetually—this promise is fulfilled in your descendant, Christ the Lord.
2 Samuel 7:17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, thus Nathan spoke to David.
2 Samuel 7:18 Then King David entered and sat before the Lord, and said: “Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me to such a greatness?
2 Samuel 7:19 But even this is small in your sight, O Lord God, unless you have also spoken concerning the house of your servant for a long time to come—into eternity. For this is the law of Adam, O Lord God—a universal and enduring decree for humanity.
2 Samuel 7:20 What more then can David add, that he should speak to you? For you know your servant, O Lord God.
2 Samuel 7:21 Because of your word, and according to your own heart, you have done all these great things, so that you might make them known to your servant.
2 Samuel 7:22 Therefore you are magnified, O Lord God, because there is no one like you, nor is there any God besides you, in all that we have heard with our own ears.
2 Samuel 7:23 And what other nation on earth is like your people Israel, whom you went to redeem for yourself as a people, and to establish for yourself a name, and to do for them great and terrible things on the earth, from before the nations you redeemed for yourself out of Egypt?
2 Samuel 7:24 And you have established for yourself your people Israel as an eternal people, and you, O Lord God, have become their God.
2 Samuel 7:25 Now therefore, O Lord God, the word which you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, raise it up forever, and do as you have spoken.
2 Samuel 7:26 So that your name may be magnified forever, with people saying: 'The Lord of armies is God over Israel.' And the house of your servant David will be stable before you.
2 Samuel 7:27 Because you, O Lord of armies, God of Israel, have revealed in the ear of your servant, saying: ‘I will build a house—a dynasty—for you,’ therefore your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to you.
2 Samuel 7:28 Now therefore, O Lord God, you are God, and your words will be true. You have spoken these good things to your servant.
2 Samuel 7:29 Begin therefore, and bless the house of your servant, that it may be forever before you. Because you, O Lord God, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever.
2 Samuel 8:1 After these events, David waged war against the Philistines, defeating them and humbling their power. David seized control over their chief city, making them subject to his rule and compelling them to pay tribute.
2 Samuel 8:1 After these events, David attacked the Philistines and utterly subdued them. David then took what the Latin calls 'the bridle of tribute' from Gath, meaning he seized control of this principal Philistine city and its surrounding territories, forcing them into submission and tribute.
2 Samuel 8:2 David also attacked the Moabites, subjecting them to a severe judgment. He measured them out with a rope, as if laying them flat on the ground for execution. He put two-thirds of them to death, sparing only one-third. Thus, Moab became servants of David, compelled to pay him tribute.
2 Samuel 8:3 David also struck Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, who was the king of Zobah. This happened when Hadadezer was on an expedition to extend his dominion all the way to the Euphrates River.
2 Samuel 8:4 David captured a vast military force from Hadadezer: seventeen hundred horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers. As a tactical move to prevent their future use in warfare against him, David then crippled all the horses intended for chariots by cutting their leg tendons, except for those needed for one hundred chariots, which he kept.
2 Samuel 8:5 The Syrians from Damascus also came to help Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. But David defeated them too, striking down twenty-two thousand Syrian soldiers.
2 Samuel 8:6 David then established garrisons throughout the region of Damascus in Syria. As a result, Syria became subject to David, obligated to pay him tribute. The Lord God assisted David in every endeavor he undertook.
2 Samuel 8:7 David also took the golden shields that belonged to Hadadezer’s royal officers, and he brought these valuable spoils of war back to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 8:8 From Betah and Beroth, which were cities belonging to Hadadezer, King David seized a vast quantity of bronze.
2 Samuel 8:9 Then Tou, the king of Hamath, heard the news that David had defeated Hadadezer’s entire army.
2 Samuel 8:10 King Tou then sent his son, Joram, to King David. Joram’s mission was to offer a formal greeting, to congratulate David on his victory, and to express gratitude because David had fought against and defeated Hadadezer. This was a significant act, as King Tou was an enemy of Hadadezer. Joram also brought gifts of silver, gold, and bronze vessels for David.
2 Samuel 8:11 King David consecrated these gifts, along with all the silver and gold he had dedicated from all the nations he had subdued, to the Lord. This act of sanctification meant they were set aside for sacred use in the service of God.
2 Samuel 8:12 These consecrated offerings came from the spoils taken from Syria, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and the Amalekites. They also included the spoils from Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
2 Samuel 8:13 David also gained great renown for himself when he returned from defeating twelve thousand enemies in the Valley of Salt. Although the Latin text says 'Syria,' this victory most likely refers to his conquest of Edom in that southern region, a battle where he struck down twelve thousand.
2 Samuel 8:14 David then established garrisons throughout Idumea, also known as Edom, and as a result, the entire region of Idumea became completely subject to David. And, as before, the Lord God assisted David in every endeavor he undertook.
2 Samuel 8:15 So David reigned as king over all of Israel, and he administered fair judgment and righteousness to all of his people.
2 Samuel 8:16 Now, Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was the commander of David’s army. And Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, served as the royal chronicler, responsible for keeping all official records.
2 Samuel 8:17 Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, served as the principal priests. Seraiah was the royal secretary, handling official correspondence and state affairs.
2 Samuel 8:18 Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in command of the Cherethites and Pelethites, who were David’s personal elite guard. And David’s sons themselves held high office as royal ministers, called 'priests' in this context, indicating their sacred and prominent role in the kingdom.
2 Samuel 9:1 Now David said, "Is there anyone left from the royal house of Saul, so that I may show kindness to him—fulfilling my covenant with Jonathan?"
2 Samuel 9:2 Now there was a servant from Saul's household, named Ziba. When the king called him, David asked, "Are you Ziba?" And he replied, "I am your servant."
2 Samuel 9:3 And the king asked, "Is there still anyone left from the house of Saul, that I may show him the kindness of God's covenant?" Ziba then said to the king, "Yes, there is still a son of Jonathan alive, but he is lame in both his feet."
2 Samuel 9:4 David then asked, "Where is he?" And Ziba replied, "Behold, he is in the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar."
2 Samuel 9:5 So King David sent messengers, and they brought him from the house of Machir, son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
2 Samuel 9:6 When Mephibosheth (also known as Meribbaal), the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, came to David, he fell on his face and paid homage. And David said, "Mephibosheth?" He replied, "Behold, I am your servant."
2 Samuel 9:7 And David said to him, "Do not fear, for I will most certainly show you great kindness for the sake of Jonathan, your father. I will restore to you all the fields that belonged to Saul, your grandfather, and you shall always eat bread at my royal table."
2 Samuel 9:8 He prostrated himself again and said, "What is your servant, that you would show regard for a dead dog such as I am?"
2 Samuel 9:9 Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "Everything that belonged to Saul and his entire household, I have now given to your master's son—Mephibosheth."
2 Samuel 9:10 "Therefore, you and your sons and your servants are to work the land for him. You shall bring in the produce so that your master's son may have food to eat and be provided for. Mephibosheth, your master's son, will always eat at my royal table." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
2 Samuel 9:11 Ziba said to the king, "Just as my lord the king has commanded, so your servant will do. Mephibosheth will eat at your table as one of the king's own sons."
2 Samuel 9:12 Now Mephibosheth had a young son named Micah. And all the household of Ziba became servants to Mephibosheth.
2 Samuel 9:13 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king's table; and he was lame in both feet.
2 Samuel 10:1 It happened after these events that the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun began to reign in his place.
2 Samuel 10:2 And David said, 'I will show kindness to Hanun, the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.' So David sent messengers to console him over the death of his father. When David’s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites,
2 Samuel 10:3 the princes of Ammon spoke to their lord Hanun: 'Do you really believe David has sent these comforters to you out of honor for your father? Is it not rather to spy out our city, to investigate its defenses, and to overthrow it?'
2 Samuel 10:4 So Hanun seized David’s servants, shaved off half of their beards, cut their outer garments off at the middle—up to their buttocks—and then sent them away in disgrace.
2 Samuel 10:5 When this news was reported to David, he sent people to meet them, because the men were greatly humiliated. And David commanded them, saying: 'Remain in Jericho until your beards have grown out, and then you may return.'
2 Samuel 10:6 But when the sons of Ammon realized what they had done to David and that they had made themselves utterly detestable to him, they sent and hired twenty thousand foot soldiers from Aram-Rehob and Aram-Zobah, one thousand men from the king of Maacah, and twelve thousand men from Ish-Tob.
2 Samuel 10:7 When David heard this, he sent Joab and his entire army, which was made up of his most powerful warriors.
2 Samuel 10:8 So the sons of Ammon came out and drew up their battle line at the entrance of the city gate. Meanwhile, the men of Aram-Rehob, Ish-Tob, Maacah, and Zobah were arrayed separately in the open field.
2 Samuel 10:9 When Joab saw that the battle lines were set against him both in front and behind, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them for battle against the Arameans.
2 Samuel 10:10 He gave the rest of the army to his brother Abishai, who arrayed them in a battle line against the sons of Ammon.
2 Samuel 10:11 And Joab said to Abishai: 'If the Arameans prove too strong for me, then you must come to my aid. But if the sons of Ammon prove too strong for you, then I will come to your aid.'
2 Samuel 10:12 'Be strong! Let us act courageously for our people and for the cities of our God. May the Lord do what is good in His sight.'
2 Samuel 10:13 So Joab and the people with him advanced into battle against the Arameans, who immediately fled from his presence.
2 Samuel 10:14 When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled from the presence of Abishai and retreated into their city. Then Joab returned from fighting the sons of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 10:15 When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated before Israel, they gathered themselves together for a fresh assault.
2 Samuel 10:16 Hadadezer then sent for help and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River, and he brought with them Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army, to lead them.
2 Samuel 10:17 When this was reported to David, he gathered all of Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Helam. The Arameans arrayed their battle lines against David and fought against him.
2 Samuel 10:18 The Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred charioteers and forty thousand horsemen from among them. He also struck down Shobach, the commander of their army, who immediately died there.
2 Samuel 10:19 When all the kings who were allies of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their servants. After this, the Arameans were afraid to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
2 Samuel 10:1 Now it came to pass after these events, that the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanon began to reign in his place.
2 Samuel 10:2 And David said: 'I will show kindness to Hanon, the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.' So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. But when David’s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites,
2 Samuel 10:3 the counselors of the Ammonites said to Hanon, their lord: 'Do you truly believe that David sent men to comfort you out of honor for your father? Or did he send them to spy out, to thoroughly search, and to overthrow our city?'
2 Samuel 10:4 So Hanon took David's servants. He shaved off half of their beards and cut their garments in the middle, down to their buttocks, and then sent them away, inflicting deep shame upon them.
2 Samuel 10:5 And when this humiliating event was reported to David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. He commanded them, saying: 'Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.'
2 Samuel 10:6 Therefore, the Ammonites, realizing they had become utterly contemptible in David's eyes after their insult, sent and hired twenty thousand foot soldiers from Aram-Rehob and Aram-Zobah. They also hired a thousand men from the king of Maacah and twelve thousand men from Istob.
2 Samuel 10:7 When David heard this, he sent Joab and the entire army of his most valiant men.
2 Samuel 10:8 So the Ammonites went out and drew up their battle line at the entrance of their city gate. Meanwhile, the Arameans from Zobah, Rehob, Istob, and Maacah were positioned separately in the open field.
2 Samuel 10:9 Therefore, Joab, seeing that the enemy battle lines were set against him both in front and in the rear, chose from among all of Israel's most valiant men and drew up his own battle line against the Arameans.
2 Samuel 10:10 The remaining part of the people, he gave to his brother Abishai, who then drew up their battle line against the Ammonites.
2 Samuel 10:11 And Joab said: 'If the Arameans prove stronger than I, you shall come to my aid. But if the Ammonites prove stronger than you, then I will come to your aid.'
2 Samuel 10:12 'Be strong, and let us act bravely for our people and for the cities of our God. May the Lord do what is good in His own sight.'
2 Samuel 10:13 And when the battle began, the Arameans fled before Joab. And the Ammonites, seeing that the Arameans had fled, also fled from Abishai and entered their city. So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came back to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 10:14 But when the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together in one place.
2 Samuel 10:15 So Hadadezer sent and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River, and he led their army to battle. Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer's army, was over them.
2 Samuel 10:16 And it was reported to David. So he gathered all of Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Helam. There they drew up their battle line against the Arameans and fought against them.
2 Samuel 10:17 And the Arameans fled from before Israel. David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand cavalrymen. He also struck Shobach, their army commander, who immediately died there.
2 Samuel 10:18 And all the kings who were under Hadadezer, seeing that they had been defeated by Israel, made peace with Israel and served them. The Arameans were then afraid to help the Ammonites any further.
2 Samuel 10:19 Now it came to pass after these events, that the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanon began to reign in his place.
2 Samuel 11:1 Now it happened, as the year turned, at the time when kings typically go out to wage war, David sent Joab, along with his servants and all of Israel. They devastated the Ammonites and laid siege to Rabbah. But David himself remained in Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 11:2 And it happened one evening, David rose from his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house. From there, he saw a woman washing herself. She was very beautiful.
2 Samuel 11:3 So David sent messengers and inquired who the woman was. And a messenger said to him, 'Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?'
2 Samuel 11:4 Then David sent messengers and had her brought to him. She came in to him, and he slept with her. She then immediately purified herself from the uncleanness of her menstrual cycle.
2 Samuel 11:5 And she returned to her house, having conceived a child. And she sent word to David, saying, 'I have conceived.'
2 Samuel 11:6 David then sent word to Joab, saying, 'Send Uriah the Hittite to me.' And Joab sent Uriah to David.
2 Samuel 11:7 When Uriah came to David, David asked him how Joab was doing, how the people were doing, and how the war was going.
2 Samuel 11:8 And David said to Uriah, 'Go to your house and wash your feet.' And when Uriah left the king's house, a portion from the king's table followed him, sent as a gift.
2 Samuel 11:9 But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and he did not go into his own house.
2 Samuel 11:10 It was reported to David by those who said, 'Uriah did not go into his house.' Then David said to Uriah, 'Have you not just come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?'
2 Samuel 11:11 And Uriah said to David, 'The Ark of God, along with Israel and Judah, dwell in tents. And my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, remain in the open field. How then could I go into my own house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? By your life, and by the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.'
2 Samuel 11:12 Then David said to Uriah, 'Remain here today, and tomorrow I will send you away.' So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
2 Samuel 11:13 David then called for him and made him eat and drink in his presence, and he made him drunk. But in the evening, Uriah went out and slept on his bed with the servants of his lord, and he did not go down to his own house.
2 Samuel 11:14 So it happened in the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
2 Samuel 11:15 In the letter, he wrote this command: 'Place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle. Then, withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die.'
2 Samuel 11:16 Therefore, when Joab besieged the city, he placed Uriah in a spot where he knew there were very strong enemy fighters.
2 Samuel 11:17 And the men of the city came out and fought against Joab. Some of the people, David's servants, fell, and Uriah the Hittite also died.
2 Samuel 11:18 So Joab sent and reported to David all the words of the battle.
2 Samuel 11:19 And he commanded the messenger, saying: 'When you have finished reporting all the details of the battle to the king,
2 Samuel 11:20 If any of the king's anger is stirred, and he says, 'Why did you approach the wall to fight? Did you not know that many projectiles are usually thrown down from the wall from above?
2 Samuel 11:21 Who struck down Abimelech, the son of Jerubaal? Did not a woman throw a piece of a millstone down on him from the wall and kill him at Thebez? Why did you approach so close to the wall?' Then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'
2 Samuel 11:22 So the messenger went and came to David and reported to him all that Joab had commanded him.
2 Samuel 11:23 And the messenger said to David: 'The men of the city had the upper hand against us and came out against us in the open field. But we pursued them and drove them back all the way to the gate of the city.
2 Samuel 11:24 And archers shot down from the wall upon your servants, and some of the king's servants died. Indeed, your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'
2 Samuel 11:25 And David said to the messenger, 'Say this to Joab: 'Do not let this matter discourage you, for the outcome of war is unpredictable. The sword strikes now one way, now another. Press your warriors against the city to destroy it, and strengthen their resolve.''
2 Samuel 11:26 Now when Uriah's wife heard that Uriah, her husband, was dead, she mourned for her husband.
2 Samuel 11:27 After her period of mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her into his house. She became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord.
2 Samuel 11:1 Now it happened when the new year came—the time when kings typically march out to wage war—that King David sent Joab and his own personal guards with him, along with all the army of Israel. They attacked the Ammonites and laid siege to their city, Rabbah, but King David himself remained behind in Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 11:2 Then one day, as the evening was approaching, King David rose from his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's palace. From there he saw a woman bathing on the roof of her own house. The woman was exceptionally beautiful.
2 Samuel 11:3 So the king sent messengers to inquire who the woman was. And it was reported back to him that she was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.
2 Samuel 11:4 Therefore, King David sent messengers, and they brought her to him. She came in to him and he lay with her. She had just purified herself from her ritual uncleanness, meaning she was fertile. Afterwards, she returned to her house.
2 Samuel 11:5 And the woman conceived a child. She then sent word to King David, saying: 'I have become pregnant.'
2 Samuel 11:6 So King David sent word to Joab, saying: 'Send Uriah the Hittite to me.' And Joab sent Uriah to King David.
2 Samuel 11:7 When Uriah came to King David, David asked him how Joab was, and how the soldiers were, and how the war was progressing.
2 Samuel 11:8 Then King David said to Uriah: 'Go to your house, and wash your feet.' So Uriah departed from the king's house, and the king's servants carried a gift of food after him, as a sign of favor.
2 Samuel 11:9 But Uriah slept outside the gate of the king's house, with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down into his own house.
2 Samuel 11:10 And they reported to King David, saying: 'Uriah did not go down to his house.' King David then said to Uriah: 'Have you not just come from a journey? Why then did you not go down to your house?'
2 Samuel 11:11 Uriah answered King David: 'The Ark of God, and all Israel, and Judah, are living in temporary shelters, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are sleeping in the open field. And should I then go into my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? By your very life, and by the life of your soul, I will not do this thing!'
2 Samuel 11:12 Then King David said to Uriah: 'Stay here also today, and tomorrow I will send you back to the army.' So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.
2 Samuel 11:13 And King David invited him to eat and drink in his presence, and made him drunk. But Uriah still went out in the evening and slept on his pallet with the servants of his lord, and did not go down into his own house.
2 Samuel 11:14 So it happened in the morning, King David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah himself.
2 Samuel 11:15 Now in the letter he wrote, he gave these instructions: 'Place Uriah in the front line, where the battle is fiercest. Then withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die.'
2 Samuel 11:16 So when Joab was besieging the city, he placed Uriah in a spot where he knew there were the strongest, most valiant enemy soldiers.
2 Samuel 11:17 And the men came out from the city and fought against Joab. Some of the soldiers, servants of King David, fell in battle, and Uriah the Hittite also died.
2 Samuel 11:18 Then Joab sent and reported to King David all the details of the battle.
2 Samuel 11:19 And he commanded the messenger, saying: 'When you have finished reporting all the words of the battle to the king—'
2 Samuel 11:20 '—if perhaps the king should become angry and say: Why did you approach the wall to fight? Did you not know that whatever is thrown from the wall above can easily kill? For example—'
2 Samuel 11:21 '—who killed Abimelech, the son of Jerubaal? Was it not a woman who threw a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, and killed him in Thebez? Why did you approach so close to the wall? If he asks this, then you are to say: 'Indeed, your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.''
2 Samuel 11:22 So the messenger went, and came to King David, and reported to him all that Joab had commanded him.
2 Samuel 11:23 And the messenger said to King David: 'The men of the city overpowered us, and came out against us into the open field. And we fought them all the way to the gate of the city.'
2 Samuel 11:24 'And archers shot arrows upon your servants from the wall, and some of the king's servants died, and indeed, your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'
2 Samuel 11:25 And King David said to the messenger: 'Thus you shall say to Joab: 'Do not let this matter discourage you. For the outcome of war is uncertain; sometimes the sword consumes one man, and sometimes another. Intensify the fight against the city, and overthrow it.' And with these words, David sought to encourage Joab.
2 Samuel 11:26 Now when Uriah's wife heard that Uriah, her husband, was dead, she mourned for her husband.
2 Samuel 11:27 And when her period of mourning was over, King David sent for her and brought her to his house, and she became his wife. Then she bore him a son. But the deed that King David had done was displeasing in the sight of the Lord.
2 Samuel 12:1 The Lord then sent the prophet Nathan to King David. When Nathan came to David, he told him a story: 'There were two men in one city; one was very rich, and the other was very poor.'
2 Samuel 12:2 The rich man owned many, many sheep and cattle.
2 Samuel 12:3 But the poor man had nothing at all, except one tiny lamb. He had bought it and raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It would eat from his own plate, drink from his own cup, and sleep in his arms; it was like a daughter to him.
2 Samuel 12:4 When a traveler came to the rich man, he refused to take from his own many sheep and cattle to prepare a meal for his guest, whom he had received as a visitor. Instead, he took the lamb of the poor man and prepared it for the person who had come to him.
2 Samuel 12:5 David became very angry and indignant at the man, and he said to Nathan, 'As the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die! His action is a capital offense.'
2 Samuel 12:6 'He must repay the lamb fourfold because he did such a thing and showed no mercy.'
2 Samuel 12:7 Then Nathan said to David, 'You are that man! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I rescued you from the hand of Saul.'
2 Samuel 12:8 'I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your possession. I also gave you the kingdom of Israel and Judah. If all this were too little, I would have added even more to you.'
2 Samuel 12:9 'Why then have you despised the word of the Lord by doing evil in My sight? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with a sword, and you took his wife to be your own wife, and you killed him by the sword of the Ammonites.'
2 Samuel 12:10 'Therefore, the sword will never depart from your house from this day forward, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own wife.'
2 Samuel 12:11 'This is what the Lord says: 'Behold, I will bring disaster upon you from your own household. I will take your wives and give them to your neighbor before your very eyes, and he will sleep with your wives in the sight of the sun itself, openly and without shame.''
2 Samuel 12:12 'For you acted in secret, but I will do this thing in the sight of all Israel and in the sight of the sun, making your sin publicly known.'
2 Samuel 12:13 And David said to Nathan, 'I have sinned against the Lord.' Nathan then said to David, 'The Lord has also removed your sin; you will not die immediately for it.'
2 Samuel 12:14 'Nevertheless, because by this deed you have given the enemies of the Lord great occasion to blaspheme His name, the child who is born to you will surely die.'
2 Samuel 12:15 Then Nathan returned to his own house. And the Lord struck the child whom Uriah's wife had borne to David, and the child became very ill.
2 Samuel 12:16 David pleaded with the Lord for the child. David fasted by going without food, and he went into his private chamber and lay on the ground all night.
2 Samuel 12:17 So the elders of his household came to him to raise him from the ground, but he refused their help and would not eat any food with them.
2 Samuel 12:18 On the seventh day, the child died. And David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, 'Look, while the child was still alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to our words. How much more will he afflict himself if we tell him that the boy is dead?'
2 Samuel 12:19 But when David noticed his servants whispering among themselves, he understood that the child was dead. So he asked his servants, saying, 'Is the child dead?' And they answered him, 'He is dead.'
2 Samuel 12:20 Then David arose from the ground, washed himself, anointed himself with oil, and changed his clothing. He went into the house of the Lord and worshiped there. Then he returned to his own house and requested food, and he ate.
2 Samuel 12:21 His servants then said to him, 'What is this thing you have done? While the child was still alive, you fasted and wept. But now that the child is dead, you have risen and eaten bread.'
2 Samuel 12:22 He replied, 'While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, because I thought to myself: 'Who knows? Perhaps the Lord will have mercy on me, and the child will live.''
2 Samuel 12:23 'But now that the child is dead, why should I continue to fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him in death, but he will not return to me in life.'
2 Samuel 12:24 And David comforted Bathsheba, his wife. He went in to her and slept with her. She conceived and gave birth to a son, and he named him Solomon. And the Lord loved this child.
2 Samuel 12:25 And the Lord sent a message by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called the child's name Jedidiah (which means 'Beloved of the Lord'), because the Lord loved him.
2 Samuel 12:26 Now Joab was fighting against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and he captured the royal city, which was the capital.
2 Samuel 12:27 And Joab sent messengers to David, saying, 'I have fought against Rabbah and have captured the city's water supply.'
2 Samuel 12:28 'Now, therefore, gather the rest of the people and besiege the city yourself, and capture it. Do this so that when the city is taken, it will not be named after me, but after you.'
2 Samuel 12:29 So David gathered all the people and went against Rabbah. He fought against it and captured it.
2 Samuel 12:30 And David took the crown of their king from his head. Its weight was a talent of gold, and it had precious stones embedded in it. It was then placed upon David's own head. He also carried away a very great amount of plunder from the city.
2 Samuel 12:31 He also brought out the people who were in it and put them to forced labor with saws, with iron picks, and with iron axes. He made them pass through the brick kiln, meaning he subjected them to harsh, enslaving labor, including making bricks. He did this to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all his army returned to Jerusalem.

2 Samuel 13:1 After these events, Absalom, a son of King David, had a very beautiful sister named Tamar. Amnon, another son of King David, then fell deeply in love with her.
2 Samuel 13:2 Amnon became so distressed over his sister Tamar that he fell sick and grew weak. This was because she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to act on his sinful desire for her.
2 Samuel 13:3 Now, Amnon had a friend named Jonadab. Jonadab was the son of Shimeah, who was King David's brother—making him Amnon's cousin. Jonadab was an extremely shrewd and cunning man.
2 Samuel 13:4 Jonadab asked Amnon, 'Why do you look so worn out and thin, O son of the king, day after day? Won't you tell me what's bothering you?' Amnon answered him, 'I am in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of my brother Absalom.'
2 Samuel 13:5 Then Jonadab said to him, 'Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father, King David, comes to visit you, you must say to him: 'Please, let my sister Tamar come and prepare some food for me. Let her make me a special dish so I can eat it from her hand.''
2 Samuel 13:6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. King David came to visit him. Amnon then said to the king, 'Please, let my sister Tamar come and make two little cakes right before my eyes, so I may eat from her hand.'
2 Samuel 13:7 So King David sent word to Tamar at her home, saying, 'Please go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.'
2 Samuel 13:8 Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took flour, mixed it, and prepared it right before his eyes. Then she cooked the little cakes.
2 Samuel 13:9 She took what she had cooked and set it before him, but he refused to eat. Amnon then said, 'Send everyone out from me.' So everyone was put out and left the room.
2 Samuel 13:10 Amnon said to Tamar, 'Bring the food into the inner room so I can eat it from your hand.' Tamar then took the little cakes she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in the inner room.
2 Samuel 13:11 When she offered the food to him so he might eat, he seized her and said, 'Come, my sister, lie with me.'
2 Samuel 13:12 She answered him, 'No, my brother, do not violate me! For such a thing is not allowed in Israel. Do not commit this utterly foolish and wicked act.'
2 Samuel 13:13 For where would I go with my disgrace? And you would be considered like one of the most foolish and wicked men in Israel. Instead, why not speak to the king? He would not deny me to you in marriage, if you asked properly.'
2 Samuel 13:14 But he refused to listen to her pleas. Instead, he overpowered her, disgraced her, and lay with her through force.
2 Samuel 13:15 Then Amnon hated Tamar with an exceedingly great hatred. His hatred for her was greater than the love he had felt for her. And Amnon said to her, 'Get up and leave!'
2 Samuel 13:16 Tamar said to him, 'No! This additional evil of casting me out now is even greater than the evil you have already done to me!' But Amnon refused to listen to her.
2 Samuel 13:17 He called the young man who served him and said, 'Throw this woman out from me and lock the door behind her.'
2 Samuel 13:18 Now, Tamar was wearing a long, full-sleeved tunic, which was the customary garment for royal virgins. So Amnon's servant put her out and locked the door behind her.
2 Samuel 13:19 But Tamar, scattering ashes on her head and tearing the long, full-sleeved tunic she wore, put her hand upon her head and went away, crying out in great distress.
2 Samuel 13:20 Her brother Absalom said to her, 'Was it not your brother Amnon who was with you? Now, then, be silent, my sister. He is your brother. Do not let this matter grieve your heart so much.' So Tamar remained desolate and disgraced in the house of her brother Absalom.
2 Samuel 13:21 Now, King David heard about all these things and became exceedingly angry.
2 Samuel 13:22 However, Absalom did not speak to Amnon, neither for good nor for evil—he did not confront him. For Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel 13:23 It happened after a period of two years that Absalom's sheep were being sheared in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim. Absalom then invited all the king's sons to a feast.
2 Samuel 13:24 Absalom came to the king and said to him, 'Behold, your servant's sheep are being sheared. Please, let the king and his servants come to your servant's feast.'
2 Samuel 13:25 But the king said to Absalom, 'No, my son, please, let us not all come, lest we be a burden to you.' Though Absalom urged him, King David refused to go, but he gave Absalom his blessing.
2 Samuel 13:26 Then Absalom said, 'If you will not come, please let my brother Amnon at least come with us.' The king asked him, 'Why should he go with you?'
2 Samuel 13:27 But Absalom pressed the king with his request, so David sent Amnon and all the rest of the king's sons with him.
2 Samuel 13:28 Now Absalom had given orders to his young men, saying, 'Watch closely when Amnon's heart is cheerful with wine, and when I say to you, 'Strike Amnon and kill him!' Do not be afraid! Have I not commanded you? Be strong and show yourselves to be brave men!'
2 Samuel 13:29 So Absalom's young men did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded them. Then all the other sons of the king rose up, each mounted his mule, and they fled.
2 Samuel 13:30 While they were still on the way, a rumor reached King David, saying, 'Absalom has killed all the king's sons, and not even one of them remains alive!'
2 Samuel 13:31 Then the king arose, tore his royal garments, and fell to the ground. All his servants who stood by him also tore their own garments in sorrow.
2 Samuel 13:32 But Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, spoke up and said, 'Let not my lord the king think that all the young men, the king's sons, have been killed. Only Amnon is dead. For this was planned by Absalom from the day that Amnon violated his sister Tamar.'
2 Samuel 13:33 'Therefore, now let not my lord the king take it to heart, thinking: 'All the king's sons are dead.' For only Amnon is dead.'
2 Samuel 13:34 Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. And the young watchman lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a large company of people were coming by way of the road along the side of the mountain, through the winding paths.
2 Samuel 13:35 Then Jonadab said to the king, 'Behold, the king's sons are coming! It has happened just as I said it would.'
2 Samuel 13:36 As soon as he finished speaking, the king's sons appeared. They raised their voices and wept loudly. And the king also, with all his servants, wept with an exceedingly great lamentation.
2 Samuel 13:37 But Absalom, having fled, went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. So King David mourned for his son Amnon for many days.
2 Samuel 13:38 When Absalom had fled and arrived in Geshur, he remained there for three years.
2 Samuel 13:39 And King David ceased pursuing Absalom, for he had been comforted over Amnon, seeing that he was dead.
2 Samuel 13:40 This verse does not exist in the Clementine Vulgate for 2 Samuel Chapter 13.
2 Samuel 13:1 Now after these events, Absalom, a son of King David, had a very beautiful sister named Tamar. And Amnon, another son of David, fell in love with her.
2 Samuel 13:2 Amnon was so distressed over her that he became sick, wasting away because of Tamar, his sister. For she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible in Amnon's eyes to do anything with her.
2 Samuel 13:3 But Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, the son of Shimeah (David's brother). Jonadab was a very cunning man.
2 Samuel 13:4 Jonadab said to Amnon, 'Why are you so wasted away, son of the king, day after day? Why don't you tell me?' Amnon replied to him, 'I love Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.'
2 Samuel 13:5 Jonadab then said to him, 'Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to visit you, you must say to him: 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food. Let her prepare some warm food in my presence, so I can see it and eat from her hand.'
2 Samuel 13:6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. The king came to visit him. Amnon then said to the king, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and make two small portions of food in my presence, so I may eat from her hand.'
2 Samuel 13:7 So King David sent word to Tamar at her home, saying, 'Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him.'
2 Samuel 13:8 Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took flour, mixed it, and prepared the small portions of food in his sight, cooking them.
2 Samuel 13:9 Then she took what she had cooked and served it to him. But he refused to eat. Amnon said, 'Send everyone away from me!' So all the servants were sent out and left the room.
2 Samuel 13:10 Amnon then said to Tamar, 'Bring the food into the inner room, so I may eat from your hand.' Tamar took the portions she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in the inner room.
2 Samuel 13:11 As she offered it to him, he seized her and said, 'Come, lie down with me, my sister.'
2 Samuel 13:12 She answered him, 'No, my brother, do not do violence to me! For such a thing is not permitted in Israel; do not commit this foolish act.'
2 Samuel 13:13 'And where would I go to hide my disgrace? And you, my brother, would become like one of the foolish men in Israel. Why not speak to the king instead? He would not refuse to give me to you in marriage.'
2 Samuel 13:14 But he refused to listen to her pleas. Instead, overpowering her, he did violence to her and lay with her.
2 Samuel 13:15 Then Amnon hated Tamar with an exceedingly great hatred, so much that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her before. And Amnon said to her, 'Get up and go away!'
2 Samuel 13:16 Tamar said to him, 'No, this evil of sending me away is greater than the other evil you have already done to me.' But he would not listen to her.
2 Samuel 13:17 He called his servant who attended him and said, 'Throw this woman out from my presence and bolt the door behind her!'
2 Samuel 13:18 Now she was wearing a long, sleeved tunic. For such garments were worn by the virgin daughters of kings. So his servant threw her out and bolted the door behind her.
2 Samuel 13:19 Tamar then sprinkled dust on her head, tore her sleeved tunic, put her hand upon her head, and went away, walking and crying out in distress.
2 Samuel 13:20 Her brother Absalom said to her, 'Was your brother Amnon with you? But now, sister, be silent, for he is your brother. Do not let this matter grieve your heart.' So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
2 Samuel 13:21 Now King David heard about all these things and was greatly distressed.
2 Samuel 13:22 However, Absalom did not speak to Amnon, neither good nor evil. For Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.
2 Samuel 13:23 Now after two full years, Absalom's sheep were being sheared in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim. And Absalom invited all the king's sons.
2 Samuel 13:24 Absalom came to the king and said to him, 'Behold, your servant's sheep are being sheared. Please, let the king and his servants come with your servant.'
2 Samuel 13:25 But the king said to Absalom, 'No, my son, please, do not let us all go, lest we be a burden to you.' Though Absalom urged him, David would not go, but he blessed him instead.
2 Samuel 13:26 Absalom said, 'If you will not come, please, let my brother Amnon at least come with us.' The king asked him, 'Why should he go with you?'
2 Samuel 13:27 But Absalom urged him so strongly that David sent Amnon and all the king's other sons with him.
2 Samuel 13:28 Now Absalom had given orders to his young men, saying, 'Watch when Amnon's heart is cheerful from wine. And when I tell you: Strike Amnon and kill him, do not be afraid! Is it not I who command you? Be courageous and be strong men!'
2 Samuel 13:29 So Absalom's young men did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's other sons quickly rose, and each one mounted his mule and fled.
2 Samuel 13:30 While they were still on the way, a rumor reached King David, saying, 'Absalom has struck down all the king's sons! Not even one of them remains!'
2 Samuel 13:31 So the king rose, tore his clothes, and fell to the ground. And all his servants who stood by him also tore their clothes.
2 Samuel 13:32 But Jonadab, the son of Shimeah (David's brother), answered and said, 'Let not my lord the king imagine that all the young men, the king's sons, have been killed. Only Amnon is dead. For this was determined by Absalom from the day that Amnon violated his sister Tamar.'
2 Samuel 13:33 Therefore, let not my lord the king take it to heart now, thinking: 'All the king's sons are dead.' For only Amnon is dead.
2 Samuel 13:34 Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. And the young watchman lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a large crowd of people were coming down the road on the side of the mountain.
2 Samuel 13:35 Jonadab then said to the king, 'Look! The king's sons are coming! What your servant said has happened.'
2 Samuel 13:36 As soon as he finished speaking, the king's sons appeared, and they raised their voices and wept. Even the king and all his servants wept with an exceedingly great lamentation.
2 Samuel 13:37 Absalom, however, fled and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. So David mourned for his son Amnon for many days.
2 Samuel 13:38 Absalom, after he fled and arrived in Geshur, remained there for three years.
2 Samuel 13:39 And King David ceased from pursuing Absalom, because he had become reconciled to Amnon's death.
2 Samuel 13:40 And Amnon died.
2 Samuel 14:1 Therefore, Joab, the son of Zeruiah, knew that King David’s heart was longing for Absalom.
2 Samuel 14:2 So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought a wise woman from there. He said to her: 'Pretend to be in mourning, and put on the clothes of a mourner. Do not anoint yourself with oil, so that you look like a woman who has been mourning a dead person for a long time.'
2 Samuel 14:3 Then go to the king and speak these exact words to him.' And Joab carefully instructed her on everything she was to say.
2 Samuel 14:4 So the woman from Tekoa came to the king, fell before him to the ground, and bowed down, saying, 'Help me, King!'
2 Samuel 14:5 The king asked her, 'What is troubling you?' She answered, 'Alas! I am a widow, and my husband is dead.'
2 Samuel 14:6 'And your handmaid had two sons. They fought against each other in the field, and there was no one to intervene and separate them. One struck the other and killed him.'
2 Samuel 14:7 'And behold, the whole family has risen up against your handmaid, saying: "Hand over the one who struck his brother, so we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir!" They are seeking to extinguish the only remaining spark of my family, so that my husband will have no name or descendants left on the earth.'
2 Samuel 14:8 The king said to the woman, 'Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.'
2 Samuel 14:9 The woman from Tekoa said to the king, 'My lord king, let the guilt be on me and on my father’s house; but may you, O king, and your throne, be free from all blame.'
2 Samuel 14:10 The king said, 'Whoever speaks against you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you again.'
2 Samuel 14:11 She said, 'I beg you, King, remember the Lord your God, so that the avenger of blood may not multiply the killing, and not destroy my son.' The king responded, 'As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground!'
2 Samuel 14:12 Then the woman said, 'May your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.' He said, 'Speak.'
2 Samuel 14:13 The woman then said, 'Why then have you thought of such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this, the king implicates himself as a sinner, since he does not bring back his own banished son.'
2 Samuel 14:14 'We all must die, and we are like water poured out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not desire for a soul to perish, but rather thinks of ways that the banished one may not be utterly cut off.'
2 Samuel 14:15 'Now, therefore, I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, out of fear of the people. And your handmaid thought: "I will speak to the king, perhaps the king will grant his handmaid’s request."'
2 Samuel 14:16 'For the king heard me, and will deliver his handmaid from the power of the man who seeks to banish me, and to completely cut off me and my son from God’s inheritance.'
2 Samuel 14:17 'Your handmaid said: "May the word of my lord the king be like the angel of God, for my lord the king is truly discerning, able to distinguish between good and evil. And may the Lord your God be with you."'
2 Samuel 14:18 The king answered and said to the woman, 'Do not hide from me the word that I am about to ask you.' The woman said, 'Let my lord the king speak.'
2 Samuel 14:19 The king said, 'Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this?' The woman answered and said, 'As your soul lives, my lord king, it is impossible to deviate to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king has said. For you are wise, like an angel of God, to understand all things on the earth.'
2 Samuel 14:20 'Therefore, for this very reason, your servant Joab did this thing: to change the appearance of my speech and plead the case. But you, my lord, are as wise as the wisdom of an angel of God, so you understand all things that happen on earth.'
2 Samuel 14:21 The king then said to Joab, 'Behold, I have granted your request. Go and bring back the young man Absalom.'
2 Samuel 14:22 Joab fell to the ground on his face, bowed down, and blessed the king. Joab said, 'Blessed be the soul of your servant today, because I have found favor in your sight, my lord king, and you have granted your servant’s request.'
2 Samuel 14:23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 14:24 But the king said, 'Let him return to his own house, and not see my face.' So Absalom returned to his own house and did not see the king’s face.
2 Samuel 14:25 Now, Absalom was the most handsome man in all of Israel, and exceedingly beautiful. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, there was no blemish in him.
2 Samuel 14:26 When he cut his hair once a year—because his hair would become very heavy, it would be shorn—the hair from his head weighed two hundred shekels by the royal standard.
2 Samuel 14:27 Three sons were born to Absalom, and one daughter whose name was Tamar, a woman of outstanding beauty.
2 Samuel 14:28 Absalom remained in Jerusalem for two full years and did not see the king’s face.
2 Samuel 14:29 So Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. When Absalom sent a second time, and Joab still refused to come,
2 Samuel 14:30 Absalom said to his servants, 'Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.' So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
2 Samuel 14:31 Then Joab came to Absalom at his house and asked, 'Why did your servants set my field on fire?'
2 Samuel 14:32 Absalom answered Joab, 'I sent word to you, saying: "Come to me, so I can send you to the king, to tell him: 'Why did I even come from Geshur? It would have been better for me to stay there.'" So I beg you, let me see the king’s face. If there is any guilt in me, then kill me.'
2 Samuel 14:33 So Joab came to the king and told him everything. Then Absalom was called, and he entered the king’s presence. He bowed down to the ground before the king, and King David kissed Absalom.
2 Samuel 14:1 So Joab, the son of Zeruiah, knew that King David's heart was yearning for Absalom.
2 Samuel 14:2 Joab sent for a wise woman from Tekoa and brought her to him. And he said to her: 'Pretend to be in mourning. Wear mourning clothes and do not put any oil on your body, so that you appear like a woman who has been mourning a dead person for many days.'
2 Samuel 14:3 Then go to the king and speak these words to him.' Joab put the exact words she was to say into her mouth.
2 Samuel 14:4 So when the woman from Tekoa came to the king, she fell before him on her face, bowed down, and said: 'Help me, my King!'
2 Samuel 14:5 The king said to her: 'What troubles you?' She answered: 'Alas, I am a widow, and my husband is dead.'
2 Samuel 14:6 And your handmaid had two sons. They quarreled with each other in the field, and there was no one to separate them. So one struck the other and killed him.
2 Samuel 14:7 And behold, all the relatives rose up against your handmaid, saying: 'Hand over the one who struck his brother, so we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he murdered, and destroy the heir!' They are threatening to wipe out my only remaining family and prevent my husband's name and descendants from continuing on the earth.
2 Samuel 14:8 The king said to the woman: 'Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.'
2 Samuel 14:9 The woman from Tekoa said to the king: 'My Lord, my King, let the guilt be on me and on my father's house. But let the king and his throne be innocent.'
2 Samuel 14:10 The king said: 'Whoever speaks against you, bring him to me, and he will not trouble you again.'
2 Samuel 14:11 She said: 'May the king remember the Lord his God, so that the avenger of blood does not multiply his vengeance and by no means kill my son.' The king then swore: 'As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son's head shall fall to the ground!'
2 Samuel 14:12 Then the woman said: 'May your handmaid speak a word to my lord, the king.'
2 Samuel 14:13 He said: 'Speak.' And the woman said: 'Why then do you intend such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word, the king condemns himself, because he does not recall his own banished son, Absalom.'
2 Samuel 14:14 We all must die, and we are like water poured out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. God does not take away a soul instantly but rather devises ways for the banished to not perish, that they may be brought back.
2 Samuel 14:15 So now, I have come to speak this word to my lord, the king, fearing that perhaps the people might frighten me. And your handmaid said: 'I will speak to the king, if perhaps the king will grant his handmaid's request.'
2 Samuel 14:16 For the king will surely listen and deliver his handmaid from the hand of any man who would try to disinherit both me and my son from the Lord's inheritance.
2 Samuel 14:17 And your handmaid said: 'May the word of my lord the king bring me peace.' For my lord the king is like an angel of God, discerning good and evil. May the Lord your God be with you.
2 Samuel 14:18 The king answered and said to the woman: 'Do not hide from me the word I am about to ask you.'
2 Samuel 14:19 The woman said: 'Let my lord the king speak.' And the king said: 'Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?'
2 Samuel 14:20 The woman answered and said: 'By the life of your soul, my lord the king, nothing you have said turns to the right or to the left from what your handmaid has uttered. For my lord the king, you are as wise as an angel of God, able to understand all things on earth. Your servant Joab himself commanded me, and he himself put all these words into the mouth of your handmaid.'
2 Samuel 14:21 Therefore, I spoke this word to bring about justice in this matter, for your servant Joab instructed me to do so.
2 Samuel 14:22 And your handmaid spoke to my lord the king, as if to fulfill the purpose of these words. For you, my lord the king, are like an angel of God in your understanding of all things. Therefore, do as you see fit in your wisdom.
2 Samuel 14:23 The king then said to Joab: 'See, I have granted your request. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.'
2 Samuel 14:24 Joab fell on his face to the ground, bowed down, and blessed the king. And Joab said: 'Today your servant understands that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant's request.'
2 Samuel 14:25 So Joab brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 14:26 The king said: 'Let him return to his own house and not see my face.' So Absalom returned to his house and did not see the king's face.
2 Samuel 14:27 Now, three sons and one daughter were born to Absalom. His daughter's name was Tamar, and she was very beautiful.
2 Samuel 14:28 Absalom remained in Jerusalem for two full years and did not see the king's face.
2 Samuel 14:29 So Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. When Absalom sent a second time, Joab still did not come.
2 Samuel 14:30 Then Absalom said to his servants: 'See, Joab's field is next to mine, and it has a barley crop. Go and set it on fire!' So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
2 Samuel 14:31 Then Joab arose and came to Absalom at his house, and said: 'Why did your servants set my field on fire?'
2 Samuel 14:32 Absalom answered Joab: 'I sent to you, saying: 'Come here, so I may send you to the king to ask him: 'Why did I return from Geshur? It would have been better for me to have remained there.'' Therefore, I beg you, let me see the king's face. If there is any guilt in me, then let him put me to death.'
2 Samuel 14:33 So Joab went to the king and told him. And Absalom was called. He entered the king's presence and bowed down on his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.
2 Samuel 15:1 After these events, Absalom began to act like a king. He provided for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
2 Samuel 15:2 Absalom would rise early in the morning and stand at the entrance of the city gate. When anyone had a dispute to bring before the king for judgment, Absalom would call him over and ask, 'From what city are you?' The man would answer, 'Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.'
2 Samuel 15:3 Then Absalom would say to him, 'Your case seems good and just to me, but there is no official appointed by the king to hear your complaint.'
2 Samuel 15:4 Absalom would then add, 'Oh, if only someone would appoint me judge over the land! Then everyone with a dispute could come to me, and I would give them justice.'
2 Samuel 15:5 When anyone approached Absalom to pay him homage, Absalom would extend his hand, take hold of the person, and kiss him.
2 Samuel 15:6 Absalom did this with every Israelite who came to the king for judgment, and he slowly stole the hearts of the people of Israel.
2 Samuel 15:7 After four years of this, Absalom said to King David, 'Let me go to Hebron, so I may fulfill a vow I made to the Lord there.'
2 Samuel 15:8 For your servant made a vow while living in Geshur in Syria, saying: 'If the Lord brings me back to Jerusalem, I will offer a sacrifice to Him.''
2 Samuel 15:9 The king said to him, 'Go in peace.' So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.
2 Samuel 15:10 But Absalom also sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, telling them: 'As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, declare: "Absalom has become king in Hebron!"'
2 Samuel 15:11 Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom. They were invited guests, completely unaware of his true intentions and went with sincere hearts.
2 Samuel 15:12 And Ahithophel the Gilonite, who was David's personal advisor, came from his city of Giloh and joined Absalom. The conspiracy became strong, and the number of people gathering with Absalom continually increased.
2 Samuel 15:13 So a messenger came to David, saying: 'The hearts of all Israel are following Absalom!'
2 Samuel 15:14 David then said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem: 'Get up, let us flee! Otherwise, there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Hurry and leave, so that he doesn't overtake us, bring disaster upon us, and put the city to the sword.'
2 Samuel 15:15 The king's servants said to him: 'Whatever our lord the king commands, your servants are ready to do it willingly.'
2 Samuel 15:16 So the king went out, along with his entire household and all the people who followed him. But the king left behind ten concubine women to guard the palace.
2 Samuel 15:17 The king went out, and all the people of Israel followed on foot. He stopped at a house that was some distance away from the city.
2 Samuel 15:18 All his servants marched past him; and all the Cherethites and Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, marched on foot before the king.
2 Samuel 15:19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite: 'Why are you coming with us? Go back and stay with the new king Absalom, for you are a foreigner and an exile from your own homeland.'
2 Samuel 15:20 You only arrived yesterday, and now should you be forced to wander with us today? I am going wherever I must go. Go back, and take your fellow countrymen with you. May the Lord show you mercy and faithfulness.
2 Samuel 15:21 But Ittai answered the king, saying: 'As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means death or life, there your servant will be!'
2 Samuel 15:22 David said to Ittai: 'Come then, and pass by.' So Ittai the Gittite passed by, with all his men and all the little children who were with him.
2 Samuel 15:23 All the land wept with a loud voice as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people headed toward the road that leads to the desert.
2 Samuel 15:24 And behold, Zadok came, and all the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar also came up, waiting until all the people had finished leaving the city.
2 Samuel 15:25 Then the king said to Zadok: 'Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me back and show me both the ark and His dwelling place.'
2 Samuel 15:26 But if He says, 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let Him do to me whatever seems good in His sight.'
2 Samuel 15:27 The king also said to Zadok the priest: 'Do you understand? Return to the city in peace. And let your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan—your two sons—be with you.'
2 Samuel 15:28 'Look, I will hide in the plains of the desert until a message comes from you to inform me.'
2 Samuel 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.
2 Samuel 15:30 Meanwhile, David went up the slope of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he climbed. His head was covered, and he walked barefoot. All the people who were with him also walked with their heads covered, weeping as they went.
2 Samuel 15:31 Someone informed David, saying: 'Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.' And David said: 'Please, Lord, make the counsel of Ahithophel foolish.'
2 Samuel 15:32 When David reached the top of the mountain, where people worshipped the Lord, suddenly Hushai the Archite met him with his tunic torn and dirt on his head.
2 Samuel 15:33 And David said to him: 'If you come with me, you will be a burden to me.'
2 Samuel 15:34 'But if you return to the city and say to Absalom: "I am your servant, O king! Just as I was your father's servant, so now I will be yours," then you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me.'
2 Samuel 15:35 'You will have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there. Every word you hear from the king's household, you must report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.'
2 Samuel 15:36 'Indeed, they have their two sons with them: Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son. Through them, you can send me every message you hear.'
2 Samuel 15:37 So Hushai, David's loyal friend, went back into the city. Just as Hushai entered, Absalom also entered Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 15:1 After these events, Absalom acquired for himself chariots and horsemen, and also fifty men who would run before him, establishing a royal display.
2 Samuel 15:2 And rising early in the morning, Absalom would stand beside the main entrance of the city gate—the place where legal cases were heard. When a man had a dispute and was on his way to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and ask: "From what city are you?" The man would reply: "I am your servant, from one of the tribes of Israel."
2 Samuel 15:3 Then Absalom would say to him: "Your case is sound and just, but unfortunately, there is no one appointed by the king to properly hear you."
2 Samuel 15:4 And he would add with a sigh: "If only someone would make me judge over the land! Then everyone with a dispute could come to me, and I would certainly give them justice."
2 Samuel 15:5 And if a person would approach to show him deference—by bowing down—Absalom would extend his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him.
2 Samuel 15:6 Absalom acted in this way with every Israelite who came for judgment, and by doing so, he stole the loyalty of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel 15:7 After four years had passed, Absalom said to the king: "Please allow me to go to Hebron, so that I may fulfill the vow I made to the Lord there."
2 Samuel 15:8 He added: "For while your servant was in Geshur in Syria, I made a vow saying: 'If the Lord brings me back to Jerusalem, I will offer a sacrifice to Him.'"
2 Samuel 15:9 And the king said to him: "Go in peace." So Absalom rose and went to Hebron.
2 Samuel 15:10 But Absalom had secretly sent messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel with this instruction: "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, declare: 'Absalom is now king in Hebron!'"
2 Samuel 15:11 Furthermore, two hundred men from Jerusalem, who had been invited by Absalom, went with him, completely unaware of his secret plot.
2 Samuel 15:12 Achitophel the Gilonite, David's trusted advisor, also came from his city of Giloh and joined Absalom. The conspiracy grew strong, and the number of people gathering with Absalom continually increased.
2 Samuel 15:13 So a messenger came to David, reporting: "The hearts of all Israel have turned completely to Absalom."
2 Samuel 15:14 Then David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem: "Get up, let us flee! Otherwise, there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Hurry and leave, lest he quickly overtake us, surround us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."
2 Samuel 15:15 The king's servants responded to him: "Whatever our lord the king commands, we, your faithful servants, are ready to do it all."
2 Samuel 15:16 So the king departed, and his entire household followed on foot. However, the king left behind ten concubines to guard the palace.
2 Samuel 15:17 The king and all the people following in his footsteps went out, and then they stopped at a distant house.
2 Samuel 15:18 All his servants passed by him, along with all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites—his personal guard. All six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath also passed by before the king.
2 Samuel 15:19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite: "Why are you coming with us? Go back and stay with the new king Absalom, for you are a foreigner, and you are an exile from your own land."
2 Samuel 15:20 "You only arrived yesterday, and today you are forced to leave with us? I am going wherever I must go. Return, and take your countrymen with you. May the Lord show you steadfast love and faithfulness."
2 Samuel 15:21 But Ittai replied to the king: "As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be—whether it leads to death or to life—there your servant will be also."
2 Samuel 15:22 David then said to Ittai: "Come, cross over with us." So Ittai the Gittite passed over, with all his men and all the families with him.
2 Samuel 15:23 And all the inhabitants of the land wept with a loud voice as the entire populace passed over. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people headed toward the road leading to the wilderness.
2 Samuel 15:24 And behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark of God, and Abiathar went up and offered sacrifices, until all the people had finished leaving the city.
2 Samuel 15:25 Then the king said to Zadok: "Carry the Ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me back and allow me to see it and His dwelling place again."
2 Samuel 15:26 "But if He says to me: 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let Him do to me whatever seems good in His sight."
2 Samuel 15:27 The king also said to Zadok the priest: "Do you understand? Return to the city in peace. And your son Ahimaaz, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son—your two sons—let them be with you.
2 Samuel 15:28 Look, I will hide myself by the fords in the wilderness, until a message comes from you to inform me of the situation."
2 Samuel 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar carried the Ark of God back to Jerusalem and remained there.
2 Samuel 15:30 Meanwhile, David was ascending the slope of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went. His head was covered, and his feet were bare as a sign of mourning and humiliation. All the people who were with him also ascended with covered heads, weeping.
2 Samuel 15:31 Then it was reported to David: "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom!" And David prayed: "Please, Lord, make Ahithophel's counsel foolish."
2 Samuel 15:32 As David reached the summit of the mountain—the place where the Lord was worshipped—there, Hushai the Archite came to meet him, with his tunic torn and dust sprinkled on his head as a sign of distress.
2 Samuel 15:33 And David said to him: "If you come with me, you will be a burden to me:
2 Samuel 15:34 But if you return to the city and say to Absalom: 'I am your servant, O king; just as I was your father's servant, so now I will be your servant,' then you can thwart Ahithophel's counsel for me."
2 Samuel 15:35 Furthermore, Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, are there with you. Every word you hear from the king's household, you must report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
2 Samuel 15:36 For their two sons are there with them: Zadok's son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar's son Jonathan. Through them, you will send me every message that you hear."
2 Samuel 15:37 So Hushai, David's friend, returned to the city. And Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 16:1 When King David had gone a little way past the summit of the Mount of Olives, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, appeared before him, coming to meet him. Ziba had with him a pair of donkeys, loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred baskets of summer fruits, and a wineskin filled with wine.
2 Samuel 16:2 Then the king asked Ziba, 'What is the purpose of these things you have brought?' Ziba answered, 'The donkeys are for your household servants to ride upon. The bread and summer fruits are for your young men to eat, and the wine is for anyone who grows weary and thirsty in the desert to drink.'
2 Samuel 16:3 The king then asked, 'Where is your master's son, Mephibosheth?' And Ziba answered the king, 'He has remained in Jerusalem, saying, 'Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.'
2 Samuel 16:4 Then the king said to Ziba, 'Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.' Ziba replied, 'I bow low and plead that I may find favor in your sight, my lord, O King.'
2 Samuel 16:5 So King David came to Bahurim. And behold, a man from the kindred of the house of Saul came out from there, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came forward, cursing as he approached.
2 Samuel 16:6 He began throwing stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people, and all the strongest warriors, were walking on his right and on his left side.
2 Samuel 16:7 And this is what Shimei said as he cursed the king: 'Get out! Get out, you man of bloodshed, and you worthless man!'
2 Samuel 16:8 The Lord has brought back upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul, because you seized his kingdom. And the Lord has now given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. And behold, your own evil deeds are pressing down upon you, because you are a man of bloodshed.
2 Samuel 16:9 Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, 'Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over now and cut off his head!'
2 Samuel 16:10 But the king said, 'What business is it of mine or yours, O sons of Zeruiah? Let him curse. For the Lord himself has commanded him to curse David, and who is there who dares to say, 'Why have you done this?'
2 Samuel 16:11 And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, 'Behold, my own son, who came out from my body, seeks my life. How much more so should this Benjaminite be allowed to curse? Let him curse, according to the Lord's command.
2 Samuel 16:12 Perhaps the Lord will look upon my affliction and repay me with good for this cursing I endure today.
2 Samuel 16:13 So David and his companions went on their way. But Shimei walked on the side of the mountain ridge, cursing as he went, and throwing stones at David and scattering dust.
2 Samuel 16:14 And the king and all the people with him arrived, weary, and refreshed themselves there.
2 Samuel 16:15 Meanwhile, Absalom and all the people of Israel with him entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.
2 Samuel 16:16 But when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, he spoke to him, saying, 'Long live the king! Long live the king!'
2 Samuel 16:17 And Absalom said to Hushai, 'Is this how you show loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend David?'
2 Samuel 16:18 Hushai answered Absalom, 'No, that is not the case. But instead, the one whom the Lord has chosen, and this people, and all of Israel, I will be his servant, and I will remain with him.'
2 Samuel 16:19 And furthermore, whose servant am I? Am I not the servant of your father? Just as I served before your father, so I will serve before you.
2 Samuel 16:20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, 'Give your counsel now: what should we do?'
2 Samuel 16:21 And Ahithophel said to Absalom, 'Go in to your father's concubines, whom he left behind to guard the house. For when all Israel hears that you have made yourself utterly detestable to your father, the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.'
2 Samuel 16:22 So Absalom had a tent pitched on the roof of the palace, and he went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
2 Samuel 16:23 Now the counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days was considered as if it were an oracle from the word of God. Such was all the counsel of Ahithophel, both when he was with David and now when he was with Absalom.
2 Samuel 16:1 As King David had gone a little way past the top of the mountain (specifically, the Mount of Olives), Mephibosheth's servant, Ziba, appeared to meet him. Ziba was bringing two saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred bunches of raisins, one hundred summer fruits, and a wineskin full of wine.
2 Samuel 16:2 Then the king asked Ziba, "What are these things for?" Ziba replied, "The donkeys are for the king and his household to ride on. The bread and fruit are for your young men to eat, and the wine is for anyone who grows faint in the wilderness to drink."
2 Samuel 16:3 And the king asked, "Where is your master's son, Mephibosheth?" Ziba answered the king, "He has stayed behind in Jerusalem, saying, 'Today the house of Israel will restore my father's kingdom to me.'"
2 Samuel 16:4 Then the king said to Ziba, "Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." Ziba replied, "I bow down to you, my lord the king; I pray that I may always find favor in your sight."
2 Samuel 16:5 So King David arrived at Bahurim, and behold, a man from the clan of Saul's family, named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out from there. He was walking along and cursing David as he came.
2 Samuel 16:6 And Shimei threw stones at King David and at all of King David's servants. All the people and all the mighty warriors were walking on the king's right and on his left side.
2 Samuel 16:7 This is what Shimei said as he cursed the king: "Get out! Get out, you man of blood, you worthless man!"
2 Samuel 16:8 The Lord has made you pay back for all the bloodshed of Saul's house, because you seized his kingdom. Now the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. Look, your own evil deeds have caught up with you, because you are a man of blood.
2 Samuel 16:9 Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!"
2 Samuel 16:10 But the king said, "What concern is this of yours and mine, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him curse. For the Lord Himself has commanded him to curse David; and who would dare to say, 'Why have you done this?'"
2 Samuel 16:11 And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Look, my own son, who came from my own body, is trying to take my life! How much more, then, should this Benjaminite be allowed to curse? Let him curse, for the Lord has commanded it."
2 Samuel 16:12 Perhaps the Lord will look upon my affliction, and the Lord will repay me with good instead of this cursing I receive today.
2 Samuel 16:13 So David and his companions continued on their way. Shimei kept walking along the side of the mountain ridge opposite them, cursing as he went, and throwing stones at King David, and continuously kicking up dust toward him.
2 Samuel 16:14 Thus the king and all the people with him, being tired, arrived at the Jordan River, and they rested there to refresh themselves.
2 Samuel 16:15 Meanwhile, Absalom and all the people of Israel with him had entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.
2 Samuel 16:16 Now when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, he said to him, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
2 Samuel 16:17 And Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this the loyalty you show your friend? Why did you not go with your friend, King David?"
2 Samuel 16:18 And Hushai answered Absalom, "By no means! Rather, whomever the Lord, and this people, and all of Israel have chosen, I will be with him, and I will remain with him."
2 Samuel 16:19 Furthermore, whom should I serve next? Should it not be his son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you.
2 Samuel 16:20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your counsel; what should we do?"
2 Samuel 16:21 And Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father's concubines, whom he left behind to guard the house. Then all of Israel will hear that you have made yourself detestable to your father, and the resolve of all who are with you will be strengthened." (This act symbolically and literally cut off any reconciliation with David and asserted Absalom's claim to the throne).
2 Samuel 16:22 So Absalom had a tent pitched on the roof of the palace, and he went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
2 Samuel 16:23 Now the counsel that Ahithophel gave in those days was as if one consulted the oracle of God. Such was all of Ahithophel's counsel, both when he was with David and when he was with Absalom. (This highlights Ahithophel's reputation for wisdom and the gravity of his advice).
2 Samuel 17:1 Achitophel then presented his strategy to Absalom: "Let me select twelve thousand men for myself. I will set out this very night and pursue David."
2 Samuel 17:2 "I will attack him while he is weary and exhausted. I will strike him down and scatter all the people who are with him. I will kill only the king."
2 Samuel 17:3 "Then I will bring all of the people back to you, just as a bride returns to her husband. For you are seeking only the life of this one man, and afterward, all the rest of the people will be at peace."
2 Samuel 17:4 This speech pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
2 Samuel 17:5 But Absalom said: "Also call Hushai the Archite, and let us hear what he too has to say."
2 Samuel 17:6 When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him: "This is what Achitophel has proposed. Should we do what he has suggested, or do you advise against it?"
2 Samuel 17:7 Hushai answered Absalom: "Achitophel’s counsel this time is not good."
2 Samuel 17:8 Hushai added: "You know your father and the men with him, that they are mighty warriors and fiercely determined. They are like a bear robbed of her cubs in the wilderness. And your father is a man of war; he will not stay with the main army."
2 Samuel 17:9 "Perhaps he is now hiding in some cave or in one of these secret places. And when he first strikes, everyone who hears of it will say, 'A great slaughter has fallen upon the people following Absalom!'"
2 Samuel 17:10 "And even the bravest, strongest-hearted man will be filled with fear if he hears that those who are with David are broken. Moreover, all Israel knows that your father is a powerful warrior, and all who are with him are mighty."
2 Samuel 17:11 "Instead, this is the counsel I give: Let all Israel gather to you, from Dan even to Beersheba—a multitude like the sand by the sea. And you yourself will lead them in the middle of them all."
2 Samuel 17:12 "Then we will fall upon him wherever he may be found, and we will cover him as the dew falls upon the earth—so that not even one man who is with him will remain alive."
2 Samuel 17:13 "If he has fled into some city, then all of Israel will surround that city. And we will drag it away with ropes until not even one small stone is found remaining there."
2 Samuel 17:14 Absalom and all the men of Israel said: "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Achitophel." For the Lord had commanded that Achitophel's useful counsel be made void, so that the Lord might bring disaster upon Absalom.
2 Samuel 17:15 Hushai then said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests: "This is the counsel Achitophel gave to Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is the counsel I myself gave."
2 Samuel 17:16 "Now therefore, quickly send word and tell David: 'Do not stay this night in the desert of the plain. But without delay, cross over the Jordan, lest perhaps the king and all the people with him be swallowed up.'"
2 Samuel 17:17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting by the Rogel Spring. A female servant went and told them the message. And they then set out to carry the message to King David, for they could not be seen entering the city.
2 Samuel 17:18 However, a young man saw them and reported it to Absalom. But the messengers, hurrying quickly, rushed away and entered the house of a man in Bahurim who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it to hide.
2 Samuel 17:19 The woman then took a covering and spread it over the mouth of the well, as people usually do to dry grain, so that nothing at all was known of their hiding place.
2 Samuel 17:20 When Absalom's servants came to the woman at her house, they asked: "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" And the woman answered them: "They hurried across the stream of water." And after they searched and did not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 17:21 When those pursuers had left, the two men came up out of the well. They went and informed King David, saying: "Get up, and quickly cross the river! For Achitophel has given this kind of counsel against you."
2 Samuel 17:22 So David rose up, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan River before daybreak. Not even one person was left who had not crossed the river.
2 Samuel 17:23 But Achitophel, seeing that his counsel had not been followed, saddled his donkey. He rose and went to his own house and to his own city. After he set his household in order, he hanged himself and died, and he was buried in his father’s tomb.
2 Samuel 17:24 Meanwhile, David arrived at Mahanaim. Absalom, however, crossed the Jordan River, and every man of Israel was with him.
2 Samuel 17:25 Absalom then appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Amasa was the son of a man named Jethra the Israelite, who had gone in to Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, who had been Joab's mother.
2 Samuel 17:26 And Israel, with Absalom, camped in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel 17:27 When David came to Mahanaim, three men arrived to support him: Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim.
2 Samuel 17:28 They brought bedding and rugs and earthenware vessels. They also brought food supplies: wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, and lentils.
2 Samuel 17:29 They also brought honey, butter, sheep, and cheese from cattle for David’s use and for the people who were with him. For they had supposed that the people might become hungry and exhausted in the desert.
2 Samuel 17:1 Achitophel then spoke to Absalom: 'Let me choose twelve thousand men for myself, and I will rise up and pursue David this very night.'
2 Samuel 17:2 'I will rush upon him while he is exhausted and weary, and I will strike him down. All the people who are with him will be scattered in terror, and I will strike the king alone.'
2 Samuel 17:3 'I will bring all the people back to you as a bride returns to her husband. For it is only the life of one man that you seek, and then all the people will be at peace.'
2 Samuel 17:4 This plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
2 Samuel 17:5 Absalom then said: 'Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he too has to say.'
2 Samuel 17:6 When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said, speaking to him: 'Achitophel has spoken in this manner. Should we follow his advice or not? You advise us.'
2 Samuel 17:7 And Hushai said to Absalom: 'The advice that Achitophel has given this time is not good.'
2 Samuel 17:8 Hushai added: 'You know your father and the men who are with him, that they are very mighty and fierce in spirit, like a bear whose cubs have been taken from her in the wild. And your father is a warrior, and he will not spend the night with the people.'
2 Samuel 17:9 'Perhaps right now he is hiding in some pit or in another secret place. And if even one of your men falls at the very beginning of the battle, the people will hear of it and say, 'There has been a great slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!''
2 Samuel 17:10 'Then even the most courageous man, whose heart is like a lion, will be utterly terrified. For all of Israel knows that your father is a mighty warrior, and that all those who are with him are strong.'
2 Samuel 17:11 'Instead, I advise this plan: Let all Israel gather to you, from Dan all the way to Beersheba, as countless as the sand of the sea. And you, personally, with your army, should go into battle at the head of them.'
2 Samuel 17:12 'Then we will come upon him wherever he may be, and we will fall upon him as the dew falls upon the ground. And we will not leave even one of the men who are with him alive.'
2 Samuel 17:13 'But if he has entered into some city, then all of Israel will surround that city, and we will drag all of its stones into the river, until not even one small stone can be found there.'
2 Samuel 17:14 And it came to pass that Absalom and all the men of Israel said: 'The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Achitophel.' But it was by the will of the Lord that Achitophel's useful counsel was defeated, so that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.
2 Samuel 17:15 Hushai then said to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: 'Achitophel gave such and such counsel to Absalom and to the elders of Israel. And I gave such and such counsel.'
2 Samuel 17:16 'Now therefore, quickly send a message and report to David, saying: 'Do not stay this night in the desert plains, but cross over quickly, lest perhaps the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.''
2 Samuel 17:17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were standing by the spring of Rogel. A servant girl would go and report to them, and they would then go and report to King David. For they could not be seen entering the city.
2 Samuel 17:18 However, a certain young man saw them and reported it to Absalom. But Jonathan and Ahimaaz hurried and entered the house of a certain man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and they went down into it.
2 Samuel 17:19 And the woman took a covering and spread it over the mouth of the well, as if she were drying grain on it. And in this way the message was hidden.
2 Samuel 17:20 When Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said: 'Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?' And the woman replied: 'They have crossed the stream of water.' And when they had searched and found them nowhere, they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 17:21 After their departure, Jonathan and Ahimaaz came up out of the well and went and reported to King David, and they said: 'Rise up and cross the waters quickly! For Achitophel has begun to devise such and such counsel against you.'
2 Samuel 17:22 So David arose, and all the people who were with him. And they crossed the Jordan River until dawn. Not even one person remained who had not crossed the Jordan.
2 Samuel 17:23 Now Achitophel, seeing that his counsel had not been followed, saddled his donkey and arose, and went to his house and to his city. And he hanged himself, and so he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.
2 Samuel 17:24 But David came to Mahanaim. Furthermore, Absalom crossed the Jordan River, and all the men of Israel were with him.
2 Samuel 17:25 Absalom indeed appointed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. Amasa was the son of a man named Jether, from Israel, who had gone in to Abigail, the daughter of Nahash, the sister of Zeruiah, who was Joab's mother.
2 Samuel 17:26 And Israel, with Absalom, encamped in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel 17:27 When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash, from Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite, from Rogelim,
2 Samuel 17:28 brought him mattresses, and blankets, and earthenware vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched grain, and beans, and lentils,
2 Samuel 17:29 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cows from the herd. They gave these to David and to the people who were with him, so that they might eat. For they suspected that the people would be hungry, exhausted, and thirsty, having come into the wilderness.
2 Samuel 18:1 David then reviewed his army and appointed commanders and officers over them.
2 Samuel 18:2 David sent one third of the army under the command of Joab. Another third he sent under the command of Abishai, Joab's brother and son of Zeruiah. And the last third he sent under the command of Ittai the Gittite. David said to the whole army, "I will also march out with you."
2 Samuel 18:3 But the army replied, "You must not go out with us! For if we have to flee, the enemy will not care about us. And if half of us fall in battle, they will not care. But you, our king, are like ten thousand of us! It is better for you to stay in the city and help us from there."
2 Samuel 18:4 The king said to them, "Whatever seems best to you, this I will do." So the king stood by the city gate. And the entire army marched out in groups of hundreds and thousands.
2 Samuel 18:5 The king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, "Deal gently, for my sake, with the young man Absalom." And all the people heard the king give this order about Absalom to all the commanders.
2 Samuel 18:6 So the army went out into the open field against the army of Israel. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
2 Samuel 18:7 There, the army of Israel was defeated by David's soldiers. A great slaughter happened that day, with twenty thousand men killed.
2 Samuel 18:8 The battle spread across the entire region, and the dense forest killed more people than the sword.
2 Samuel 18:9 Absalom happened to encounter David's men. Absalom was riding a mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak tree, Absalom's head got caught in the oak. He was left hanging between the sky and the earth, while the mule he was riding continued on its way.
2 Samuel 18:10 A certain man saw this and reported it to Joab, saying, "I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree."
2 Samuel 18:11 Joab said to the man who reported it to him, "If you saw him, why didn't you strike him to the ground? I would have given you ten silver shekels and a military belt."
2 Samuel 18:12 The man replied to Joab, "Even if you had weighed out a thousand silver shekels into my hand, I would not have laid a hand on the king's son. In our hearing, the king commanded you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, 'Guard the young man Absalom, so that no one harms him.'"
2 Samuel 18:13 "If I had done such a treacherous thing against his life, the king would surely have found out, and you yourself would have stood against me."
2 Samuel 18:14 Joab said, "I will not wait like this. I will deal with him myself, right here in front of you." He took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom's heart while he was still struggling and alive.
2 Samuel 18:15 Then ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom. They struck him and finished killing him.
2 Samuel 18:16 Joab then blew the trumpet, signaling an end to the pursuit, and held back the army from chasing the fleeing Israelites. Joab wanted to spare the people.
2 Samuel 18:17 They took Absalom and threw him into a large pit in the forest, and piled a very large heap of stones over him. Then all the remaining soldiers of Israel fled to their tents.
2 Samuel 18:18 Now Absalom, during his lifetime, had erected a monument for himself in the King's Valley. He had said, "I have no son to keep my name alive." So he named the monument after himself, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this very day.
2 Samuel 18:19 Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, then said, "I will run and bring the news to the king that the Lord has avenged him against his enemies."
2 Samuel 18:20 Joab said to him, "You are not the right messenger for this news today. You may deliver a message another day, but today do not carry news, because the king's son is dead."
2 Samuel 18:21 Then Joab said to a Cushite, "Go and tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed to Joab and ran off.
2 Samuel 18:22 Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, still insisted and said to Joab, "But what if I run after the Cushite?" Joab replied, "Why do you want to run, my son? You will not be rewarded for this news."
2 Samuel 18:23 "Regardless," he replied, "I will run!" So Joab said, "Go, run!" Ahimaaz then ran by way of the plain, which was a shortcut, and he overtook the Cushite.
2 Samuel 18:24 Now David was sitting between the two gates of the city. A watchman was positioned on the roof of the gate's tower, and as he looked out, he saw a man running alone.
2 Samuel 18:25 The watchman cried out and informed the king. The king said, "If he is alone, he brings good news." As the runner quickly approached,
2 Samuel 18:26 The watchman saw another man running and called out to the gatekeeper, "Look, another man is running alone!" The king said, "He also brings good news."
2 Samuel 18:27 The watchman said, "I recognize the running style of the first man; it is the stride of Ahimaaz, Zadok's son." The king said, "He is a good man, and he comes with good news."
2 Samuel 18:28 Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well!" He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king!"
2 Samuel 18:29 The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz replied, "I saw a great commotion when Joab sent your servant, the king's servant, and me. But I do not know what it was about."
2 Samuel 18:30 The king said, "Step aside and stand over here." So he stepped aside and stood.
2 Samuel 18:31 Then, the Cushite arrived. The Cushite said, "Let my lord the king hear the news! For the Lord has avenged you today against all who rose up against you!"
2 Samuel 18:32 The king asked the Cushite, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" The Cushite answered, "May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you with evil intent, become like that young man."
2 Samuel 18:33 The king was deeply distressed. He went up to the upper room of the gate and wept. As he walked, he kept saying, "My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!"
2 Samuel 18:1 David then gathered all the men who were with him. He organized them into an army and appointed commanders over thousands of men and captains over hundreds.
2 Samuel 18:2 David then divided his fighting men into three parts. One third was under the command of Joab. Another third was under the command of Abishai, Joab’s brother, the son of Zeruiah. The final third was under the command of Ittai the Gittite. The king then spoke to the men, saying, 'I will also go out to fight with you, personally leading the charge.'
2 Samuel 18:3 The men replied, 'No, you must not go with us. If we were forced to retreat, the enemy would not care much about us. And if half of us were to fall in battle, it would not be of great concern to them. This is because you, our King, are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore, it is far better that you stay within the city and give us support from there.'
2 Samuel 18:4 The king said to them, 'I will do whatever seems best to you.' So the king stood beside the gate of the city. All the men then marched out, organized by their hundreds and by their thousands, ready for battle.
2 Samuel 18:5 The king then gave an order to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. He said, 'For my sake, deal gently with the young man Absalom.' All the fighting men heard the king giving this instruction to all his commanders concerning Absalom.
2 Samuel 18:6 So the men of David went out into the field against the rebel army of Israel. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
2 Samuel 18:7 There, the army of Israel was defeated by David’s servants. On that day, a great slaughter occurred, with twenty thousand men being killed.
2 Samuel 18:8 The battle spread out across the entire face of the land. More men were killed by the forest itself—by its dangers and confusion—than were consumed by the sword in the fighting that day.
2 Samuel 18:9 It happened that Absalom came upon David’s servants while riding a mule. The mule went under a large, low-hanging oak tree, and Absalom’s head became entangled in the branches of the oak. He was left suspended there between the sky and the ground, while the mule he had been riding continued on its way.
2 Samuel 18:10 A certain man saw this occur and reported it to Joab, saying, 'I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.'
2 Samuel 18:11 Joab replied, 'If you saw him, why didn’t you strike him down to the ground right there? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a military belt as a reward.'
2 Samuel 18:12 The man answered Joab, 'Even if you were to weigh out a thousand shekels of silver into my hands, I would not lift my hand against the king’s son. For we all heard the king give you, Abishai, and Ittai this command: ‘Be careful that no one harms the young man Absalom.’'
2 Samuel 18:13 Truly, I would not risk my own life by daring to disregard your orders—and the king would surely find out about this. In that case, you yourself would stand against me for disobeying the king.
2 Samuel 18:14 Joab then said, 'That is not how this will end. I will act in your presence!' He took three spears in his hand and thrust them into Absalom’s heart while Absalom was still alive and hanging in the oak tree.
2 Samuel 18:15 Then ten young men, who were Joab’s armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom. They struck him again and killed him, ensuring his death.
2 Samuel 18:16 Joab then blew the trumpet, signaling an end to the pursuit. He stopped the men from chasing the fleeing Israelites, for Joab wanted to spare the people of Israel from further slaughter.
2 Samuel 18:17 Then David’s men took Absalom and threw his body into a large pit in the forest. They piled a very great heap of stones over him, marking his dishonorable grave. Meanwhile, all the remaining men of Israel who had fought for Absalom fled to their homes and tents.
2 Samuel 18:18 Now, while Absalom was still alive, he had erected a pillar for himself in the King’s Valley. He had said, 'I have no son to keep my name alive, so this pillar will be a monument to my name.' He named the pillar after himself, and it is called to this very day, 'Absalom’s Monument.'
2 Samuel 18:19 Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, 'I will run now and bring news to the king—that the Lord has given him victory over his enemies.'
2 Samuel 18:20 But Joab said to him, 'You will not be the messenger today. You may be a messenger on another day, but I do not want you to be the messenger today, because the king’s son is dead, and the news will bring him great sorrow.'
2 Samuel 18:21 Joab then said to a Cushite man, 'Go, tell the king what you have seen.' The Cushite bowed to Joab and quickly ran off.
2 Samuel 18:22 Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, again urged Joab, saying, 'What prevents me from running after the Cushite man as well?' Joab replied, 'Why would you run, my son? You will not be bringing good news.'
2 Samuel 18:23 Ahimaaz answered, 'Even so, what if I simply run?' And Joab said to him, 'Then run!' So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite man.
2 Samuel 18:24 Now David was sitting between the two inner and outer gates of the city. A lookout man had gone up to the roof of the gate by the wall. When he lifted his eyes and saw a man running alone toward them,
2 Samuel 18:25 he called out and informed the king. The king said, 'If he is alone, then he is bringing good news.' As the man hurried and came closer,
2 Samuel 18:26 the lookout saw another man running. The first lookout called out to the king, saying, 'Look, another man is running alone!' The king replied, 'He, too, is bringing good news.'
2 Samuel 18:27 The lookout then said, 'I recognize the running style of the first man; it is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok.' The king said, 'He is a good man, and he comes bringing good tidings.'
2 Samuel 18:28 Ahimaaz then called out and said to the king, 'All is well, O king!' He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, 'Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my lord the king!'
2 Samuel 18:29 The king asked, 'Is the young man Absalom safe?' Ahimaaz answered, 'I saw a great commotion when Joab, your servant, was sending me, your humble servant. I do not know what else happened beyond that.'
2 Samuel 18:30 The king said, 'Stand aside here.' So Ahimaaz stepped aside and stood still.
2 Samuel 18:31 And behold, the Cushite man arrived. He said, 'Let my lord the king hear the news! For the Lord has today granted you justice by delivering you from the hand of all who rose up against you!'
2 Samuel 18:32 The king asked the Cushite man, 'Is the young man Absalom safe?' The Cushite answered, 'May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you with evil intent, be as that young man is now.'
2 Samuel 18:33 The king was deeply shaken and distressed. He went up to the room above the gate and wept. As he walked, he spoke, saying, 'My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!'
2 Samuel 19:1 It was reported to Joab that the king was weeping, and openly mourning over Absalom.
2 Samuel 19:2 And so, all the joy of the people on that day turned into deep mourning, for everyone heard that the king was heartbroken over his son.
2 Samuel 19:3 The people were unsettled; they entered the city in silence on that day. They were as disquieted as an army that has been defeated, and then flees in shame and confusion.
2 Samuel 19:4 The king kept crying out in a loud voice: “My son Absalom, Absalom my son, my son!”
2 Samuel 19:5 So Joab entered the king’s house, and said to him: “Today, you have made all of your servants ashamed. These are the men who, on this very day, saved your life, and the lives of your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your concubines.
2 Samuel 19:6 You love those who hate you, and you hate those who love you. You have shown today that you have no concern for your commanders or for your servants. I truly know this day that if Absalom were alive, and all of us had died, then it would please you.
2 Samuel 19:7 Now get up, go out, and speak words of comfort to your servants. For I swear to you by the Lord, if you do not go out, not even one man will remain with you tonight. And this will be worse for you than all the evils that have befallen you from your youth until this present day.”
2 Samuel 19:8 So the king rose up, and he sat at the city gate. And it was announced to all the people that the king was sitting at the gate. Then all the people came before the king.
2 Samuel 19:9 Meanwhile, the army of Israel had fled, each man to his own tent, their homes.
2 Samuel 19:10 And all the people were contending in all the tribes of Israel, saying: “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies. He himself rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. And now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.
2 Samuel 19:11 But Absalom, whom we anointed over us as king, is dead in battle. Now then, why are you silent? Why are you not bringing the king back?”
2 Samuel 19:12 But King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, saying: “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying: ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house?
2 Samuel 19:13 You are my brothers, my very own flesh and blood. Why should you be the last to bring the king back?
2 Samuel 19:14 And to Amasa you shall say: ‘Are you not my very own flesh and blood? May God do such to me, and add more to it, if you are not the commander of my army for all days in place of Joab.’ ”
2 Samuel 19:15 And David swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah as if they were one man. So they sent word to the king, saying: “Return, you and all your servants.”
2 Samuel 19:16 So the king returned, and came as far as the Jordan River. And Judah had come to Gilgal to meet the king, so that they might escort him across the Jordan.
2 Samuel 19:17 Then Shimei, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
2 Samuel 19:18 There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him. Also, Ziba, the servant of Saul’s house, and his fifteen sons, and his twenty servants were with him. And they rushed into the Jordan ahead of the king.
2 Samuel 19:19 They crossed the river by ferry boat to carry over the king’s household and to do whatever he commanded. Shimei also, the son of Gera, prostrated himself before the king when he had just crossed the Jordan.
2 Samuel 19:20 He said to the king: “My lord, do not hold my iniquity against me. Let what your servant did perversely on the day my Lord the King departed from Jerusalem not be remembered. Do not take it to heart, O King.
2 Samuel 19:21 For your servant knows that I have sinned. And because of this, behold, I am the first of all the house of Joseph —meaning the northern tribes of Israel— to come down and meet you, my Lord the King.”
2 Samuel 19:22 But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, answered and said: “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord’s anointed king?”
2 Samuel 19:23 And David said: “What have I to do with you, sons of Zeruiah? Why do you oppose me today? Shall any man be put to death in Israel today? Do you not know that today I have been established as king over Israel?”
2 Samuel 19:24 And the king said to Shimei: “You shall not die.” And the king swore an oath to him.
2 Samuel 19:25 Mephibosheth, the son of Saul, also came down to meet the king. He had not washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes from the day the king had departed in flight until the day he returned in peace.
2 Samuel 19:26 When he had greeted the king, the king said to him: “Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?”
2 Samuel 19:27 And he answered, saying: “My Lord the king, my servant Ziba deceived me. For I said to him, ‘Saddle an ass for me, so I may ride on it and go with the king,’ for I am lame.
2 Samuel 19:28 And he —Ziba— has falsely slandered me to you, my lord the king. But you, my lord the king, are like an angel of God. Do what pleases you.
2 Samuel 19:29 For indeed, the house of my father —Saul's house— was deserving of nothing but death from my lord the king. Yet you placed your servant among those who eat at your own table. So what just reason do I have to still complain to the king?”
2 Samuel 19:30 And the king said: “Why do you speak further? I have said: you and Ziba shall divide the land possessions.”
2 Samuel 19:31 Then Mephibosheth said to the king: “Indeed, let him —Ziba— take everything, now that my Lord the King has returned to his house in peace.”
2 Samuel 19:32 Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim, and he crossed the Jordan with the king to escort him and provide for him on his journey.
2 Samuel 19:33 Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. And he had provided sustenance for the king while he stayed at Mahanaim. For he was a very wealthy man.
2 Samuel 19:34 So the king said to Barzillai: “Come with me, so that you may be cared for by me in Jerusalem.”
2 Samuel 19:35 And Barzillai answered the king: “How many days are there in the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
2 Samuel 19:36 I am eighty years old today. Can I still discern what is good or bad? Can your servant still delight in food or drink? Can I still hear the voice of male or female singers? Why should your servant be a burden to my Lord the King?
2 Samuel 19:37 Let your servant just escort the king across the Jordan. Do not repay me with this kindness that I cannot fully appreciate.
2 Samuel 19:38 But let your servant return, and I will die in my own city, and be buried beside the tomb of my father and my mother. However, your servant Chimham is here. Let him go with you, my Lord the King, and do for him whatever pleases you.”
2 Samuel 19:39 And the king said: “Let Chimham go with me, and I will do for him whatever pleases you. And anything you request of me, you shall obtain.”
2 Samuel 19:40 Then all the people crossed the Jordan, and the king was in their midst. And when the king returned, he came to Gilgal, and Chimham with him. All the people of Judah had escorted the king, and half of the people of Israel.
2 Samuel 19:1 And it was reported to Joab that the king was weeping and mourning over Absalom.
2 Samuel 19:2 And all the joy of the people turned into mourning on that day, because the people heard that the king was grieving deeply over his son.
2 Samuel 19:3 And the people entered the city in a stealthy manner on that day, just as a people who are ashamed and have fled from battle are accustomed to enter secretly.
2 Samuel 19:4 But the king was crying out, with his face covered, and with a loud voice, saying: "My son Absalom, my son Absalom! Oh, that I had died for you, my son Absalom!"
2 Samuel 19:5 So Joab came to the king in his house and said: "Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants who have fought today for your life, and for the lives of your sons and your daughters, and for the lives of your wives, and for the lives of your concubines."
2 Samuel 19:6 "You love those who hate you, and you hate those who love you. And you have shown today that you care nothing for your commanders and your servants. Indeed, I know now that if Absalom were alive, and all of us had died today, then that would have pleased you."
2 Samuel 19:7 "So now, get up and go out, and speak words of comfort to your servants. For I swear to you by the Lord, that if you do not go out, not even one man will remain with you this night. And this will be worse for you than all the evils that have happened to you from your youth until now."
2 Samuel 19:8 So the king got up and sat in the city gate. And it was announced to all the people that the king was sitting in the gate. Then all the multitude came before the king.
2 Samuel 19:9 Meanwhile, all of Israel had fled to their tents.
2 Samuel 19:10 And all the people were contending throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying: "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies, and he himself rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. And now he had been forced to flee from the land because of Absalom."
2 Samuel 19:11 "But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now then, why do you not take steps to bring the king back?"
2 Samuel 19:12 Now King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, saying: "Speak to the elders of Judah, saying: 'Why are you the very last to bring the king back to his house?'" For the words of all Israel had reached the king in his house.
2 Samuel 19:13 "And say to Amasa: 'Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more also, if you are not commander of my army before me at all times instead of Joab.'"
2 Samuel 19:14 And he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man. So they sent word to the king, saying: "Return, you and all your servants."
2 Samuel 19:15 So the king returned and came as far as the Jordan River. And Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king, to escort him across the Jordan.
2 Samuel 19:16 But Shimei, the son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
2 Samuel 19:17 And a thousand men of Benjamin were with him. Also Ziba, the servant of Saul's house, with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, were with him. And they rushed into the Jordan, going ahead of the king.
2 Samuel 19:18 And they crossed the ford to help the king's household cross over and to do whatever he commanded. And Shimei himself prostrated himself before the king, after the king had already crossed the Jordan.
2 Samuel 19:19 He said to the king: "Do not count against me, my lord, this iniquity, nor remember what I did wickedly on the day when you departed from Jerusalem, my lord the king. Let your heart not bear a grudge, O king."
2 Samuel 19:20 "For I, your servant, confess my sin. And behold, for this reason, I am the first of all the house of Joseph — meaning the northern tribes of Israel — who has come down today to meet my lord the king."
2 Samuel 19:21 But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, answered and said: "Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?"
2 Samuel 19:22 And David said: "What have I to do with you, sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death in Israel today? Do I not know today that I am established as king over Israel?"
2 Samuel 19:23 And the king said to Shimei: "You shall not die." And the king swore an oath to him.
2 Samuel 19:24 Mephibosheth, the son of Saul, also came down to meet the king. And he was in mourning, with unwashed feet and an untrimmed beard, from the day the king had departed until the day of his peaceful return.
2 Samuel 19:25 When he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him: "Why did you not come with me, Mephibosheth?"
2 Samuel 19:26 He answered and said: "My lord the king, my servant Ziba despised me. For I said to him that he should saddle a donkey for me, so that I might ride upon it and go with the king, because your servant is lame."
2 Samuel 19:27 "And he himself, your servant Ziba, has slandered me to you, my lord the king. But you, O king, are like an angel of God; do what is pleasing to you."
2 Samuel 19:28 "For there was nothing from all my father's house but that which was worthy of death before you. Yet you placed your servant among those who eat at your table. What then do I have to complain about justly? Or what more can I cry out to the king?"
2 Samuel 19:29 And the king said to him: "Why do you speak further? I have decided: You and Ziba divide the land."
2 Samuel 19:30 And Mephibosheth answered the king: "Let him even take everything, since my lord the king has returned to his house in peace."
2 Samuel 19:31 Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim and accompanied the king across the Jordan, to go with him beyond the Jordan.
2 Samuel 19:32 Now Barzillai was very old, that is, eighty years old. And he himself had provided for the king while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.
2 Samuel 19:33 And the king said to Barzillai: "Come with me, that you may rest with me in Jerusalem."
2 Samuel 19:34 And Barzillai said to the king: "How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
2 Samuel 19:35 "I am eighty years old today. Can I still discern good from bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or drink? Can I still hear the voice of male and female singers? Why should your servant be a burden to you in all these things?"
2 Samuel 19:36 "Your servant will only tarry a little while across the Jordan. I beg you, let me return and die in my own city, and be buried near the tomb of my father and my mother. Behold, your servant Chimham is here; let him go with you, my lord the king, and do for him whatever pleases you."
2 Samuel 19:37 And the king said: "Let Chimham go with you, and I will do for him whatever pleases you, and everything you ask of me, you shall obtain."
2 Samuel 19:38 When all the people had crossed the Jordan, and the king also crossed over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him. And Barzillai returned to his own place.
2 Samuel 19:39 So the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham with him. All the people of Judah had escorted the king, and half the people of Israel as well.
2 Samuel 19:40 And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, saying to the king: "Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king, and his household, and all the men of David with him, across the river?"
2 Samuel 20:1 And behold, there was a lawless man there, named Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite. This man blew a trumpet, and cried out, saying: "We have no portion with David, nor do we have any inheritance in the son of Jesse—that is, in David's lineage! Every man, return now to your own homes, O Israel!"
2 Samuel 20:2 So all the other tribes of Israel withdrew their loyalty from David and followed Sheba, the son of Bichri. However, the men of Judah remained completely loyal to their king, from the Jordan River all the way to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 20:3 When King David arrived at his house in Jerusalem, he took his ten concubine women whom he had left behind to watch over the palace during his flight. Because they had been defiled by Absalom, David placed them in a secluded house, like women in widowhood. He provided them with food and everything they needed, but he never had relations with them again. They remained shut away in this condition until the day they died, living as if they were true widows.
2 Samuel 20:4 Then King David said to Amasa: "Summon all the men of Judah to assemble for me within three days, and make sure that you yourself are present."
2 Samuel 20:5 So Amasa went out to summon Judah, but he delayed much longer than the time the king had set for him to return.
2 Samuel 20:6 Therefore, David said to Abishai: "Now Sheba, the son of Bichri, will do us more harm than Absalom ever did. Take therefore your master's servants—that is, my personal guard—and pursue him, lest he seize fortified cities and escape from us."
2 Samuel 20:7 So Joab's men went out with Abishai, along with the Cherethites, and the Pelethites—that is, David's elite guard—and all the strong warriors. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba, the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel 20:8 As they were near the great stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was girded with his military tunic over his usual garment, and around his waist was a tightly fastened belt with a dagger sheathed in it. As he went forward, the dagger immediately fell out of its sheath and to the lower part of his body—unbeknownst to Amasa, this was a deliberate maneuver.
2 Samuel 20:9 And Joab said to Amasa: "Greetings, my brother!" Then with his right hand, Joab took hold of Amasa's beard, as if to kiss him.
2 Samuel 20:10 But Amasa did not notice the sword that Joab held in his left hand. With it, Joab struck him in the side, spilling his intestines out onto the ground. He did not need a second wound; Amasa died immediately. After this, Joab and Abishai, his brother, continued their pursuit of Sheba, the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel 20:11 And one of Joab's servants, standing by Amasa's body, cried out: "Whoever is for Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!"
2 Samuel 20:12 Now Amasa was writhing in his own blood in the middle of the road. That man saw that all the people were stopping because of the sight. So he dragged Amasa off the road into a field and covered him with a garment, so that passersby would not stop and hinder the pursuit because of him.
2 Samuel 20:13 Once Amasa was removed from the road, all the men who were following Joab continued their march to pursue Sheba, the son of Bichri.
2 Samuel 20:14 Sheba, however, passed through all the tribes of Israel, going to Abel of Beth-Maachah, and through all the communities of the Berites. There, all the people gathered and followed him.
2 Samuel 20:15 So Joab arrived and besieged Sheba in Abel of Beth-Maachah. They built a siege ramp and a trench around the city. Then all the troops who were with Joab took their positions and began to undermine the city walls.
2 Samuel 20:16 Then a wise woman from the city called out: "Listen! Listen! Speak to Joab! Tell him to come closer, so I may speak with him."
2 Samuel 20:17 When Joab approached, she asked: "Are you Joab?" He answered: "I am." And she said: "Hear the words of your handmaid." He replied: "I am listening."
2 Samuel 20:18 Then she spoke: "There is an old saying, and it is spoken: 'Whoever inquires in Abel, that is how the matter is resolved.'"
2 Samuel 20:19 She continued: "I am among those who seek counsel and pursue peace in Israel. Yet you are trying to overthrow a city, and to destroy a mother in Israel—a principal city. Why would you devastate the inheritance of the Lord?"
2 Samuel 20:20 And Joab answered, saying: "Far be it, far be it from me! This will never happen!"
2 Samuel 20:21 He continued: "That is not the case at all! Rather, a man from the hill country of Ephraim, named Sheba, the son of Bichri, has raised his hand in rebellion against King David. Just hand him over, and we will withdraw from the city." And the woman said to Joab: "Behold, his head will be thrown over the wall to you."
2 Samuel 20:22 So the woman went to all the people and spoke to them with wisdom. Then they cut off the head of Sheba, the son of Bichri, and threw it over the wall to Joab. Joab then blew the trumpet, and all the men dispersed from the city, each returning to his own home. Joab, for his part, returned to Jerusalem to the king.
2 Samuel 20:23 Now Joab was in command of all the army of Israel. Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in command over the Cherethites and the Pelethites—David's personal bodyguards.
2 Samuel 20:24 Adoram was in charge of collecting tribute. Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder of official records.
2 Samuel 20:25 Sheva was the secretary. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.
2 Samuel 20:26 And Ira, the Jairite, was also a priest alongside David, serving as his personal chaplain.
2 Samuel 20:1 It happened then that a wicked man named Sheba, son of Bochri, from the tribe of Benjamin, found a trumpet and blew it, declaring to the people: "We have no portion in David! We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse (meaning King David)! Everyone to your tents, O Israel!" So all the people of Israel turned away from David and followed Sheba, son of Bochri. But the men of Judah remained loyal to their king, accompanying him from the Jordan River all the way to Jerusalem.
2 Samuel 20:2 When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, the king took the ten concubines whom he had left behind to guard the household. He placed them under house arrest, providing for their sustenance, but he no longer had marital relations with them. They remained confined, living as widows until the day they died.
2 Samuel 20:3 Indeed, when the king arrived at his house in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubine women whom he had sent away to guard the house. He confined them to a house, placing them under guard, and provided them with food. He did not go in to them, and they remained locked away, living like widows until their death.
2 Samuel 20:4 Then the king said to Amasa: "Call the men of Judah for me to gather by the third day, and you must be present there yourself."
2 Samuel 20:5 So Amasa went to summon the men of Judah, but he delayed beyond the appointed time that the king had set for him.
2 Samuel 20:6 And David said to Abishai: "Now Sheba, son of Bochri, will do us more harm than Absalom did. Therefore, take your master's soldiers and pursue him, lest he find fortified cities and escape from us."
2 Samuel 20:7 So Joab's men went out after Abishai, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty warriors. They left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba, son of Bochri.
2 Samuel 20:8 When they were near the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was dressed in his military uniform, and over it, a sword was belted to his waist, sheathed at his side. As he stepped forward, the sword slipped out of its sheath and fell.
2 Samuel 20:9 And Joab said to Amasa: "Greetings, my brother!" Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand, as if to kiss him.
2 Samuel 20:10 But Amasa did not pay attention to the sword that Joab held in his left hand. Joab then stabbed him in the side, piercing his groin, and spilled his intestines onto the ground. He did not need to strike a second blow, and Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai continued their pursuit of Sheba, son of Bochri.
2 Samuel 20:11 Meanwhile, one of Joab's young men (soldiers) stood by Amasa's body and said: "Let anyone who is for Joab, and who is for David, follow us!"
2 Samuel 20:12 Now Amasa lay writhing in his blood in the middle of the road. That soldier saw that all the people who were passing by were stopping to look. So he dragged Amasa from the road into a field and covered him with a garment, so that the sight of him would not delay the people who were passing by.
2 Samuel 20:13 Therefore, once Amasa's body was removed from the road, all the men continued on to pursue Sheba, son of Bochri, with Joab and all who were with him.
2 Samuel 20:14 Sheba then traveled through all the tribes of Israel and came to Abel of Beth Maachah and all the Berites. There, many people gathered and followed him.
2 Samuel 20:15 Joab's forces came and besieged Sheba in Abel of Beth Maachah. They surrounded the city, and against its walls, they built a siege ramp. All the multitude that was with Joab began undermining the wall, attempting to cause it to collapse.
2 Samuel 20:16 Then a wise woman cried out from the city: "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab: Come near here, and I will speak with you."
2 Samuel 20:17 When Joab approached her, the woman asked: "Are you Joab?" And he answered: "I am." She said to him: "Hear the words of your servant." And he replied: "I hear."
2 Samuel 20:18 And she said: "There is an old saying among the people who would declare: 'When they seek counsel in Abel, they bring matters to completion.'" (This proverb highlights Abel's reputation as a place of wisdom and resolution.)
2 Samuel 20:19 I am one of those who seek peace and receive a peaceful answer in Israel. So why do you want to destroy a city that is one of the chief cities in Israel? And why do you seek to ruin the inheritance of the Lord (meaning God's people)?
2 Samuel 20:20 And Joab answered, saying: "Far be it from me, far be it from me, that I should destroy or demolish anything!"
2 Samuel 20:21 That is not the case. Instead, a man from the hill country of Ephraim, named Sheba, son of Bochri, has raised his hand against King David. Hand over him alone, and we will withdraw from the city." And the woman said to Joab: "Behold, his head will be thrown over the wall to you."
2 Samuel 20:22 So the woman went to all the people and spoke to them wisely. And they cut off the head of Sheba, son of Bochri, and threw it to Joab. He immediately blew the trumpet, signaling the end of the siege, and they withdrew from the city, each man returning to his own tents. Joab then returned to Jerusalem to the king.
2 Samuel 20:23 Therefore, Joab remained commander over all the army of Israel. Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the Cherethites and the Pelethites (David's elite bodyguard and executioners).
2 Samuel 20:24 Adoram was in charge of the tribute (overseeing forced labor and taxes). Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the recorder (the royal chronicler or secretary of state).
2 Samuel 20:25 Sheva was the scribe (the secretary who managed royal correspondence and records). And Zadok and Abiathar were the priests (the two high priests serving David).
2 Samuel 20:26 Moreover, Ira the Jairite was also a priest for David (likely a personal or honorary priestly advisor to the king).
2 Samuel 21:1 And a famine came upon the land during the reign of King David, and this famine lasted for three continuous years. King David sought to know the reason, so he consulted the oracle of the Lord for divine instruction. And the Lord revealed: 'This famine is because of Saul, and because of his entire house, which is guilty of shedding innocent blood — a bloodguilt incurred when Saul, in his zeal, massacred the Gibeonites.'
2 Samuel 21:2 So King David called the Gibeonites to him and spoke with them. (Now, the Gibeonites were not from the Israelite people, but were a remnant of the Amorites. The sons of Israel had sworn an oath to them long ago, but Saul, in his misguided zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah, had sought to kill them all.)
2 Samuel 21:3 Then David said to the Gibeonites: 'What must I do for you? And what atonement can be made, so that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord — meaning, the people and land of Israel?'
2 Samuel 21:4 And the Gibeonites answered him: 'It is not a matter of silver or gold for us concerning Saul or his house. Nor do we desire that any specific man of Israel be put to death by our hand.' But they had something else in mind. And David said to them: 'Whatever you ask for, I will do it for you.'
2 Samuel 21:5 They responded to the king: 'Concerning the man who crushed us, who utterly destroyed us, and who planned for us to be completely annihilated — so that we would no longer exist within any of the borders of Israel—'
2 Samuel 21:6 'Let seven men from his sons be given to us. We will then impale them before the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, the very place where Saul, the Lord's chosen king, once lived.' And the king said: 'I will give them to you.'
2 Samuel 21:7 However, the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, who was Saul's son. He did this because of the solemn oath made before the Lord that had existed between David and Jonathan, Saul's son.
2 Samuel 21:8 So King David took two sons of Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, whom she had borne to Saul: Armoni and Mephibosheth. He also took the five sons of Michal, daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
2 Samuel 21:9 And David gave these seven men into the hand of the Gibeonites. They impaled them on the mountain before the Lord. And these seven fell together — they died on the very first days of the harvest, right as the people were beginning to cut the wheat.
2 Samuel 21:10 But Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth and spread it for herself on a rock from the beginning of the harvest season. She stayed there, watching over the bodies, until rain poured down upon them from the sky — signifying God's acceptance of the atonement. During all this time, she did not allow the birds of the sky to rest upon the bodies by day, nor the wild animals of the field to approach them by night.
2 Samuel 21:11 And it was reported to King David what Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, Saul's concubine, had done in her faithfulness.
2 Samuel 21:12 Then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-Gilead. These men had secretly taken them from the public square of Beth-Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they killed Saul on Mount Gilboa.
2 Samuel 21:13 And from there, David brought the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan. He also gathered the bones of those men who had been impaled.
2 Samuel 21:14 And they buried them — meaning, all the bones — with the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin, in Zela, in the tomb of Kish, Saul's father. They carried out everything the king had commanded. After these things were done, God was appeased concerning the land, and the famine ended.
2 Samuel 21:15 Now, it happened again that there was a battle of the Philistines against Israel. David went down, and his servants went with him, and they fought against the Philistines. And during the fighting, David grew weary and exhausted.
2 Samuel 21:16 Then Ishbi-Benob, who was one of the descendants of the giant Rapha, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of bronze — equivalent to a heavy amount of gold — and who was armed with a new sword, tried to kill King David.
2 Samuel 21:17 But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, came to David's rescue. He struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore an oath to him, saying: 'You shall not go out with us into battle anymore, lest you extinguish the lamp of Israel' — meaning, the very light and hope of our nation.
2 Samuel 21:18 After this, another battle occurred in Gob against the Philistines. At that time, Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was also one of the descendants of the giant Rapha.
2 Samuel 21:19 And again, battle was fought in Gob against the Philistines. In this engagement, Elhanan, the craftsman — whose proper name `Adeodatus faber` means 'God-given artisan' — struck down the Gittite giant, who was surnamed Goliath, and whose spear shaft was so massive it resembled a weaver's beam.
2 Samuel 21:20 There was also another battle in Gath, in which there was a man of great stature. He had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot — that is, twenty-four digits in total. And he was also one of the descendants of the giant Rapha.
2 Samuel 21:21 And he — this giant — blasphemed Israel, challenging them. And Jonathan, the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down.
2 Samuel 21:22 These four — meaning these four giants from the lineage of Rapha who lived in Gath — all fell by the hand of King David and his servants.
2 Samuel 21:1 During David's reign, a famine that lasted continuously for three years occurred. So David inquired of the Lord, seeking His divine answer. The Lord then said: "This famine is because of Saul and his household's bloodguilt, and because he killed the Gibeonites."
2 Samuel 21:2 The king then summoned the Gibeonites and spoke with them. (The Gibeonites, by the way, were not descendants of Israel but were among the remaining Amorites. The sons of Israel had once sworn an oath to them, but Saul, in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah, had attempted to wipe them out.)
2 Samuel 21:3 David then asked the Gibeonites: "What do you want me to do for you? What atonement can I make so that you may bless the Lord's inheritance—His people and His land—and the famine will end?"
2 Samuel 21:4 The Gibeonites answered him: "Our claim against Saul and his house is not about silver or gold. Nor do we desire that any ordinary Israelite be put to death." David then pressed them again: "What then *do* you want me to do for you?"
2 Samuel 21:5 They answered the king: "Concerning the man who crushed us and cruelly persecuted us with the intent to wipe us out completely from all the borders of Israel—"
2 Samuel 21:6 "—let seven men of his descendants be given to us, so that they may be impaled before the Lord in Gibeon, Saul's city, who was once the Lord's chosen king." The king replied: "I will give them."
2 Samuel 21:7 However, the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan (Saul's son), because of the sacred oath sworn before the Lord between David and Jonathan, Saul's son.
2 Samuel 21:8 So the king took the two sons of Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, whom Saul had fathered: Armoni and Mephibosheth. He also took the five sons of Michal, Saul's daughter, whom Hadriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite, had fathered.
2 Samuel 21:9 And he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, who then impaled them on the mountain before the Lord. These seven died together during the first days of the harvest, right at the beginning of the barley harvest.
2 Samuel 21:10 Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, also took sackcloth for herself and spread it out upon a rock, making a vigil. She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until the rains finally poured down on the bodies from the sky. During that entire time, she did not allow the birds of the sky to settle on them by day, nor the wild beasts of the field to approach them by night.
2 Samuel 21:11 And it was reported to David what Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, Saul's concubine, had done.
2 Samuel 21:12 David then went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-Gilead. These men had previously rescued the bodies, stealing them from the public square of Beth-Shan, where the Philistines had displayed them after killing Saul on Mount Gilboa.
2 Samuel 21:13 From there, David brought the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan. He also gathered the bones of those who had been impaled by the Gibeonites.
2 Samuel 21:14 And they buried them (the bones of the seven impaled men) along with the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan, in the land of Benjamin, in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish, Saul's father. They carried out everything the king had commanded. After these acts, God was finally appeased for the land of Israel.
2 Samuel 22:1 David spoke this song to the Lord, on the very day the Lord had rescued him from the power of all his enemies, and from the power of Saul.
2 Samuel 22:2 And David said: “The Lord is my strength and my fortified place, my refuge and my savior.
2 Samuel 22:3 My God is my Rock, in Him I will trust. He is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my sanctuary. My Savior, you will deliver me from injustice.
2 Samuel 22:4 When I call upon the Lord with praise, I will be saved from my enemies.
2 Samuel 22:5 For the waves of death had surrounded me; the destructive currents of iniquity terrified me.
2 Samuel 22:6 The snares of hell encircled me; the traps of death had seized me.
2 Samuel 22:7 In my distress, I called upon the Lord, and cried out to my God. And from His holy temple, He heard my voice, and my cry came to His ears.
2 Samuel 22:8 Then the earth shook and trembled, the foundations of the mountains were stirred, and they were made low, because the Lord was angry with them.
2 Samuel 22:9 Smoke rose from His nostrils, and fire from His mouth devoured; burning coals were ignited by Him.
2 Samuel 22:10 He bowed the sky and came down, and thick darkness was under His feet.
2 Samuel 22:11 And He rode upon a Cherub and flew; He glided upon the wings of the winds.
2 Samuel 22:12 He made darkness His hidden place all around Him, His tent was all around Him: dark water and thick clouds of the sky.
2 Samuel 22:13 From the brilliance before Him, coals of fire were kindled.
2 Samuel 22:14 The Lord thundered from the sky, and the Most High gave forth His voice.
2 Samuel 22:15 He sent forth arrows and scattered them; He sent lightning and put them to flight.
2 Samuel 22:16 Then the ocean floor became visible, and the foundations of the earth were uncovered at the Lord's rebuke, at the blast of the breath of His fury.
2 Samuel 22:17 He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He drew me out of many waters.
2 Samuel 22:18 He rescued me from my mighty enemies, and from those who hated me, because they were too strong for me.
2 Samuel 22:19 They confronted me on the day of my distress, but the Lord became my protector.
2 Samuel 22:20 And He brought me out into a wide-open place; He delivered me because I was pleasing to Him.
2 Samuel 22:21 The Lord will reward me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands, He will repay me.
2 Samuel 22:22 Because I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not acted wickedly against my God.
2 Samuel 22:23 For all His judgments are before my eyes, and I have not turned His commands away from me.
2 Samuel 22:24 I will be blameless before Him, and I will keep myself from my iniquity.
2 Samuel 22:25 Therefore the Lord will repay me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands in the sight of His eyes.
2 Samuel 22:26 With the holy, You will be holy; and with the mighty, You will be perfect.
2 Samuel 22:27 With the chosen, You will be chosen; and with the perverse, You will be perverse.
2 Samuel 22:28 And You will save the humble people, but You will humble the eyes of the proud.
2 Samuel 22:29 For You, O Lord, are my lamp; and You, O Lord, will illuminate my darkness.
2 Samuel 22:30 For by Your help, I will charge into battle prepared, and by the power of my God, I will leap over any wall.
2 Samuel 22:31 God makes my way perfect; the word of the Lord is proven by fire; He is a shield to all who trust in Him.
2 Samuel 22:32 For who is God except the Lord? And who is strong besides our God?
2 Samuel 22:33 God is the one who has girded me with strength and made my path perfect.
2 Samuel 22:34 He made my feet like those of deer, enabling me to stand firm on my high places.
2 Samuel 22:35 He trains my hands for battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
2 Samuel 22:36 You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, and Your gentleness has made me great.
2 Samuel 22:37 You will make my steps wide beneath me, and my ankles will not falter.
2 Samuel 22:38 I will pursue my enemies and crush them; I will not turn back until I have destroyed them.
2 Samuel 22:39 I will consume them and break them, so that they cannot rise; they will fall beneath my feet.
2 Samuel 22:40 You have girded me with strength for the battle; You have subdued those who rise against me beneath my power.
2 Samuel 23:1 These are the final words of David. David, the son of Jesse, declared them. Thus declared the man who was established by the Anointed One of the God of Jacob, the excellent psalmist of Israel:
2 Samuel 23:2 The Spirit of the Lord has spoken through me, and His word has been on my tongue.
2 Samuel 23:3 The God of Israel has spoken, the Strong One of Israel has spoken to me: 'The Ruler over humanity is a just ruler, ruling in the fear of God.'
2 Samuel 23:4 His rule will be like the morning light when the sun rises without clouds, shining brightly. It will be like the grass that sprouts from the earth after the rains.
2 Samuel 23:5 Indeed, my household is not so great before God, for He has made an eternal covenant with me, firm in all things and secured. For all my salvation and all my desire come from Him, and His covenant will not fail in the future.
2 Samuel 23:6 But all the sons of Belial (worthless men) are like burning thorns that cannot be grasped by hand.
2 Samuel 23:7 And if anyone wishes to touch them, he must be armed with iron and a spear shaft, and they will be utterly consumed by fire in that very place.
2 Samuel 23:8 These are the names of David’s mighty warriors: Isboseth, who sat on the throne, the wisest prince among the top three warriors. He was like a very tender worm in wood, yet he killed eight hundred men in one attack.
2 Samuel 23:9 After him was Eleazar, the son of his uncle Ahohite, one of the three mighty men who were with David when they defied the Philistines, who had gathered there for battle.
2 Samuel 23:10 When the men of Israel had gone up, he stood firm and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary and stiff from holding his sword. The Lord brought about a great victory on that day, and the people who had fled returned only to plunder the dead.
2 Samuel 23:11 And after him was Semma, the son of Age from Arari. The Philistines had gathered at Lehi; there was a field full of lentils there. When the people fled from the Philistines,
2 Samuel 23:12 He himself stood in the middle of the field and defended it. He struck down the Philistines, and the Lord brought about a great victory.
2 Samuel 23:13 Three of the thirty chief warriors went down and came to David during the rye harvest, into the cave of Odollam. The Philistine army was encamped in the valley of Raphaim.
2 Samuel 23:14 And David was in a stronghold there, while the Philistine outpost was then in Bethlehem.
2 Samuel 23:15 David then expressed a longing, saying, 'If only someone would give me water from the cistern of Bethlehem, which is near the gate!'
2 Samuel 23:16 So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the cistern of Bethlehem, which was at the gate. They brought it to David, but David refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the Lord, saying:
2 Samuel 23:17 'May the Lord be merciful to me, that I should not do this. Should I drink the blood of these men who went risking their very lives?' And he refused to drink it. These three mighty deeds were performed by the strongest warriors.
2 Samuel 23:18 Abisai also, the brother of Joab, son of Sarvia, was a chief among a group of three. He was the one who lifted his spear against three hundred men and killed them, and he was renowned among this group of three.
2 Samuel 23:19 And he was the most powerful among these three, and he became their commander. Nevertheless, he did not reach the status of the first three (the top warriors).
2 Samuel 23:20 Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was a very robust man, capable of great deeds, from Cabseel. He struck down two lion-like men of Moab, and he also went down into a cistern and struck down a lion on a snowy day.
2 Samuel 23:21 He also killed an Egyptian man of extraordinary stature, who had a spear in his hand. Benaiah went down to him with a staff, snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
2 Samuel 23:22 These deeds were done by Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada.
2 Samuel 23:23 And he was renowned among the three powerful ones, who themselves were considered more noble than the thirty other warriors; nevertheless, he did not attain the rank of the first three (top warriors). David made him his privy counselor.
2 Samuel 23:24 Asael, Joab's brother, was among the thirty warriors; Eleanan, the son of his uncle, from Bethlehem.
2 Samuel 23:25 Samma from Harodi, Elica from Harodi.
2 Samuel 23:26 Heles from Palti, Hira, the son of Acces, from Thecua.
2 Samuel 23:27 Abiezer from Anathoth, Mobonnai from Husati.
2 Samuel 23:28 Selmon, an Ahohite; Maharai, a Netophathite.
2 Samuel 23:29 Heled, the son of Banaa, from Netophath; Ithai, the son of Ribai, from Gabaath of the children of Benjamin.
2 Samuel 23:30 Benaiah, a Pharathonite; Hiddai from Nahale Gaas.
2 Samuel 23:31 Abialbon, an Arbathite; Azmaveth from Beromi.
2 Samuel 23:32 Eliaba from Saalboni, along with the sons of Jasen: Jonathan.
2 Samuel 23:33 Samma from Arari, Ahiam, the son of Sarar, from Arari.
2 Samuel 23:34 Eliphelet, the son of Ahasbai, the son of Machati; Eliam, the son of Achitophel, a Gelonite.
2 Samuel 23:35 Hesrai from Carmelo, Pharai from Arbi.
2 Samuel 23:36 Igaal, the son of Nathan, from Soba; Bonni from Gadi.
2 Samuel 23:37 Selec, an Ammonite; Naharai, a Berothite, the armor-bearer of Joab, the son of Sarvia.
2 Samuel 23:38 Ira, a Jethrite; Gareb, a Jethrite.
2 Samuel 23:39 Uriah, the Hethite.
2 Samuel 23:40 In total, there were thirty-seven.
2 Samuel 23:1 These are David's last words. David, Jesse's son, declared this message: The man who was established by the God of Jacob as His anointed ruler, the renowned psalmist of Israel, spoke this revelation.
2 Samuel 23:2 The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me, and His message was on my tongue.
2 Samuel 23:3 The God of Israel spoke to me. The Strong One of Israel declared this truth: The Ruler of all humanity is a just ruler, governing in the reverent fear of God.
2 Samuel 23:4 His rule is like the morning light, shining brightly when the sun rises without clouds. It is like the rain that makes the earth sprout with life.
2 Samuel 23:5 Indeed, my royal house is not so great in God's sight, that He would enter into an eternal covenant with me, steadfast in every way and secured. Yet, this is all my salvation and all my desire; and even if no heir of mine should truly flourish by his own power, God's promise stands.
2 Samuel 23:6 But the wicked are all like thorns that have been torn out, which cannot be gathered by hand. If anyone desires to handle them, he must arm himself with iron and a spear, for they will surely be consumed by fire right where they are found.
2 Samuel 23:7 These are the names of David's mighty warriors. Josheb-basshebeth, the wisest chief among the three, was the same as Adino the Eznite, who with a single attack killed eight hundred men.
2 Samuel 23:8 After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo the Ahohite, who was among the three mighty warriors with David. They were with David when they defied the Philistines, who had gathered there for battle. When the men of Israel had retreated,
2 Samuel 23:9 Eleazar stood firm and fought the Philistines until his hand grew weary and stiff, clenched to his sword. And the Lord brought about a great victory on that day. The people who had fled then returned, but only to plunder the slain.
2 Samuel 23:10 After Eleazar was Shammah, son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had gathered in Lehi, where there was a field full of lentils. When the people fled from the Philistines,
2 Samuel 23:11 Shammah stood his ground in the middle of the field and defended it. He struck down the Philistines, and the Lord brought about a great victory.
2 Samuel 23:12 Three of the thirty chief warriors went down and came to David during harvest time at the cave of Adullam. At that time, the Philistine camp was set up in the Valley of Rephaim.
2 Samuel 23:13 At that time, David was in a stronghold, and a Philistine garrison was in Bethlehem.
2 Samuel 23:14 So David longed for water and said: 'Oh, if only someone would give me a drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the city gate!'
2 Samuel 23:15 So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well of Bethlehem, which was by the city gate. They brought it to David, but David refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the Lord,
2 Samuel 23:16 saying: 'May the Lord forbid that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?' And because of this, he would not drink it. These were the deeds of the three mighty warriors.
2 Samuel 23:17 Abishai, the brother of Joab, son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He was the one who lifted his spear against three hundred men and killed them; he became renowned among the three.
2 Samuel 23:18 He was the first among the three, and much more illustrious than the other two, and he became their commander. Nevertheless, he did not reach the level of the first three mighty warriors.
2 Samuel 23:19 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, a very mighty man who performed great deeds, came from Kabzeel. He killed two of Moab's most powerful warriors. He also went down into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day.
2 Samuel 23:20 He also struck down an Egyptian, a man of remarkable stature, who had a spear in his hand. Benaiah went down to him with only a staff, wrestled the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and then killed him with his own spear.
2 Samuel 23:21 These were the deeds of Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and he became renowned among the three mighty warriors.
2 Samuel 23:22 He was the chief of the thirty, though he did not reach the level of the first three. David appointed him as his chief counselor.
2 Samuel 23:23 Among the thirty were Asahel, Joab's brother, and Elhanan, son of Dodo from Bethlehem.
2 Samuel 23:24 Also, Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
2 Samuel 23:25 Helez the Paltite, Ira, son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,
2 Samuel 23:26 Abiezer from Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
2 Samuel 23:27 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
2 Samuel 23:28 Heled, son of Baanah from Netophah, Ittai, son of Ribai from Gibeon of the Benjamites,
2 Samuel 23:29 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the ravines of Gaash,
2 Samuel 23:30 Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Bahurimite,
2 Samuel 23:31 Eliaba the Shaalbonite, Jonathan, son of Jashen,
2 Samuel 23:32 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam, son of Sharar the Ararite,
2 Samuel 23:33 Eliphelet, son of Ahasbai from Maacah, Eliam, son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
2 Samuel 23:34 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
2 Samuel 23:35 Igal, son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
2 Samuel 23:36 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, who was the armor-bearer for Joab, son of Zeruiah,
2 Samuel 23:37 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
2 Samuel 23:38 Uriah the Hittite—in all, thirty-seven warriors.
2 Samuel 24:1 The Lord’s just anger continued to burn against Israel. He stirred up David to act against them, saying, “Go, take a census of the men of Israel and Judah.”
2 Samuel 24:2 So the king told Joab, the commander of his army: “Go throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, and count the people. I want to know their total number.”
2 Samuel 24:3 But Joab replied to the king: “May the Lord your God increase the number of these people a hundredfold more than they are now! And may my lord the king live to see it with his own eyes. Why, then, does my lord the king want to do this thing?”
2 Samuel 24:4 Yet the king insisted on his command to Joab and the army commanders. So Joab and the generals departed from the king’s presence to take a census of the people of Israel.
2 Samuel 24:5 When they had crossed the Jordan River, they came to Aroer, and to the city that is on the right side of the valley of Gad.
2 Samuel 24:6 From there, they went through Midian and Gilead, and into the lower land, that is, Hodesh. They came to the forested area of the Sun, which is the city of the Sidonians.
2 Samuel 24:7 They then traveled from there, facing Tyre, and through all the land of the Hivites and Canaanites. They finally arrived in the south of Judah, at Beersheba.
2 Samuel 24:8 After surveying all the land, they returned to Jerusalem after nine months and twenty days.
2 Samuel 24:9 Joab reported the number of the registered people to the king: In Israel, there were eight hundred thousand valiant men who could wield a sword. In Judah, there were five hundred thousand fighting men.
2 Samuel 24:10 But David’s conscience troubled him after he had counted the people. So he said to the Lord: “I have sinned greatly in this act. But I beg You, Lord, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted foolishly.”
2 Samuel 24:11 When David rose in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying:
2 Samuel 24:12 “Go, and speak to David: ‘This is what the Lord says: I offer you three choices. Choose one, and I will bring it upon you.’”
2 Samuel 24:13 When Gad came to David, he reported to him, saying: “Either seven years of famine will come upon your land, or for three months you will flee from your adversaries as they pursue you, or for three days there will be a plague in your land. Now then, decide, and see what answer I should give to the One who sent me.”
2 Samuel 24:14 And David said to Gad: “I am in a very distressed situation. But it is better that I fall into the hand of the Lord, for His compassions are great, rather than into the hand of man.”
2 Samuel 24:15 So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel from that morning until the appointed time. And from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand men among the people died.
2 Samuel 24:16 When the angel extended his hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord had pity on the afflicted people. He said to the angel who was destroying the people: “Enough! Do not extend your hand further.” Now the Lord’s angel was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
2 Samuel 24:17 And when David saw the angel striking the people, he said to the Lord: “It is I who have sinned, I have acted wickedly. These people are like sheep; what have they done? I beg You, let Your hand be turned against me and against my father’s house.”
2 Samuel 24:18 Now Gad came to David on that day and said to him: “Go up and erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
2 Samuel 24:19 So David went up, just as Gad had told him, according to the Lord’s command.
2 Samuel 24:20 Araunah looked up and saw the king and his servants coming toward him. So he went out to meet the king and prostrated himself before him with his face to the ground, showing his respect.
2 Samuel 24:21 And Araunah said: “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David replied to him: “To buy the threshing floor from you, so I can build an altar to the Lord and stop the plague of death from affecting the people.”
2 Samuel 24:22 Araunah said to David: “Let my lord the king take and offer whatever pleases him. You have oxen here for a burnt offering, and the threshing sledges, and the yokes of the oxen for wood.”
2 Samuel 24:23 Araunah the king gave all these things to the king. And Araunah said to the king: “May the Lord your God be gracious to you.”
2 Samuel 24:24 But the king replied to him: “No, not as you wish. I will certainly buy it from you for a price. For I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty silver shekels.
2 Samuel 24:25 And David built an altar there to the Lord, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the Lord was moved to mercy for the land, and the plague was lifted from Israel.
1 Kings 1:1 King David had grown old, and he was advanced in years. Even when he was covered with clothing, he could not get warm.
1 Kings 1:2 So his servants said to him: "Let us seek out for our lord, the king, a young virgin maiden. She can stand before the king, keep him warm, and sleep by his side to make our lord the king feel warm."
1 Kings 1:3 So they searched throughout all the borders of Israel for a beautiful young woman. They found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king.
1 Kings 1:4 The young woman was exceptionally beautiful. She cared for the king and ministered to him, but the king did not have sexual relations with her.
1 Kings 1:5 Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, began to boast, saying: "I will be king." He prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men who would run before him.
1 Kings 1:6 His father had never rebuked him at any time by saying: "Why have you done this?" Adonijah himself was also very handsome, being the next oldest son after Absalom.
1 Kings 1:7 He conspired with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. They both supported Adonijah and followed him.
1 Kings 1:8 However, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's mighty warriors were not with Adonijah.
1 Kings 1:9 Adonijah then offered sacrifices of sheep, calves, and all the fatlings by the Stone of Zoheleth, which is near the fountain of Rogel. He invited all the king's sons and all the men of Judah who were the king's servants.
1 Kings 1:10 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon.
1 Kings 1:11 So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, saying: "Have you heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king, and our lord David knows nothing about it?"
1 Kings 1:12 "Now therefore, come, I will give you advice so that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon."
1 Kings 1:13 "Go, and go in to King David, and say to him: 'My lord king, did you not swear to me, your handmaid, saying: "Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?" Why then does Adonijah reign?'"
1 Kings 1:14 "And while you are still speaking there with the king, I will immediately come in after you and confirm your words."
1 Kings 1:15 So Bathsheba went in to the king in his private chamber. The king had grown very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to him.
1 Kings 1:16 Bathsheba bowed down and paid homage to the king. The king asked her: "What do you want?"
1 Kings 1:17 She answered, saying: "My lord, you swore by the Lord your God to your handmaid, that your son Solomon would reign after you, and that he himself would sit on your throne."
1 Kings 1:18 "And behold, now Adonijah reigns, and you, my lord king, do not know about it."
1 Kings 1:19 "He has sacrificed many oxen, fatlings, and sheep to all the king's sons, and to Zadok the priest, and to Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. But he did not invite your servant Solomon."
1 Kings 1:20 "But now, my lord king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, waiting for you to declare who will sit on your throne after you."
1 Kings 1:21 "Otherwise, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers (meaning, when you die), I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders and will likely be put to death."
1 Kings 1:22 While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet entered.
1 Kings 1:23 They announced to the king, saying: "Behold, Nathan the prophet!" When he had come in before the king and bowed down before him with his face to the ground,
1 Kings 1:24 Nathan said: "My lord king, have you indeed declared: 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne'?"
1 Kings 1:25 "Because today he went down and sacrificed many oxen, fatlings, and sheep to all the king's sons, and to the commanders of the army, and to Abiathar the priest. And they are eating and drinking before him and shouting: 'Long live King Adonijah!'"
1 Kings 1:26 "But he did not invite me, your servant, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon."
1 Kings 1:27 "If this declaration has come from my lord the king, why have you not informed me, your servant, who should sit on your throne after you?"
1 Kings 1:28 Then King David answered, saying: "Call Bathsheba to me." When she had come in before the king and stood before him,
1 Kings 1:29 The king swore an oath and said: "As the Lord lives, who has rescued my life from every trouble and distress,"
1 Kings 1:30 "Just as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,' so I will do this very day."
1 Kings 1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground, and paying homage to the king, she said: "May my lord King David live forever!"
1 Kings 1:32 King David also said: "Call Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada to me." When they had come in before the king,
1 Kings 1:33 He said to them: "Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own royal mule, and bring him down to Gihon."
1 Kings 1:34 "And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Then sound the trumpet and declare: 'Long live King Solomon!'"
1 Kings 1:35 "Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he himself shall reign in my place. For I have commanded that he be the leader over Israel and over Judah."
1 Kings 1:36 Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answered the king, saying: "Amen! May the Lord God of my lord the king confirm this as true!"
1 Kings 1:37 "Just as the Lord was with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and may He make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David."
1 Kings 1:38 So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down. They put Solomon upon King David's own royal mule and brought him to Gihon.
1 Kings 1:39 Then Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. They sounded the trumpet, and all the people shouted: "Long live King Solomon!"
1 Kings 1:40 And all the multitude went up after him, with the people playing flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so much so that the earth echoed from the sound of their shouting.
1 Kings 1:1 King David was now very old and advanced in years. Even when he was covered with blankets, he could not get warm.
1 Kings 1:2 So his servants said to him, "Let us look for a young, virgin girl for our lord the king. Let her serve the king and care for him, and let her sleep close to him to keep our lord the king warm."
1 Kings 1:3 So they searched throughout all the territory of Israel for a beautiful young woman, and they found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
1 Kings 1:4 The girl was indeed exceedingly beautiful, and she cared for the king and attended to his needs. But the king did not have sexual relations with her.
1 Kings 1:5 Adonijah, the son of Haggith, began to boast, saying, "I will be king!" He prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him as his personal guard.
1 Kings 1:6 His father had never corrected him at any time by asking, "Why are you doing this?" Adonijah himself was also very handsome, and he was the next eldest son after Absalom.
1 Kings 1:7 Adonijah consulted with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. They both gave their support to Adonijah and followed him.
1 Kings 1:8 However, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's mightiest warriors did not join Adonijah.
1 Kings 1:9 Adonijah sacrificed sheep, calves, and all the fatlings near the stone of Zoheleth, which is close to the spring of Rogel. He then invited all the king's sons and all the men of Judah who served the king.
1 Kings 1:10 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mightiest warriors, nor his brother Solomon.
1 Kings 1:11 So Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, Haggith's son, has made himself king, and our master David does not even know about it?"
1 Kings 1:12 Now then, come, and I will give you advice so that you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
1 Kings 1:13 Go, enter King David's presence, and say to him, "Did you not, my lord the king, swear to me, your handmaid, saying, 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne'? How then is Adonijah now reigning as king?"
1 Kings 1:14 While you are still speaking with the king there, I will immediately come in after you and confirm everything you have said.
1 Kings 1:15 So Bathsheba went into the king's chamber. The king was now very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to him.
1 Kings 1:16 Bathsheba bowed low and paid homage to the king. The king asked her, "What do you want?"
1 Kings 1:17 She replied, "My lord, you swore by the Lord your God to your handmaid that your son Solomon would reign after you, and that he himself would sit upon your throne."
1 Kings 1:18 And now, Adonijah is reigning as king, and you, my lord the king, do not even know about it.
1 Kings 1:19 He has sacrificed many oxen, fatlings, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the commander of the army. But he did not invite your servant Solomon.
1 Kings 1:20 So now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are looking to you, to declare who will sit on your throne after you.
1 Kings 1:21 Otherwise, when my lord the king passes away and rests with his ancestors, my son Solomon and I will be considered criminals and treated as such.
1 Kings 1:22 While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
1 Kings 1:23 They announced to the king, saying, "Nathan the prophet is here!" When he entered the king's presence, he bowed down with his face to the ground and paid homage.
1 Kings 1:24 Nathan said, "My lord the king, did you say that Adonijah is to reign after you, and that he is to sit upon my throne?"
1 Kings 1:25 For today he went down and sacrificed many oxen, fatlings, and sheep. He invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And they ate and drank before him, and shouted, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
1 Kings 1:26 But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, he did not invite.
1 Kings 1:27 Has this decree truly come from my lord the king? And have you not informed your servant who is to sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
1 Kings 1:28 King David answered, "Call Bathsheba to me." When she came into the king's presence and stood before him,
1 Kings 1:29 The king took an oath and said, "As the Lord lives, who has delivered my soul from every distress—"
1 Kings 1:30 —just as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my place,' this very day I will carry it out!"
1 Kings 1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, paid homage to the king, and said, "May my lord King David live forever!"
1 Kings 1:32 King David then gave an order: "Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." When they had come into the king's presence,
1 Kings 1:33 The king said to them, "Take with you my royal servants. Set my son Solomon upon my own mule and bring him down to Gihon."
1 Kings 1:34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Then blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King Solomon!'
1 Kings 1:35 Then return up here, following him. He is to sit upon my throne, and he himself shall reign in my place, for I have appointed him to be ruler over both Israel and Judah.
1 Kings 1:36 Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answered the king, saying, "So be it! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, confirm it."
1 Kings 1:37 Just as the Lord was with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and may He make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David.
1 Kings 1:38 So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites went down. They set Solomon upon King David's own mule and brought him to Gihon.
1 Kings 1:39 Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people shouted, 'Long live King Solomon!'
1 Kings 1:40 And all the multitude went up after him. The people were playing flutes and rejoicing with great joy, and the earth reverberated with their shouting.
1 Kings 1:1 King David was very old and advanced in years; even when he was covered with many blankets, he could not get warm.
1 Kings 1:2 So his servants said to him: "Let us find a young virgin for our Lord, the king, to take care of him. She can stand before the king, sleeping close to him, and keep our Lord, the king, warm."
1 Kings 1:3 So they searched throughout all the lands of Israel for a beautiful young woman. They found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king.
1 Kings 1:4 The young woman was very beautiful. She took care of the king and served him; however, the king did not have sexual relations with her.
1 Kings 1:5 Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, began to exalt himself, saying: "I will be king." He prepared chariots and horsemen for himself, along with fifty men to run before him.
1 Kings 1:6 His father, David, had never once rebuked him, asking: "Why have you done this?" Adonijah himself was also very handsome, and he was the next son born after Absalom.
1 Kings 1:7 Adonijah spoke with Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. They both helped Adonijah and followed him.
1 Kings 1:8 However, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the core of David's army were not with Adonijah.
1 Kings 1:9 Then Adonijah sacrificed sheep, calves, and all the fatted animals near the Stone of Zoheleth, which was beside the En Rogel spring. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.
1 Kings 1:10 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, nor any of the mighty men, nor his brother Solomon.
1 Kings 1:11 Then Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother: "Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king, and our Lord David does not know about it?"
1 Kings 1:12 Now then, come, accept my advice, and save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
1 Kings 1:13 Go and enter before King David. Say to him: "My Lord, the king, did you not swear to your handmaid, saying: 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne'? How then is Adonijah reigning?"
1 Kings 1:14 While you are still speaking there with the king, I will immediately come in after you and confirm your words.
1 Kings 1:15 So Bathsheba went in to the king in his private room. The king was now very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving him.
1 Kings 1:16 Bathsheba bowed down and paid homage to the king. The king said to her: "What do you want?"
1 Kings 1:17 She answered him: "My Lord, you swore by the Lord your God to your handmaid: 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne.'"
1 Kings 1:18 And now, look, Adonijah is reigning, and you, my Lord, the king, do not know it.
1 Kings 1:19 He has sacrificed many oxen, fatted animals, and sheep, and he has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab, the commander of the army. But he did not invite your servant Solomon, nor me, your handmaid.
1 Kings 1:20 Now, my Lord, the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, for you to declare to them who shall sit on your throne, my Lord, the king, after you.
1 Kings 1:21 Otherwise, when my Lord, the king, sleeps with his fathers (that is, when he dies), my son Solomon and I will be considered guilty and will suffer the consequences.
1 Kings 1:22 And look, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet entered.
1 Kings 1:23 They announced to the king, saying: "Nathan the prophet is here." When he had come in before the king and bowed down before him, with his face to the ground,
1 Kings 1:24 Nathan said: "My Lord, the king, did you say: 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne'?"
1 Kings 1:25 For he went down today and sacrificed many oxen, fatted animals, and sheep. He invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. While they are eating and drinking before him, they are shouting: "Long live King Adonijah!"
1 Kings 1:26 But he did not invite me, your servant, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon.
1 Kings 1:27 Has this word truly come from my Lord, the king, and you have not informed me, your servant, who should sit on your throne after you?
1 Kings 1:28 King David then answered, saying: "Call Bathsheba for me." When she had come in before the king and stood before him,
1 Kings 1:29 the king swore an oath and said: "As the Lord lives, who has rescued my life from every distress,"
1 Kings 1:30 just as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: 'Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne in my place,' I will do this very thing today.
1 Kings 1:31 Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king, saying: "May my Lord, King David, live forever!"
1 Kings 1:32 King David then also said: "Call for me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." When they had come in before the king,
1 Kings 1:33 he said to them: "Take with you the servants of your master. Have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and lead him down to Gihon."
1 Kings 1:34 There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him as king over Israel. Then sound the trumpet and declare: "Long live King Solomon!"
1 Kings 1:35 Then you shall come up after him. He will come and sit upon my throne, and he himself shall reign in my place, for I have commanded that he be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
1 Kings 1:36 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, saying: "Amen! May the Lord, the God of my Lord, the king, speak likewise (that is, confirm your word)."
1 Kings 1:37 Just as the Lord was with my Lord, the king, so may He be with Solomon. May He make Solomon's throne even greater than the throne of my Lord, King David.
1 Kings 1:38 So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down. They put Solomon on King David's mule and brought him to Gihon.
1 Kings 1:39 Then Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. They sounded the trumpet, and all the people shouted: "Long live King Solomon!"
1 Kings 1:40 And all the multitude went up after him. The people played flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so much so that the earth resounded from the loudness of their shouting.
1 Kings 2:1 As the day drew near for King David to die, he gave these final commands to Solomon, his son and successor:
1 Kings 2:2 “I am about to pass from this world, like all people must. So be strong, and act like a true man.
1 Kings 2:3 And faithfully keep the commandments of the Lord your God. Walk in His ways, observe His rituals, His precepts, His judgments, and His testimonies, just as it is written in the Law of Moses. Do this so that you may prosper in everything you undertake, and in every direction you go.
1 Kings 2:4 This is so the Lord may fulfill the promise He made to me, when He said: 'If your descendants faithfully keep My ways and walk before Me in truth, with their whole heart and their whole soul, you will never lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel.'
1 Kings 2:5 “You also know what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me and what he did to the two commanders of the army of Israel: Abner, the son of Ner, and Amasa, the son of Jether. He murdered them, shedding the blood of war in a time of peace, and stained his belt around his waist and his sandals on his feet with the blood of war.
1 Kings 2:6 Therefore, act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to the abode of the dead in peace.
1 Kings 2:7 But to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, show kindness. Let them be among those who eat at your table, because they showed me hospitality when I fled from your brother Absalom.
1 Kings 2:8 You also have with you Shimei, the son of Gera, from Bahurim, a Benjaminite, who cursed me with a terrible curse when I was going to the camp. But because he came down with me to the Jordan River, I swore to him by the Lord, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'
1 Kings 2:9 Therefore, do not let him go unpunished. You are a wise man, and you will know how to bring his gray head down to the abode of the dead with blood.
1 Kings 2:10 So David rested with his ancestors, and he was buried in the City of David.
1 Kings 2:11 The length of David's reign over Israel was forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
1 Kings 2:12 Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly established.
1 Kings 2:13 Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked him, “Are you coming in peace?” He answered, “I am.”
1 Kings 2:14 Then he added, “I have something to say to you.” She replied, “Speak.”
1 Kings 2:15 He said, “You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel expected me to be king. But the kingdom has been taken from me and given to my brother; for it was the Lord's will that it be prepared for him.”
1 Kings 2:16 “Now therefore, I ask one favor from you. Do not refuse my request.” She said to him, “Speak.”
1 Kings 2:17 He said, “Please speak to King Solomon—he cannot refuse you—and ask him to give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.”
1 Kings 2:18 Bathsheba replied, “Very well, I will speak to the king on your behalf.”
1 Kings 2:19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonijah. The king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne, and a throne was placed for the king's mother, and she sat at his right hand.
1 Kings 2:20 She said to him, “I have one small request to make of you. Do not refuse my request.” The king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for it is not right that I should refuse your request.”
1 Kings 2:21 Then she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife.”
1 Kings 2:22 King Solomon answered and said to his mother, “Why do you ask for Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask also for the kingdom for him! He is my elder brother, and he has Abiathar the priest and Joab, the son of Zeruiah, supporting him!”
1 Kings 2:23 Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, “May God do to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life by making this request!”
1 Kings 2:24 “Now, as the Lord lives, who has established me and seated me on the throne of my father David, and who has made me a lasting dynasty as He promised, Adonijah will surely be put to death this very day!”
1 Kings 2:25 So King Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who struck him down, and Adonijah died.
1 Kings 2:26 To Abiathar the priest, the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your own lands. You deserve to die, but today I will not put you to death, because you carried the Ark of the Lord God before my father David and endured all the hardships my father endured.”
1 Kings 2:27 So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, thereby fulfilling the word of the Lord that He had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
1 Kings 2:28 When the news reached Joab—because Joab had sided with Adonijah and not with Solomon—Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and grasped the horns of the altar, seeking sanctuary.
1 Kings 2:29 It was reported to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the Lord and was beside the altar. So Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down.”
1 Kings 2:30 Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to Joab, “Thus says the king: 'Come out!'” But Joab replied, “No, I will not come out; I will die here.” So Benaiah reported to the king, saying, “This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.”
1 Kings 2:31 The king then said to Benaiah, “Do as he has said; strike him down and bury him. In doing so, you will remove the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed from me and from my father's house.”
1 Kings 2:32 “And the Lord will bring his bloodguilt back upon his own head, because he struck down two men more righteous and better than himself. He murdered them with the sword, though my father David knew nothing of it: Abner, the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.”
1 Kings 2:33 “So their bloodguilt will fall upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants forever. But upon David and his descendants, upon his house, and upon his throne, may there be lasting peace from the Lord forever.”
1 Kings 2:34 So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up and struck him down and killed him. He was then buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1 Kings 2:35 The king then appointed Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, over the army in place of Joab, and he appointed Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar.
1 Kings 2:36 The king then sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there to any place else.”
1 Kings 2:37 “For on whatever day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, know for certain that you will surely die. Your blood will be on your own head.”
1 Kings 2:38 Shimei said to the king, “Your word is good. Just as my lord the king has said, so your servant will do.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
1 Kings 2:39 Now it happened three years later that servants of Shimei ran away to Gath, to Achish, son of Maachah, the king of Gath. And it was reported to Shimei, “Look, your servants are in Gath!”
1 Kings 2:40 So Shimei rose, saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to search for his servants, and he brought them back from Gath.
1 Kings 2:1 Now the days drew near when David had to die, and he gave a final command to his son Solomon, saying:
1 Kings 2:2 “I am about to go the way of all the earth, the way of all humanity. So be strong now, and show yourself to be a man.
1 Kings 2:3 And keep the observances of the Lord your God. Walk in His ways and keep His ceremonies, His precepts, His judgments, and His testimonies—just as it is written in the Law of Moses. Do this so that you may understand everything you do and everywhere you turn, and that you may prosper.
1 Kings 2:4 And also that the Lord may confirm His word which He spoke concerning me, saying: 'If your sons keep their way and walk before Me in truth, with all their heart and with all their soul, a man from your line shall not be cut off from the throne of Israel.'
1 Kings 2:5 “You also know what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me—what he did to the two commanders of the army of Israel, Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether. He killed them, shedding the blood of war in a time of peace, and he put the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet.
1 Kings 2:6 So, act according to your wisdom regarding him. Do not allow his gray hairs to go down to the underworld in peace, that is, do not let him die a natural death.
1 Kings 2:7 But to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, you must show kindness. Let them eat at your table, because they were there for me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
1 Kings 2:8 You also have with you Shimei, the son of Gera, a Benjaminite from Bahurim. He cursed me with a terrible curse when I went to Mahanaim, the place where I gathered my forces. But because he came down with me to the Jordan River, I swore to him by the Lord, saying: 'I will not put you to death with the sword.'
1 Kings 2:9 Therefore, do not leave him unpunished. But you are a wise man, and you know what you should do to him. Bring his gray hairs down to the underworld with blood, meaning, ensure he faces justice and dies a violent death.
1 Kings 2:10 So David rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.
1 Kings 2:11 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.
1 Kings 2:12 Then Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was very firmly established.
1 Kings 2:13 Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. She asked him: 'Is your coming peaceful?' And he answered: 'It is peaceful.'
1 Kings 2:14 And he added: 'I have something to say to you.' At which point she said: 'Speak.'
1 Kings 2:15 He said: 'You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had turned their faces toward me, expecting me to reign. But the kingdom has been transferred, and it has become my brother's, because it was established for him by the Lord.
1 Kings 2:16 Now therefore, I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse my plea.' And Bathsheba said to him: 'Speak.'
1 Kings 2:17 He said: 'I beg you to speak to King Solomon (for he cannot refuse you anything), that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.'
1 Kings 2:18 Bathsheba said: 'Very well. I will speak to the king for you.'
1 Kings 2:19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her, bowed down to her, and then sat on his throne. A chair was placed for the king's mother, and she sat at his right hand.
1 Kings 2:20 And she said to him: 'I have one small request to make of you. Do not refuse my plea.' And the king said to her: 'Ask, my mother; for it is not right that I should refuse you.'
1 Kings 2:21 She said: 'Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as a wife.'
1 Kings 2:22 And King Solomon answered and said to his mother: 'Why do you ask for Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask also for the kingdom for him! For he is my older brother, and he has Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah on his side.'
1 Kings 2:23 So King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: 'May God do so to me and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life, thereby sealing his own doom.'
1 Kings 2:24 And now, as the Lord lives, who has established me and seated me on the throne of David my father, and who has made for me a house, just as He promised—Adonijah shall surely be put to death today.
1 Kings 2:25 So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, who struck him down, and he died.
1 Kings 2:26 And to Abiathar the priest, the king said: 'Go to Anathoth, to your own fields. You deserve death, for you are a son of death. But today I will not put you to death, because you carried the Ark of the Lord God before David my father, and you endured hardship in all the difficulties my father endured.'
1 Kings 2:27 So Solomon cast out Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord. This happened so that the word of the Lord, which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh, might be fulfilled.
1 Kings 2:28 When the news reached Joab (for Joab had sided with Adonijah, and had not sided with Solomon), he fled to the tabernacle of the Lord and took hold of the horns of the altar.
1 Kings 2:29 It was reported to King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the Lord and was by the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying: 'Go and strike him down.'
1 Kings 2:30 So Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lord and said to him: 'Thus says the king: 'Come out!'' But Joab answered: 'No, I will not come out; I will die here.' So Benaiah reported the words to the king, saying: 'This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.'
1 Kings 2:31 And the king said to him: 'Do as he has spoken. Strike him down and bury him, so that you may remove the innocent blood which Joab shed from me and from the house of my father.
1 Kings 2:32 And the Lord will bring his blood back upon his own head because he struck down two men more righteous and better than himself in Israel, without my father David knowing it: Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.
1 Kings 2:33 Their blood shall return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his descendants forever. But upon David and his descendants, and his house, and his throne, there shall be peace and permanence forever from the Lord.'
1 Kings 2:34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and killed him. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1 Kings 2:35 And the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's place. And Zadok the priest he appointed in the place of Abiathar.
1 Kings 2:36 The king also sent and called for Shimei and said to him: 'Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, and do not go out from there anywhere else.
1 Kings 2:37 For on whatever day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, know for certain that you will surely die. Your blood will be on your own head—meaning, you will be responsible for your own death.'
1 Kings 2:38 And Shimei said to the king: 'The word is good. As my lord the king has spoken, so will your servant do.' So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.
1 Kings 2:39 But it came to pass after three years that two servants of Shimei fled to Achish, the son of Maacah, king of Gath. And it was reported to Shimei, with people saying: 'Behold, your servants are in Gath!'
1 Kings 2:40 So Shimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Gath, to Achish, to search for his servants. And he brought them back from Gath.
1 Kings 3:1 Then Solomon made a political and marriage alliance with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh's daughter as his wife and brought her to the City of David to live there until he had finished building his own royal palace, the Temple of the Lord, and the city walls surrounding Jerusalem.
1 Kings 3:2 However, the people were still offering sacrifices in the high places, which were unauthorized altars for worship, because a proper Temple for the Lord had not yet been built in Jerusalem.
1 Kings 3:3 Solomon truly loved the Lord and lived according to the commands of David his father, except for one thing: he also offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, rather than exclusively at the tabernacle.
1 Kings 3:4 Therefore, the king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices there, for it was a particularly prominent high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
1 Kings 3:5 While in Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream during the night, saying: 'Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.'
1 Kings 3:6 Solomon responded: 'You have shown great and enduring mercy to your servant, my father David, just as he lived before You with truth, justice, and an upright heart. And You have continued to show him Your abundant mercy by giving him a son who now sits on his throne, as is evident today.'
1 Kings 3:7 And now, O Lord God, You have made me, Your servant, king in place of my father David. But I am still very young and inexperienced, and I do not know how to properly govern or lead my people.
1 Kings 3:8 And I, Your servant, am placed among Your chosen people—a vast multitude that cannot be counted or numbered because of their sheer size.
1 Kings 3:9 Therefore, grant to Your servant a listening and discerning heart so that I may be able to govern Your people justly and distinguish between good and evil. For who is truly capable of judging this great and numerous people of Yours?
1 Kings 3:10 The Lord was pleased with Solomon's request because he had asked for such a thing—wisdom to govern.
1 Kings 3:11 So the Lord said to Solomon: 'Because you have made this specific request, and have not asked for a long life, nor for riches, nor for the death of your enemies, but instead have asked for wisdom for yourself to render proper judgment and discern what is right: '
1 Kings 3:12 'Behold, I have granted your request. I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so much so that there has been no one like you before, nor will there be anyone like you who arises after you.'
1 Kings 3:13 'Furthermore, even what you did not ask for, I have given to you: great riches and abundant glory. In fact, no king among all those who lived before you will be your equal.'
1 Kings 3:14 'But if you walk in My ways and keep My commands and precepts, just as your father David did, then I will also grant you a long life.'
1 Kings 3:15 So Solomon awoke and realized that it had been a dream. He then returned to Jerusalem, stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to God. He also held a great feast for all his servants.
1 Kings 3:16 At that time, two women who were prostitutes came before the king and stood in his presence.
1 Kings 3:17 One of them said: 'Please, my lord, this woman and I lived together in the same house. I gave birth to a child while she was with me in the room.'
1 Kings 3:18 'And on the third day after I gave birth, she also gave birth. We were alone together; there was no one else in the house with us except the two of us.'
1 Kings 3:19 'But this woman's son died during the night, because she accidentally suffocated him in her sleep.'
1 Kings 3:20 'So she got up in the quiet of the deep night and took my son from my side while I, your handmaid, was asleep, and laid him in her own bosom. Then she put her dead son in my bosom instead.'
1 Kings 3:21 'And when I arose in the morning to nurse my son, he appeared dead. But when I looked at him closely in the daylight, I realized that he was not the son I had given birth to.'
1 Kings 3:22 The other woman replied: 'No, that's not true! Your son is the one who died; my son is alive!' But the first woman insisted: 'You are lying! My son is alive, and your son is dead!' And so they argued back and forth before the king.
1 Kings 3:23 Then the king said: 'This woman claims: "My son is alive, and your son is dead." And the other woman replies: "No, your son is dead, and my son is alive."'
1 Kings 3:24 Then the king added: 'Bring me a sword.' And when a sword was brought before the king,
1 Kings 3:25 he commanded: 'Cut the living child in two, and give half to one woman and half to the other.'
1 Kings 3:26 Then the woman whose son was truly alive, for her heart ached for her child, said to the king: 'Please, my lord, give her the living child, and do not kill him!' But the other woman insisted: 'Let the child be neither mine nor yours; divide him!'
1 Kings 3:27 The king then declared: 'Give the living child to this woman, and do not kill him, for she is truly his mother.'
1 Kings 3:28 So all of Israel heard of the judgment the king had rendered, and they held the king in awe, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.
1 Kings 3:29 So King Solomon was reigning over all of Israel.
1 Kings 3:30 And these were the chief officials he had: Azariah, son of Zadok the priest,
1 Kings 3:31 Elihoreph and Ahiah, sons of Shisha, were the secretaries; Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the chancellor, responsible for royal records.
1 Kings 3:32 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was in command of the army. Zadok and Abiathar served as high priests.
1 Kings 3:33 Azariah, son of Nathan, was in charge of the regional governors who oversaw the tribute collection. Zabud, son of Nathan, was a priest and also the king's close friend and advisor.
1 Kings 3:34 Ahishar was the supervisor of the royal palace, and Adoniram, son of Abda, was in charge of the forced labor and taxation.
1 Kings 3:35 Solomon also had twelve district governors appointed over all of Israel. They were responsible for providing food supplies for the king and his royal household. Each governor was in charge of providing supplies for one month out of the year.
1 Kings 3:36 Their names were: Ben-Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim.
1 Kings 3:37 Ben-Dekar, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, Elon, and Beth-hanan.
1 Kings 3:38 Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth; his region included Socoh and all the land of Hepher.
1 Kings 3:39 Ben-Abinadab, whose district covered all the heights of Dor. He also had Taphath, one of Solomon's daughters, as his wife.
1 Kings 3:40 Baana, son of Ahilud, was in charge of Taanach and Megiddo, and all of Beth-shan, which is near Zarethan, below Jezreel, extending from Beth-shan to Abel-meholah, and even beyond Jokmeam.
1 Kings 3:1 A covenant was made between Solomon and Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Solomon took Pharaoh's daughter in marriage and brought her into the city of David, Jerusalem. This was until he finished building his own royal palace, the Temple of the Lord, and the wall around Jerusalem.
1 Kings 3:2 However, the people were still sacrificing in the local high places. This was because the house dedicated to the Name of the Lord—the Temple—had not yet been built by that day.
1 Kings 3:3 Solomon loved the Lord, walking according to the precepts of David, his father. His only exception was that he would offer sacrifices and burn incense in the high places.
1 Kings 3:4 So the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the greatest of the local high places. Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings upon that altar.
1 Kings 3:5 The Lord appeared to Solomon in Gibeon during a night dream, saying: "Ask for whatever you wish that I may give it to you."
1 Kings 3:6 Solomon said: "You have shown great mercy to your servant David, my father, because he walked before You in truth, and justice, and with an upright heart. And You kept for him Your great mercy, giving him a son who sits upon his throne, even today."
1 Kings 3:7 And now, O Lord, my God, You have made your servant king in place of David my father. But I am a mere child, lacking the experience to lead effectively.
1 Kings 3:8 And your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen—an immense people, so numerous that they cannot be counted or tallied.
1 Kings 3:9 Therefore, give your servant a docile heart, one capable of learning and understanding Your will, so that he may be able to judge Your people and discern between good and evil. For who can truly judge this great people of Yours?
1 Kings 3:10 And the Lord was pleased with what Solomon said, because he had asked for such a thing.
1 Kings 3:11 And the Lord said to Solomon: "Because you have asked for this, and you have not asked for a long life for yourself, nor riches, nor the lives of your enemies, but rather you have asked for wisdom to discern judgment:
1 Kings 3:12 Behold, I have done for you according to your words. I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so much so that there has been no one like you before you, nor shall anyone like you rise after you.
1 Kings 3:13 But also what you did not ask for, I have given to you: namely, riches and glory. This is so that no one among kings shall be like you in all your days.
1 Kings 3:14 If, however, you walk in My ways and keep My precepts and My commandments, just as David your father walked, I will make your days long.
1 Kings 3:15 So Solomon awoke and understood that it had been a dream. He then came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. He offered burnt offerings and made peace offerings, and then gave a feast for all his servants.
1 Kings 3:16 Then two women, who were prostitutes, came to the king and stood before him.
1 Kings 3:17 One of them said: "Please, my lord, this woman and I lived in one house. I gave birth while she was with me in the bedchamber."
1 Kings 3:18 "On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. We were together, and there was no one else with us in the house except for us two."
1 Kings 3:19 "Now the son of this woman died in the night, for she lay upon him while sleeping."
1 Kings 3:20 "And rising in the deep silence of the night, she took my son from my side, your handmaid, while I was sleeping, and placed him in her bosom. But her own son, who was dead, she placed in my bosom."
1 Kings 3:21 "When I arose in the morning to give milk to my son, he was dead. But when I looked at him more carefully and paid attention, I realized that he was not my son, the one I had given birth to."
1 Kings 3:22 The other woman answered: "It is not as you say; rather, your son is dead, and mine lives." And the first woman countered: "You lie! My son lives, and your son is dead." And so they argued before the king.
1 Kings 3:23 And the king said: "This woman says: 'My son lives, and your son is dead.' And that woman answers: 'No, but your son is dead, and my son lives.'"
1 Kings 3:24 Therefore, the king commanded: "Bring me a sword!" And when they had brought a sword before the king,
1 Kings 3:25 He commanded: "Divide the living infant into two parts, and give one part to one woman, and the other part to the other."
1 Kings 3:26 And the woman whose son was alive responded to the king—for her compassion was deeply stirred for her son: "Please, my lord, give her the living infant, and do not kill him!" But the other woman said: "Let him be neither mine nor yours, but let him be divided!"
1 Kings 3:27 The king answered and said: "Give this woman the living infant, and do not kill him. She is his true mother."
1 Kings 3:28 Therefore, all Israel heard the judgment that the king had rendered. And they feared the king, seeing that the wisdom of God was in him to render such judgment.

1 Kings 3:1 Now, when the reign of King Solomon was established and secure, he married the daughter of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. He brought her to live in the City of David until he could complete building his own royal palace, the Temple of the Lord, and the protective wall around Jerusalem.
1 Kings 3:2 However, the people were still offering sacrifices at various high places throughout the land, because a dedicated Temple to the Lord had not yet been built for His name, not even up to that day.
1 Kings 3:3 Solomon loved the Lord and walked according to the commands of David, his father. However, he himself also sacrificed and burned incense at those high places.
1 Kings 3:4 So the king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices there, because that particular place was a great high place for worship. Solomon offered a thousand whole burnt offerings upon that altar.
1 Kings 3:5 While he was at Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream during the night, saying, 'Ask what you desire, and I will give it to you.'
1 Kings 3:6 Solomon answered, 'You have shown great mercy to Your servant David, my father, because he walked before You in truth, in justice, and with a sincere heart. You have also kept Your great mercy for him by giving him a son to sit on his throne, which is as it is this very day.'
1 Kings 3:7 And now, O Lord God, You have made Your servant king in place of David, my father. But I am merely a young man, inexperienced in leadership, and do not know how to carry out my royal duties.
1 Kings 3:8 And Your servant is in the midst of Your chosen people—an immense population that cannot be numbered or counted because of their great multitude.
1 Kings 3:9 Therefore, give to Your servant an understanding and discerning heart, so that I may be able to judge Your people properly and distinguish between good and evil. For who is truly able to judge this immense people of Yours?
1 Kings 3:10 The Lord was pleased with this request, because Solomon had asked for such a thing.
1 Kings 3:11 The Lord said to Solomon, 'Because you have made this request, and have not asked for yourself a long life, nor riches, nor the deaths of your enemies, but instead have asked for wisdom to discern and administer justice—'
1 Kings 3:12 —behold, I have granted your request. I have given you such a wise and understanding heart that there has been no one like you before, nor will there be anyone like you afterward.'
1 Kings 3:13 'Moreover, I have also given you what you did not ask for—namely, riches and glory—to such an extent that no other king will be your equal throughout your entire life.'
1 Kings 3:14 'Furthermore, if you walk in My ways and keep My precepts and My commandments, just as your father David walked, then I will grant you a long life.'
1 Kings 3:15 Then Solomon awoke and understood that it had been a dream. He came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. He offered whole burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings, and then he held a feast for all his servants.
1 Kings 3:16 After these events, two prostitutes came before the king and stood there in his presence.
1 Kings 3:17 One of them said, 'Please, my lord, this woman and I lived in the same house. While we were there, I gave birth to a child with her in the house.'
1 Kings 3:18 Then, on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. We were alone together in the house; there was no one else with us, only the two of us.
1 Kings 3:19 But this woman's son died during the night, because she accidentally overlaid him while she was sleeping.
1 Kings 3:20 Then she rose in the middle of the night, while I, Your handmaid, was sleeping. She took my son from my side and laid him in her own bosom. And her own son, who was already dead, she laid in my bosom instead.
1 Kings 3:21 When I arose in the morning to nurse my son, I found him dead. But when I looked at him closely and carefully, I realized that he was not the son I had given birth to.
1 Kings 3:22 The other woman replied, 'No, that is not true! This living child is my son, and your son is the one who is dead.' But the first woman insisted, 'You are lying! My son is alive, and your son is dead.' And so, they argued back and forth before the king.
1 Kings 3:23 The king then said, 'This woman claims, "My son is alive, and your son is dead." And that woman replies, "No, your son is dead, and my son is alive."'
1 Kings 3:24 The king then added, 'Bring me a sword!' So, they brought a sword into the king’s presence.
1 Kings 3:25 He commanded, 'Cut the living infant in two, and give one half to one woman and the other half to the other.'
1 Kings 3:26 Then the woman whose son was truly alive—for her heart was deeply moved with compassion for her son—spoke to the king, saying, 'Please, my lord, give the living infant to her! Do not kill him!' But the other woman declared, 'Let him be neither mine nor yours. Divide him!'
1 Kings 3:27 Then the king gave the command, saying, 'Give the living infant to this woman, and do not kill him, for she is truly his mother.'
1 Kings 3:28 So all Israel heard the judgment that the king had pronounced, and they stood in awe of the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.
1 Kings 4:1 Therefore, King Solomon was the ruler over all of Israel.
1 Kings 4:2 These were his chief officials: Azariah, the son of Zadok, was the priest.
1 Kings 4:3 Elioreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, were scribes. Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the royal recorder.
1 Kings 4:4 Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was in charge of the army. Zadok and Abiathar were priests.
1 Kings 4:5 Azariah, the son of Nathan, was in charge of those appointed over individual administrative duties. Zabud, the son of Nathan, was a priest and a friend of the king.
1 Kings 4:6 Ahisar was the chief steward of the palace. Adoniram, the son of Abda, was responsible for the forced labor levy.
1 Kings 4:7 Solomon also had twelve district governors over all Israel. They supplied provisions for the king and his household. Each one supplied food for one month of the year.
1 Kings 4:8 And these are their names: Ben-Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim.
1 Kings 4:9 Ben-Dekar, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-Shemesh, Elon, and Beth-Hanan.
1 Kings 4:10 Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth. To him belonged Socoh and all the land of Hepher.
1 Kings 4:11 Ben-Abinadab, whose district was all of Naphath-Dor. He had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter, as his wife.
1 Kings 4:12 Baana, the son of Ahilud, was in Taanach and Megiddo and in all of Beth-Shan which is next to Zarethan, below Jezreel; from Beth-Shan up to Abel-Meholah, opposite Jokmeam.
1 Kings 4:13 Ben-Geber, in Ramoth-Gilead. To him belonged the villages of Jair, the son of Manasseh, in Gilead. Also, the region of Argob which is in Bashan belonged to him; it had sixty large, fortified cities with bronze gates.
1 Kings 4:14 Ahinadab, the son of Iddo, was the governor of Mahanaim.
1 Kings 4:15 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali. He also had Basemath, Solomon’s daughter, as his wife.
1 Kings 4:16 Baana, the son of Hushai, in Asher and Aloth.
1 Kings 4:17 Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, in Issachar.
1 Kings 4:18 Shimei, the son of Elah, in Benjamin.
1 Kings 4:19 Geber, the son of Uri, was in the land of Gilead, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan. He was the sole governor in that region.
1 Kings 4:20 Judah and Israel were countless, like the sand of the sea in multitude. They were eating and drinking and rejoicing.
1 Kings 4:21 Now Solomon held sway over all the kingdoms, from the River Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. They presented gifts to him and served him all the days of his life.
1 Kings 4:22 Solomon’s provisions for each day were thirty cori of fine flour and sixty cori of meal,
1 Kings 4:23 along with ten fattened oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, and one hundred sheep. This was in addition to a multitude of deer, gazelles, wild game, and fattened fowl.
1 Kings 4:24 For he ruled over all the region beyond the River Euphrates, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, and over all the kings of those regions. And he had peace on every side, all around.
1 Kings 4:25 Judah and Israel lived securely, each one under his own vine and under his own fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
1 Kings 4:26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls for chariot horses and twelve thousand cavalry horses.
1 Kings 4:27 Those district governors supplied him with provisions, each one for his month, according to what was appointed for him, so that nothing would be lacking from what was due to the king.
1 Kings 4:28 They also brought barley and straw for the horses and other beasts of burden to the place where the king was, according to what was appointed for them.
1 Kings 4:29 God also gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding, and a breadth of mind like the sand which is on the seashore.
1 Kings 4:30 And Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the Egyptians.
1 Kings 4:31 And he was wiser than all people; wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And he was renowned among all the surrounding nations.
1 Kings 4:32 He also spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five.
1 Kings 4:33 He spoke about trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He also spoke about animals, birds, creeping things, and fish.
1 Kings 4:34 And people came from all nations to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
1 Kings 4:1 Therefore, King Solomon was the king over all the nation of Israel.
1 Kings 4:2 These were the chief officials Solomon had serving him: Azariah, the son of Zadok, was the priest.
1 Kings 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahia, the sons of Shisha, were the royal secretaries. Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was in charge of chronicling the kingdom's history.
1 Kings 4:4 Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, commanded the army. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.
1 Kings 4:5 Azariah, the son of Nathan, was the chief officer over those who governed the twelve tribes. Zabud, the son of Nathan, was a priest and the king's trusted personal advisor.
1 Kings 4:6 Ahisar was in charge of the royal household, overseeing the palace. And Adoniram, the son of Abda, managed the forced labor and taxes.
1 Kings 4:7 Now Solomon had twelve district governors appointed over all of Israel. Their duty was to provide food supplies for the king and his royal household. Each of these officials, in turn, was responsible for the provisions during one month of the year.
1 Kings 4:8 And these were their names: Ben-Hur was the governor in the hill country of Ephraim.
1 Kings 4:9 Ben-Dekar was the governor in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, Elon, and Beth-hanan.
1 Kings 4:10 Ben-Hesed was the governor in Arubboth. He was in charge of Socoh and all the land of Hepher.
1 Kings 4:11 Ben-Abinadab was the governor of all Naphath-Dor. He had as his wife Basemath, Solomon's daughter.
1 Kings 4:12 Baana, the son of Ahilud, was the governor in Taanach and Megiddo, and all of Beth-shean, which is near Zarethan, below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, and across the Jordan River.
1 Kings 4:13 Ben-Geber was the governor in Ramoth-Gilead. He was responsible for the tent villages of Jair, the son of Manasseh, in Gilead. He was also in charge of the region of Argob in Bashan, which contained sixty large, fortified cities with gates secured by bronze bars.
1 Kings 4:14 Ahinadab, the son of Iddo, was the governor in Mahanaim.
1 Kings 4:15 Ahimaaz was the governor in Naphtali. He also married Basemath, Solomon's daughter.
1 Kings 4:16 Baana, the son of Hushai, was the governor in Asher and Aloth.
1 Kings 4:17 Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, was the governor in Issachar.
1 Kings 4:18 Shimei, the son of Elah, was the governor in Benjamin.
1 Kings 4:19 Geber, the son of Uri, was the governor in the land of Gilead, in the territory of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan. He alone was the governor over that consolidated region.
1 Kings 4:20 The people of Judah and Israel were countless, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They were prosperous, eating and drinking, and rejoicing in their safety.
1 Kings 4:21 King Solomon held dominion over all the kingdoms from the great Euphrates River down to the land of the Philistines and as far as the border of Egypt. These nations presented him with gifts and served him throughout his entire life.
1 Kings 4:22 For each day, the food provisions for Solomon's court were thirty measures of fine flour and sixty measures of coarser meal.
1 Kings 4:23 This included ten fattened oxen, twenty oxen from the pastures, and one hundred sheep, not including the vast numbers of deer, gazelles, roebucks, and specially fattened birds that were also consumed.
1 Kings 4:24 Indeed, he held sway over the entire region west of the great Euphrates River, from Tiphsah all the way to Gaza, and over all the kings of those surrounding lands. Thus, he maintained peace on all sides of his dominion.
1 Kings 4:25 Therefore, the people of Judah and Israel lived in great security, each person dwelling peacefully under his own vine and fig tree—a sign of prosperity—from the northern city of Dan all the way to Beersheba in the south, for all of Solomon's days.
1 Kings 4:26 Solomon also had forty thousand stalls for the horses used for his chariots, and he maintained twelve thousand horsemen in his cavalry.
1 Kings 4:27 The aforementioned district governors provided the provisions for King Solomon and for all who ate at his table, each in his own month, ensuring that nothing was lacking.
1 Kings 4:28 They also brought barley and straw for the horses and for the other draft animals to the location where the king was staying, each governor according to his specific assignment.
1 Kings 4:29 Moreover, God granted Solomon immense wisdom and very great understanding, along with an expansive breadth of mind, as vast as the sand on the seashore.
1 Kings 4:30 Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt.
1 Kings 4:31 He was wiser than all other people, even wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Chalkol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. His fame for wisdom spread throughout all the surrounding nations.
1 Kings 4:32 He also uttered three thousand proverbs and composed five thousand songs.
1 Kings 4:33 He spoke extensively about all forms of plant life, from the magnificent cedar of Lebanon to the humble hyssop that grows from a wall. He also discoursed on animals of the land, birds of the air, creeping creatures, and fish of the sea.
1 Kings 4:34 People came from all nations to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and kings from all over the earth sent envoys who had heard of his profound understanding.
1 Kings 4:1 So King Solomon was reigning over all of Israel.
1 Kings 4:2 These were the chief officers he had: Azarias, the son of Sadoc, was the priest.
1 Kings 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahia, the sons of Sisa, were the scribes, responsible for royal records; and Josaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the chancellor, managing state affairs.
1 Kings 4:4 Banaias, the son of Jojada, was in command of the army; and Sadoc and Abiathar were the chief priests.
1 Kings 4:5 Azarias, the son of Nathan, was in charge of all the officers appointed over various duties; and Zabud, the son of Nathan, was a priest and a trusted friend of the king.
1 Kings 4:6 Ahisar was the prefect of the royal palace, managing the household; and Adoniram, the son of Abda, was in charge of collecting all the taxes and tribute.
1 Kings 4:7 Solomon also had twelve officers appointed over all of Israel, whose duty was to provide food supplies for the king and his royal household. Each of these officers would provide the necessary provisions for one month of the year.
1 Kings 4:8 And these were their names and their assigned districts: Benhur was in the mountainous region of Ephraim.
1 Kings 4:9 Bendecar was in Macces, and in Saalabim, and Bethsames, and Elon Bethanan.
1 Kings 4:10 Benhesed was in Aruboth; his district included Socho and all the land of Epher.
1 Kings 4:11 Benabinadab had responsibility for all of Nephath Dor. He also had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter, as his wife.
1 Kings 4:12 Bana, the son of Ahilud, was responsible for Thanac and Mageddo, and all of Bethsan, which is near Sarthana, below Jezrahel, stretching from Bethsan all the way to Abelmehula, opposite Jecmaan.
1 Kings 4:13 Bengaber was in Ramoth Galaad; he also controlled the Avoth Jair, the villages belonging to the sons of Manasse in Galaad. His region was Argob, which is in Basan, consisting of sixty large, walled cities, each with bronze gate-bolts.
1 Kings 4:14 Ahinadab, the son of Addo, was the officer for Maanaim.
1 Kings 4:15 Achimaas was in Nephthali; he, too, had taken Basemath, Solomon’s daughter, as his wife.
1 Kings 4:16 Baana, the son of Husai, was in Aser and Baloth.
1 Kings 4:17 Josaphat, the son of Pharue, was in Issachar.
1 Kings 4:18 Semei, the son of Ela, was in Benjamin.
1 Kings 4:19 Geber, the son of Uri, was in the land of Galaad, which was the territory of Sehon, king of the Amorrhaei, and Og, king of Basan; he was the only officer appointed over that land.
1 Kings 4:20 The people of Juda and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore; they were eating and drinking and living in joy.
1 Kings 4:21 Solomon was reigning over all the kingdoms, holding dominion from the great River (the Euphrates), through the land of the Philistines, and all the way to the border of Egypt. These kingdoms offered him tribute and served him all the days of his life.
1 Kings 4:22 Solomon’s daily provisions were an immense amount: thirty *chori* of fine flour and sixty *chori* of regular flour. (A *chorus* was a large measure, approximately 60 gallons).
1 Kings 4:23 Also, ten fattened oxen, twenty oxen from the pastures, and one hundred rams were provided, in addition to many deer, gazelles, wild oxen, and fattened birds.
1 Kings 4:24 For he ruled over all the region beyond the great River, from Thaphsa all the way to Gaza, and over all the kings of those surrounding regions. He enjoyed peace on every side.
1 Kings 4:25 Throughout all the days of Solomon’s reign, the people of Juda and Israel lived in safety and peace, each person secure under his own vine and fig tree, from the northernmost city of Dan to the southernmost city of Bersabee.
1 Kings 4:26 Solomon also had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand horses for his cavalry.
1 Kings 4:27 The aforementioned officers would each, in their assigned month, provide the food supplies for King Solomon and for all who came to his table, ensuring that nothing was ever lacking.
1 Kings 4:28 They also brought barley and straw for the horses and other draft animals to the place where the king resided, according to their assigned duty.
1 Kings 4:29 God also gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding, and a breadth of mind as vast as the sand on the seashore.
1 Kings 4:30 Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of the Egyptians.
1 Kings 4:31 Indeed, he was wiser than all other men; he was wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalchol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. His fame for wisdom spread throughout all the surrounding nations.
1 Kings 4:32 He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered five thousand.
1 Kings 4:33 He discoursed about all kinds of plant life, from the magnificent cedar that grows in Libanus down to the humble hyssop that sprouts from a wall. He also spoke extensively about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.
1 Kings 4:34 So people came from all nations to hear Solomon’s wisdom, and from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
1 Kings 5:1 Hiram, King of Tyre, sent his servants to King Solomon after hearing that Solomon had been anointed king in place of his father, King David. This was because Hiram had always been a loyal friend to David.
1 Kings 5:2 Solomon then sent a message to Hiram, saying:
1 Kings 5:3 You know that my father David wanted to build a Temple for the Lord his God, but he could not because of the wars that surrounded him. God prevented him until the Lord made all his enemies subject to him.
1 Kings 5:4 But now the Lord my God has given me peace on all sides; there is no adversary, and no evil threatens my kingdom.
1 Kings 5:5 Therefore, I intend to build a Temple for the Lord my God, just as the Lord spoke to my father David, saying: ‘Your son, whom I will place on your throne in your stead, he shall build a house for my Name.’
1 Kings 5:6 Therefore, command your workers to cut down cedar trees from Lebanon for me. My workers will join your workers, and I will pay you whatever wages you determine for your workers. For you know that there is no one among my people who can cut timber as skillfully as the Sidonians and Tyrians.
1 Kings 5:7 When Hiram heard Solomon’s message, he rejoiced greatly and said: 'Blessed be the Lord today, who has given David a most wise son to rule over this great people!'
1 Kings 5:8 Hiram then sent this message back to Solomon: 'I have heard what you commanded me. I will fulfill all your wishes concerning cedar timber and fir timber.'
1 Kings 5:9 My workers will bring the timber down from Lebanon to the sea. I will then bind them into rafts on the sea and transport them to whatever location you specify. There I will unload them, and you may take them. My only condition is that you provide provisions for my household in return.
1 Kings 5:10 Therefore, Hiram provided King Solomon with cedar timber and fir timber, supplying everything Solomon desired.
1 Kings 5:11 In return, Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat to feed his household, and twenty thousand measures of pure olive oil. Solomon supplied these to Hiram every single year.
1 Kings 5:12 The Lord also gave wisdom to Solomon, just as He had promised him. There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two kings made a formal treaty together.
1 Kings 5:13 King Solomon drafted workers from all of Israel; this forced labor amounted to thirty thousand men.
1 Kings 5:14 He sent them to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand men each month. This meant they would work one month in Lebanon and then be at home for two months. Adoniram was in charge of this forced labor.
1 Kings 5:15 Solomon also had seventy thousand men who carried burdens and eighty thousand stonecutters working in the mountains.
1 Kings 5:16 This was in addition to the three thousand three hundred overseers whom Solomon had appointed over the work. These overseers were in charge of the workers and supervised the preparations for the construction.
1 Kings 5:17 The king also commanded them to bring large, carefully selected stones for the Temple’s foundation and to prepare them by squaring them.
1 Kings 5:18 The stonecutters of Solomon and Hiram, along with the Giblites, quarried and shaped these stones. They prepared both the timber and the stones for the construction of the Temple.
1 Kings 5:1 And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent his servants to King Solomon, because Hiram had heard that they had anointed Solomon as king in his father's place. Hiram had been King David's friend throughout his life.
1 Kings 5:2 Solomon, in turn, sent a message to Hiram, saying:
1 Kings 5:3 You know the desire of my father, David, and how he was unable to build a temple dedicated to the Name of the Lord his God. This was because of the wars that surrounded him, until the Lord completely subdued his enemies.
1 Kings 5:4 But now the Lord my God has given me peace on every side. There is no adversary, and there are no threats of harm.
1 Kings 5:5 Therefore, I intend to build a temple dedicated to the Name of the Lord my God, just as the Lord spoke to my father, David, saying: 'Your son, whom I will establish on your throne in your place, will himself build a temple dedicated to My Name.'
1 Kings 5:6 So then, command your people to cut down cedar trees from Lebanon for me. My servants will work alongside your servants, and I will pay your servants whatever wages you determine. For you know that there is no one among my people who is skilled at cutting timber as well as the Sidonians are.
1 Kings 5:7 When Hiram heard Solomon's words, he was overjoyed and exclaimed, 'Blessed be the Lord today, who has given David such a wise son to rule over this great people!'
1 Kings 5:8 Then Hiram sent word back to Solomon, saying: 'I have heard what you requested of me. I will fulfill all your desires regarding the cedar and fir timbers.'
1 Kings 5:9 My servants will bring the timbers down from Lebanon to the sea. Then I will bind them into rafts on the sea and tow them to the location you specify for me. There, I will have them disassembled, and you can take them. In return, you will provide food supplies for my royal household.
1 Kings 5:10 So Hiram supplied Solomon with cedar timbers and fir timbers, just as he had desired.
1 Kings 5:11 Solomon, in turn, gave Hiram twenty thousand *cori* (an ancient unit of measure) of wheat as provisions for his royal household, and twenty thousand *cori* of the purest olive oil. Solomon gave these provisions to Hiram each and every year.
1 Kings 5:12 The Lord also granted Solomon wisdom, just as He had promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two kings made a formal treaty together.
1 Kings 5:13 Then King Solomon raised a forced labor levy from all of Israel, and this levy consisted of thirty thousand men.
1 Kings 5:14 He sent these men to Lebanon, ten thousand each month in rotation. This arrangement meant that for two months they were in their own homes, and then for the third month, they were in Lebanon. Adoniram was the overseer of this forced labor levy.
1 Kings 5:15 Solomon also had seventy thousand men who carried heavy loads and eighty thousand stonecutters working in the hill country.
1 Kings 5:16 This was in addition to the two hundred and fifty chief overseers who were in charge of each of Solomon's work crews. These overseers pressed the people and ensured the work progressed quickly.
1 Kings 5:17 The king commanded them to quarry large, choice stones, and to prepare them as squared stones, for the foundation of the temple.
1 Kings 5:18 And so, Solomon's skilled workers, along with Hiram's skilled workers and the Giblites, hewed and prepared the timbers and stones, all in readiness for the building of the temple.
1 Kings 6:1 Now it happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel departed from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziph—which is the second month of the year—that he began to build the House for the Lord.
1 Kings 6:2 The House that King Solomon was building for the Lord had a length of sixty cubits, a width of twenty cubits, and a height of thirty cubits.
1 Kings 6:3 And there was a portico in front of the Temple, twenty cubits long—matching the width of the House—and ten cubits wide, extending out from the front of the House.
1 Kings 6:4 And he made narrow, recessed windows in the Temple.
1 Kings 6:5 And he built side chambers—or stories—around the outer walls of the House, making ledges all around.
1 Kings 6:6 The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle one six cubits wide, and the third story seven cubits wide; for indeed, the outer wall of the House was recessed all around, so that the supporting beams would not have to be fastened into the walls of the House itself.
1 Kings 6:7 And when the House was being built, it was constructed from carefully cut and perfectly finished stones; so that no sound of hammer, axe, or any iron tool was heard in the House while it was being built.
1 Kings 6:8 The entrance to the lowest side chamber was on the right side of the House, and a winding staircase led up to the middle story, and from the middle story up to the third.
1 Kings 6:9 And he built the House, and he finished it; and he covered the House with ceilings—constructed of cedar planks.
1 Kings 6:10 And he built the stories around the entire House, each five cubits high; and he joined the House with cedar planks for these stories.
1 Kings 6:11 Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying:
1 Kings 6:12 Concerning this House that you are building: if you walk in my precepts, and carry out my judgments, and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will confirm my word to you, which I spoke to David your father.
1 Kings 6:13 And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I will not forsake my people Israel.
1 Kings 6:14 Therefore, Solomon built the House, and he finished it.
1 Kings 6:15 And he built the inner walls of the House with cedar planks, from the floor of the House up to the ceilings, paneling the interior with wood; and he laid the floor of the House with planks of fir wood.
1 Kings 6:16 And at the rear of the House, he built a partition of cedar planks twenty cubits high from the floor to the ceiling; and he made within it the Inner Sanctuary, that is, the Holy of Holies.
1 Kings 6:17 The main part of the House—that is, the Temple proper before the Inner Sanctuary—was fifty cubits long.
1 Kings 6:18 And all the interior of the entire House was covered with cedar planks, decorated with carvings and engravings, with twisted designs and various patterns, both raised and flat.
1 Kings 6:19 And he prepared the Inner Sanctuary in the middle of the House’s interior, to place there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord.
1 Kings 6:20 Furthermore, the Inner Sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high; and he covered it with pure gold; and he placed an altar before the Inner Sanctuary and covered it with gold.
1 Kings 6:21 And Solomon covered the interior of the House with pure gold, and he placed gold chains before the Inner Sanctuary, and he covered it—the Inner Sanctuary—with gold.
1 Kings 6:22 And there was nothing in the entire House that was not covered with gold; even the whole altar of the Inner Sanctuary he covered with gold.
1 Kings 6:23 And in the Inner Sanctuary, he made two cherubim—angelic figures—of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
1 Kings 6:24 One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing of the cherub was five cubits long; that is, it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing.
1 Kings 6:25 Likewise, the second cherub also had ten cubits in wing span; the measurement was equal, and the craftsmanship was equal for both cherubim.
1 Kings 6:26 One cherub had a height of ten cubits, and likewise the other cherub.
1 Kings 6:27 And he placed the two cherubim in the middle of the inner Temple; and the cherubim spread out their wings, so that one wing touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their remaining wings touched each other in the middle of the Temple.
1 Kings 6:28 He also covered the cherubim completely with gold.
1 Kings 6:29 And he carved all the walls of the House all around with various engravings and lathe work, both inside and outside; and he made cherubim, and palm trees, and various sculptured designs, appearing as if raised from the walls.
1 Kings 6:30 And he also covered the floor of the House with gold, both inside and outside.
1 Kings 6:31 And for the entrance of the Inner Sanctuary, he made doors of olive wood; and the doorposts and side panels formed five-sided frames.
1 Kings 6:32 And there were two doors of olive wood; and he engraved and carved on them cherubim, and palm trees, and very prominent decorative figures; and he covered everything with gold, both the cherubim and the palm trees.
1 Kings 6:33 And for the entrance of the main Temple area, he made doorposts of olive wood, having four distinct angles.
1 Kings 6:34 And there were two doors made of fir wood, carved and engraved, which opened—and the two sides of their hinges folded back.
1 Kings 6:35 And he engraved on them cherubim, and palm trees, and very prominent engravings; and he covered everything with gold sheets.
1 Kings 6:36 And he built the inner court with three courses of polished stones and one course of cedar beams.
1 Kings 6:37 In the fourth year, in the month of Ziph, the House of the Lord was founded.
1 Kings 6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul—which is the eighth month—the House was finished in all its work, and in all that pertained to it; and he built it in seven years.
1 Kings 6:1 It happened then, four hundred and eighty years after the children of Israel left the land of Egypt—specifically in the second month, which is called Ziph—and in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel: Solomon began to build the Temple of the Lord.
1 Kings 6:2 The Temple that King Solomon built for the Lord had a length of sixty cubits, a width of twenty cubits, and a height of thirty cubits.
1 Kings 6:3 The entrance porch in front of the main Temple structure was twenty cubits long, matching the width of the Temple itself. This porch extended ten cubits out from the Temple’s main front wall.
1 Kings 6:4 And for the Temple, he made windows with recessed frames.
1 Kings 6:5 He also built side chambers against the walls of the Temple, all around the structure. These side chambers extended around the outer walls of both the main sanctuary and the inner Holy of Holies. He structured these rooms in a circular arrangement.
1 Kings 6:6 The lowest story of these side chambers was five cubits wide. The middle story was six cubits wide, and the third story was seven cubits wide. This widening allowed for a set of stairs to be placed along the outside of the Temple structure. This design ensured that the supporting beams for the side chambers did not need to be inserted into the walls of the main Temple itself.
1 Kings 6:7 When the Temple was being built, it was constructed from stones that had been completely cut and prepared at the quarry. No hammer, ax, or any other iron tool was heard on the site while the Temple was under construction.
1 Kings 6:8 The entrance to the middle side chamber was on the right side of the Temple. People would ascend by a winding staircase to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third story.
1 Kings 6:9 So Solomon built the Temple and completed its construction. He covered the Temple with ceiling panels made from cedar planks.
1 Kings 6:10 He also built the side chambers all around the Temple structure, each five cubits high, and he covered the Temple’s exterior with cedar wood.
1 Kings 6:11 Then the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying:
1 Kings 6:12 “Concerning this Temple that you are building: if you walk in My commandments, and execute My judgments, and keep all My precepts by walking in them, then I will fulfill My promise to you, which I spoke to David your father.
1 Kings 6:13 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and I will not forsake My people Israel.”
1 Kings 6:14 So Solomon continued to build the Temple, and he completed it.
1 Kings 6:15 Inside the Temple, he built the walls with cedar planks, from the floor of the Temple up to the ceiling. He covered the interior with wood and laid the floor of the Temple with cypress planks.
1 Kings 6:16 And for twenty cubits at the back part of the Temple, he built a partition with cedar planks, from the floor all the way up. This created the inner sanctuary, which is the Holy of Holies, as an inner space within the Temple of the Lord.
1 Kings 6:17 The main sanctuary in front of the Holy of Holies measured forty cubits in length.
1 Kings 6:18 The entire interior of the Temple was cedar, carved with intricate designs and ornamental flower buds. No stone was visible at all; everything was covered with wood.
1 Kings 6:19 And he prepared the Holy of Holies in the innermost part of the Temple, so that the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord could be placed there.
1 Kings 6:20 The Holy of Holies itself was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He covered it with pure gold plates, and he placed an altar in front of this inner sanctuary.
1 Kings 6:21 Solomon covered the entire interior of the Temple with the purest gold. He hung gold chains across the front of the Holy of Holies and also covered it with gold.
1 Kings 6:22 There was nothing in the Temple that was not covered with gold; even the entire altar belonging to the Holy of Holies he covered with gold.
1 Kings 6:23 And in the Holy of Holies, he made two cherubim from olive wood, each ten cubits high.
1 Kings 6:24 One wing of a cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing of the cherub was also five cubits long. This means that from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing, each cherub measured ten cubits across.
1 Kings 6:25 The other cherub also was ten cubits high; its measurements were the same, and the craftsmanship for both cherubim was identical.
1 Kings 6:26 That is to say, each cherub measured ten cubits in height.
1 Kings 6:27 And he placed the two cherubim in the middle of the inner Temple, which is the Holy of Holies. The cherubim spread out their wings, so that one wing of the first cherub touched one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the opposite wall. Their other two wings met in the middle of the Holy of Holies, joining one another.
1 Kings 6:28 He also covered the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings 6:29 And all the walls of the Temple around its perimeter, both within and without, he decorated. He carved various designs and sculptures upon them, including cherubim, palm trees, and ornate open flower carvings, all around.
1 Kings 6:30 He also covered the floor of the Temple with gold, both inside the inner sanctuary and in the outer sanctuary.
1 Kings 6:31 And for the entrance to the Holy of Holies, he made doors from olive wood, with doorposts and doorframes forming five distinct angles.
1 Kings 6:32 These two olive wood doors were carved with cherubim, palm trees, and carved open flower designs. He covered all of them with gold—both the cherubim and the palm trees and the other carvings.
1 Kings 6:33 And for the entrance to the main Temple sanctuary, he made doorposts of olive wood, shaped into a four-angled frame.
1 Kings 6:34 And there were two doors of cypress wood, each consisting of two folding panels that could swing open or fold back.
1 Kings 6:35 And he carved cherubim, palm trees, and intricate flower designs on these doors. He covered all of them entirely with gold plates.
1 Kings 6:36 He also built the inner courtyard with three courses of finely cut stones and one course of cedar beams.
1 Kings 6:37 In the fourth year, in the month of Ziph, the foundation of the Temple of the Lord was laid.
1 Kings 6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul—which is the eighth month—the Temple was completely finished in all its work and in all its preparation. Solomon built it in seven years.
1 Kings 6:1 Now it was in the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel had departed from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziph (which is the second month of the year), that King Solomon began to build the sacred dwelling for the Lord.
1 Kings 6:2 The sacred dwelling that King Solomon was building for the Lord was sixty cubits (approximately 18 inches or 45 centimeters per cubit) in length, twenty cubits in width, and thirty cubits in height.
1 Kings 6:3 And the porch in front of the Temple building was twenty cubits long, matching the width of the Temple building itself, and it extended ten cubits in width in front of the main façade of the Temple.
1 Kings 6:4 And King Solomon made windows with latticework within the Temple building.
1 Kings 6:5 And he built side chambers surrounding the wall of the Temple, against the walls of the sacred dwelling all around, both for the main sanctuary and for the inner oracle, creating additional structures along the perimeter.
1 Kings 6:6 The lowest side chamber was five cubits wide, the middle one six cubits wide, and the third seven cubits wide. This was because he had made ledges on the outside wall of the sacred dwelling all around, so that the supporting beams would not have to be fastened into the Temple walls themselves.
1 Kings 6:7 And when the sacred dwelling was being built, the stones were brought to the site already hewn and perfectly shaped. No hammer, no axe, and no iron tool of any kind was heard at the building site while the Temple was being constructed.
1 Kings 6:8 The entrance to the middle side chamber was on the right side of the sacred dwelling, and a winding staircase led up to the middle chamber, and from the middle chamber up to the third.
1 Kings 6:9 So King Solomon built the sacred dwelling and brought it to completion. He then covered the roof of the sacred dwelling with ceiling beams and boards made of cedar wood.
1 Kings 6:10 And he built the entire upper story, which was five cubits in height, connecting it to the main structure with cedar planks.
1 Kings 6:11 Then the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying:
1 Kings 6:12 “Regarding this sacred dwelling that you are building: if you walk in My precepts, and you execute My judgments, and you keep all My commandments by walking in them, then I will establish My promise with you, which I spoke to David your father.
1 Kings 6:13 And I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel, and I will not forsake My people, Israel.”
1 Kings 6:14 Therefore, Solomon continued to build the sacred dwelling, and he brought it to completion.
1 Kings 6:15 And he built the inner walls of the sacred dwelling with cedar planks, from the floor of the dwelling up to the upper parts of the roof; he covered the interior with wood and laid the floor of the sacred dwelling with planks of fir wood.
1 Kings 6:16 And he built twenty cubits from the back part of the Temple building with cedar planks, from the floor up to the top, and he made an inner sanctuary there, which is to say, the Holy of Holies.
1 Kings 6:17 And the main hall of the Temple, in front of the inner oracle, was forty cubits long.
1 Kings 6:18 And the entire interior of the sacred dwelling was covered with cedar planks, having carved mouldings and various projecting sculptures; there was absolutely nothing inside but cedar wood.
1 Kings 6:19 And he prepared the inner oracle in the middle of the sacred dwelling, in its interior part, so that he might place there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
1 Kings 6:20 Furthermore, the inner oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in height. He covered it with pure gold, and he fashioned an altar from cedar planks.
1 Kings 6:21 And Solomon overlaid the sacred dwelling's interior with pure gold. He placed golden panels all around the sanctuary and prepared a golden veil.
1 Kings 6:22 And he covered the entire altar of the inner oracle with pure gold; and he overlaid the whole sacred dwelling with gold until all was completed. Indeed, he also covered the altar of the oracle with gold.
1 Kings 6:23 And in the inner oracle, he made two cherubim from olive wood, each ten cubits in height.
1 Kings 6:24 One wing of a cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing of the cherub was five cubits long; that is, it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing.
1 Kings 6:25 The second cherub was also ten cubits long. Both cherubim had the same measurement and the same workmanship.
1 Kings 6:26 The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and similarly, the other cherub also had a height of ten cubits.
1 Kings 6:27 And he placed the two cherubim in the middle of the inner Temple sanctuary. The cherubim spread out their wings, and one wing of a cherub touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their other two wings met each other in the middle of the Temple.
1 Kings 6:28 And he also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1 Kings 6:29 And all the walls of the sacred dwelling, all around, he carved with various engravings and carvings, making cherubim, and palm trees, and he carved various pictures, as if projecting from the wall and extending beyond it.
1 Kings 6:30 Moreover, he covered the floor of the sacred dwelling with gold, both inside and outside.
1 Kings 6:31 And for the entrance to the inner oracle, he made doors of olive wood, with doorposts and doorframes forming five angles.
1 Kings 6:32 And the two doors were made of olive wood. On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and greatly projecting images. He covered all of these with gold, overlaying both the cherubim and the palm trees with gold.
1 Kings 6:33 And for the entrance to the main Temple hall, he made doorposts of olive wood, shaped squarely.
1 Kings 6:34 And there were two doors of fir wood; each door was double, and they folded back upon each other.
1 Kings 6:35 And he carved on them cherubim, and palm trees, and many carvings that seemed to project outward. And he covered all of these with gold.
1 Kings 6:36 And he built the inner court with three courses of hewn stones and one course of cedar timbers.
1 Kings 6:37 In the fourth year, the foundation of the sacred dwelling for the Lord was laid, in the month of Ziph.
1 Kings 6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul (which is the eighth month of the year), the sacred dwelling was finished in all its work and in all its construction. So Solomon built it in seven years.
1 Kings 6:39 I did not enclose the entire sacred dwelling with the side structures' paneling.
1 Kings 6:40 And the exterior of the sacred dwelling, and its interior, and the ceilings, and all the woodwork, were made of cedar wood.
1 Kings 7:1 Now, Solomon built his own royal palace for thirteen years, until he completed all the buildings in his complex.
1 Kings 7:2 He also built a palace known as 'the House of the Forest of Lebanon.' It was one hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. This structure had four rows of cedar columns, supporting cedar beams for the ceiling above the columns.
1 Kings 7:3 The colonnade was made of cedar columns, supporting thirty cedar beams above them. These beams were precisely fitted to the columns, and the capitals of the columns were adorned with carvings all around.
1 Kings 7:4 There were dining hall windows arranged in three rows all around. Above these, there were additional sets of windows, also in three layers.
1 Kings 7:5 All the doorways, windows, and doorframes were designed with square frames, each matching the other, arranged in three consistent rows.
1 Kings 7:6 He also built a colonnade, fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide, formed by columns. There was a second portico in front of this larger one, complete with its own columns and supporting architraves placed upon them.
1 Kings 7:7 He made a throne room for judgment, where he would sit to pass decrees, known as 'the Portico of Judgment.' This entire room, from the floor to the ceiling, was covered all around with cedar paneling.
1 Kings 7:8 Solomon's own dwelling, where he lived, was constructed with a different design, set outside this judgment portico. It was similar in style to the House of the Forest of Lebanon. He also built a palace of the same craftsmanship for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married.
1 Kings 7:9 All these structures were built using expensive, precisely cut stones, sawn with a saw, both on their interior and exterior faces. These stones extended from the foundation up to the roof-level, and on the outside, they reached all the way to the great courtyard.
1 Kings 7:10 The foundations themselves were laid with costly, large stones: some were eighteen cubits, and others were twelve cubits in size.
1 Kings 7:11 Above these large foundation stones, there were more costly stones, precisely cut to measure, along with cedar timbers.
1 Kings 7:12 The great courtyard all around was constructed with three rows of cut stones and one row of cedar wood. The inner courtyard of the Lord's Temple and the portico of the Temple were built similarly.
1 Kings 7:13 So King Solomon sent for and brought Hiram from Tyre.
1 Kings 7:14 Hiram was the son of a widowed woman from the tribe of Naphtali, but his father was a man from Tyre, a skilled bronze-worker. Hiram possessed exceptional knowledge for executing every kind of bronze work. When he arrived before King Solomon, he carried out all the work entrusted to him.
1 Kings 7:15 He cast two columns out of bronze. Each column was eighteen cubits in height, and the circumference of each column was twelve cubits, measured around it.
1 Kings 7:16 He also made two bronze capitals, cast in a mold, to be placed on the tops of the columns. Each capital was five cubits high.
1 Kings 7:17 On the capitals, which were on top of the columns, he crafted decorations resembling netting and intertwined chains. There were seven such ornate layers on one capital and seven layers on the other capital.
1 Kings 7:18 He finished the columns, designing two rows of pomegranates all around on one capital, concealing them within the netting that was above the column tops. Similarly, one hundred pomegranates were arranged in two rows all around the other capital.
1 Kings 7:19 The capitals on top of the columns, in the portico, were shaped like polished lilies, extending for four cubits.
1 Kings 7:20 Again, there were other capitals on the two columns, extending around above the netting. Two hundred pomegranates were arranged in rows all around the second capital.
1 Kings 7:21 He set up these columns in the portico of the Temple. He erected the right-hand column and named it 'Jachin.' In the same way, he erected the left-hand column and named it 'Boaz.'
1 Kings 7:22 On top of the columns, there was a decorative design resembling lilies. This completed the work on the columns.
1 Kings 7:23 He also made the great bronze basin, referred to as 'the Sea.' It measured ten cubits from rim to rim, perfectly round in its circumference. It was five cubits high, and a measuring line of thirty cubits could encircle its entire perimeter.
1 Kings 7:24 Under its rim, there were sculpted decorations encircling it, ten sections per cubit, appearing as if two rows of carvings had been cast as one piece.
1 Kings 7:25 The basin stood upon twelve bronze oxen. Three of them faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The great basin rested upon them from above, with the rear parts of the oxen facing inward.
1 Kings 7:26 The thickness of the bronze basin was four fingers. Its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup, or like a spreading lily petal. It had a capacity of two thousand baths.
1 Kings 7:27 He also made ten bronze stands. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
1 Kings 7:28 Between the panels on the stands, there were sculpted figures of lions, oxen, and cherubim. Similar decorations were also placed on the sections above and below these figures.
1 Kings 7:29 Beneath the feet of each stand were four wheels, and their axles were made of bronze. On all four sides, there were shoulder-like supports, cast in bronze, positioned opposite each other beneath the rim.
1 Kings 7:30 The four sides of each stand were adorned with wave-like carvings and hand-like sculptures all around.
1 Kings 7:31 The opening for the basin in the middle, at the top, was one cubit. All around the opening, there were engraved connections. The work was square, not round, measuring one and a half cubits in width.
1 Kings 7:32 And there were four wheels on each side, positioned beneath the connecting structures. The height of each wheel was one and a half cubits.
1 Kings 7:33 The wheels were similar to chariot wheels; their axles, spokes, felloes, and hubs, were all cast in bronze.
1 Kings 7:34 There were four shoulder-like supports on each stand, extending downwards. They were cast in bronze and positioned opposite each other.
1 Kings 7:35 At the very top of each stand, there was a round feature, one and a half cubits in circumference, with carvings on each small column and on its square panels.
1 Kings 7:36 He carved lions, oxen, and cherubim onto the panels and square surfaces. On the hinges, there were also sculpted decorative additions.
1 Kings 7:37 In this manner, he made ten stands. All of them had the same casting, the same measurements, and the same carvings.
1 Kings 7:38 He also made ten bronze basins. Each basin had a capacity of forty baths, and each basin measured four cubits. One basin was placed upon each of the stands.
1 Kings 7:39 He placed the ten stands, five on the right side of the Temple and five on the left. The great bronze basin, the Sea, he placed on the right side of the Temple, towards the southeast.
1 Kings 7:40 Furthermore, Hiram made the pots, shovels, and bowls. He completed all the work for King Solomon in the House of the Lord.
1 Kings 7:1 But Solomon built his own royal palace, a large complex, over the course of thirteen years, and he finally finished all the construction of it.
1 Kings 7:2 He also built a palace structure known as 'the House of the Forest of Lebanon'—a massive building one hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. It was supported by four rows of wooden columns, for all the timber was cedar.
1 Kings 7:3 A cedar roof was built above this structure, extending over the porticos, supported by thirty-five columns. Each of these columns was perfectly aligned in its proper order.
1 Kings 7:4 There was also a specific portico with thirty columns, and upon these columns rested heavy cedar beams.
1 Kings 7:5 All the doors and windows, and every single doorpost, were perfectly square in their design, and each was spaced evenly and symmetrically.
1 Kings 7:6 He then constructed a portico of columns fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. Directly in front of it, he built another portico, also with timber and columns, and a vestibule leading to it.
1 Kings 7:7 He also built the 'Portico of the Throne,' where he would sit to pronounce judgments, naming it the 'Portico of Judgment.' This entire space was paneled throughout with cedar wood, from the floor all the way up to the roof rafters.
1 Kings 7:8 His personal residence, where he lived, was of a different architectural style, located beyond this portico, similar in construction to the House of the Forest of Lebanon. He also built a similar palace, with the same craftsmanship, for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married.
1 Kings 7:9 All these structures were built with expensive, sawed stone blocks, both inside and out, from the foundations all the way up to the roof; this extended outward to the great courtyard.
1 Kings 7:10 The very foundations were made of precious, large stone blocks—some ten cubits long, and others eight cubits long.
1 Kings 7:11 Above these foundation stones were more precious stones, precisely cut to measure, interspersed with cedar wood.
1 Kings 7:12 The great courtyard surrounding these buildings had three courses of hewn stones, topped by one course of cedar beams. The inner courtyard of the Lord's Temple and the temple porch also followed this same construction pattern.
1 Kings 7:13 So King Solomon sent for Hiram from Tyre.
1 Kings 7:14 Hiram was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, but his father was a Tyrian, a skilled bronze worker. Hiram was filled with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge for all kinds of bronze work. When he arrived before King Solomon, he undertook and completed all the work assigned to him.
1 Kings 7:15 He cast two columns out of bronze, each one eighteen cubits high. A circumference of twelve cubits encircled each of them.
1 Kings 7:16 He also cast two capitals out of bronze, to be placed on top of the columns; each capital was five cubits high.
1 Kings 7:17 Each capital for the columns was intricately adorned with bronze lattice-work, and chain-work wonderfully connected, and sculpted lily designs.
1 Kings 7:18 He crafted two rows of pomegranates encircling each lattice-work, designed to cover the capitals that were on the top of the columns. He did the same for the second capital.
1 Kings 7:19 The capitals that were placed on the tops of the columns were shaped like lilies, a work of art, measuring four cubits high in the portico area.
1 Kings 7:20 There were additional capitals above each column, around the lattice-work, with two hundred pomegranates arranged in two rows all around. He made the second capital in the very same manner.
1 Kings 7:21 Then he erected the columns in the portico of the Temple. When he had set up the right-hand column, he named it Jachin. Likewise, when he set up the left-hand column, he named it Boaz.
1 Kings 7:22 The tops of the columns were adorned with capitals shaped like lilies. With this, the work of the columns was completed.
1 Kings 7:23 He also cast a large bronze basin, which was called 'the Sea.' It measured ten cubits from rim to rim, perfectly round in its circumference, and five cubits in height. A measuring cord of thirty cubits could encompass its entire circumference.
1 Kings 7:24 Below its rim, all around the circumference, there were decorations resembling gourds, and other various sculptures, carved in bronze. There were two rows of these cast decorations, extending ten cubits around the entire basin.
1 Kings 7:25 This great basin stood upon twelve bronze oxen. Three of these oxen faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The basin itself rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were turned inward, hidden beneath the basin.
1 Kings 7:26 The thickness of the basin's bronze wall was three fingers wide. Its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup or a blossoming lily petal. It was capable of holding two thousand baths of water.
1 Kings 7:27 He then constructed ten bronze stands for the washing basins, each four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
1 Kings 7:28 The structure of these stands was intricately paneled with engraved designs, and between the joints were panels depicting various figures.
1 Kings 7:29 On the panels, between the upper and lower borders, were sculpted lions, oxen, and cherubim. Above and below these joints, near the base, and beneath the lions and oxen, were more cast bronze figures, hanging like decorative armor plates.
1 Kings 7:30 Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles. There were also extensions like arms cast beneath the four corners of each stand, designed to support the washing basin. These extensions were cast as a single piece with the stands, facing each other in pairs.
1 Kings 7:31 The opening for the washing basin, on the top, extended one cubit inward. Around this opening, another cubit was decorated with carvings and figures. All these parts were square, not round, around their circumference.
1 Kings 7:32 Furthermore, there were four wheels at the lower part of the stands, and their axles were part of the stands themselves. The height of each wheel was one and a half cubits.
1 Kings 7:33 The wheel assembly was like that of a chariot, and all parts, individually, were made of cast bronze.
1 Kings 7:34 And at each of the four corners of every stand, there were four shoulder-like projections, cast as part of the base itself.
1 Kings 7:35 At the very top of each stand, there was a round platform, six cubits in circumference, with interwoven designs and sculptures, all cast as part of the stand.
1 Kings 7:36 On the panels of the stands and on their joints, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, depicting them in high relief. Around the edges, he added decorative borders.
1 Kings 7:37 In this manner, he made all ten stands; they were all of the same casting, the same measurements, and the same sculpted designs.
1 Kings 7:38 He also made ten bronze washing basins, each holding forty baths of water. Each basin was four cubits high and was designed to sit on one of the ten stands.
1 Kings 7:39 He placed five of the stands on the right side of the Temple and five on the left side. The great bronze basin, 'the Sea,' he placed on the right side of the Temple, facing eastward, towards the south.
1 Kings 7:40 So Hiram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. He thus completed all the work for King Solomon concerning the house of the Lord.
1 Kings 8:1 Then Solomon gathered all the chief men of Israel, and all the leaders of the tribes, and the heads of the family lines of the sons of Israel to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the City of David—also known as Zion.
1 Kings 8:2 All the men of Israel gathered together to King Solomon in the month of Ethanim, for the Feast—which is the seventh month.
1 Kings 8:3 All the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the Ark.
1 Kings 8:4 and the Tent of Meeting—and all the sacred vessels that were kept in the Tent. The priests and Levites carried these items.
1 Kings 8:5 King Solomon and all the multitude of Israel who had gathered to him, in the presence of the Ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen without number or estimation, because there were so many.
1 Kings 8:6 Then the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its proper place, into the innermost sanctuary of the Temple, into the Holy of Holies, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
1 Kings 8:7 Indeed, the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the Ark, protecting the Ark and its carrying poles from above.
1 Kings 8:8 When the carrying poles were extended, their ends were visible outside the innermost sanctuary, in front of the entrance to the Holy of Holies, but they were not visible from outside the sanctuary itself. They have remained there until the present day.
1 Kings 8:9 There was nothing in the Ark except for the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Horeb, when the Lord gave the law to the sons of Israel after they had come out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings 8:10 Now it happened that when the priests came out of the Sanctuary, a cloud filled the house of the Lord.
1 Kings 8:11 The priests could not stand there and minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.
1 Kings 8:12 Then Solomon said: “The Lord said He would dwell in the cloud.
1 Kings 8:13 Building, I have built a house as Your dwelling place—a very firm throne for You forever.”
1 Kings 8:14 The king then turned his face and blessed the entire assembly of Israel, for the whole assembly of Israel was standing.
1 Kings 8:15 And he said: “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spoke with His own mouth to my father David, and has fulfilled with His own hands what He said, saying:
1 Kings 8:16 ‘From the day I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose a city from all the tribes of Israel where a house might be built for My name to be there. But I chose David to be over My people Israel.’
1 Kings 8:17 My father David desired to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.
1 Kings 8:18 But the Lord said to my father David: ‘Because you desired in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well in having this very thought in your mind.
1 Kings 8:19 Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who will come forth from your body—he shall build the house for My name.’
1 Kings 8:20 The Lord has fulfilled His word which He spoke. For I have risen in place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised. And I have built a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.
1 Kings 8:21 And I have prepared a place there for the Ark, which contains the Covenant of the Lord that He made with our fathers when they came out of the land of Egypt.”
1 Kings 8:22 So Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, in the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands toward the created universe.
1 Kings 8:23 And he said: “O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like You, in the created universe above or on the earth below. You keep Your covenant and show mercy to Your servants who walk before You with their whole heart.
1 Kings 8:24 You have kept what You promised to Your servant, my father David. You spoke with Your mouth, and You have fulfilled with Your hands, as this present day proves.
1 Kings 8:25 Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for Your servant my father David what You promised him, saying: ‘There shall not fail you a man from My sight to sit upon the throne of Israel, provided that your sons keep their way, to walk before Me as you have walked.’
1 Kings 8:26 And now, O God of Israel, may Your words which You spoke to Your servant, my father David, be confirmed.
1 Kings 8:27 Can it be truly believed that God would actually dwell on earth? If the created universe and even the highest created heavens cannot contain You, how much less can this temple I have built?
1 Kings 8:28 Yet, look upon the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, O Lord my God. Hear the hymn and the prayer that Your servant prays before You today.
1 Kings 8:29 May Your eyes be open toward this house night and day—this house of which You said, ‘My Name shall be there’—so that You may hear the prayer which Your servant prays to You in this place.
1 Kings 8:30 Hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, whoever prays in this place. Hear in the created universe, in Your dwelling place. And when You hear, be merciful.
1 Kings 8:31 If a man sins against his neighbor, and he is bound by an oath to testify, and he comes to Your altar in this house to swear the oath,
1 Kings 8:32 then hear from the created universe, and act, and judge Your servants. Condemn the wicked, repaying his actions upon his own head, and justify the righteous, returning to him according to his righteousness.
1 Kings 8:33 If Your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against You, yet they return to You in repentance, confess Your name, and come and pray and make supplication to You in this house,
1 Kings 8:34 then hear from the created universe, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers.
1 Kings 8:35 If the created universe is shut up and there is no rain because of their sins, yet they pray in repentance in this place, and confess Your name, and turn from their sins because You have afflicted them,
1 Kings 8:36 then hear in the created universe, and forgive the sins of Your servants and of Your people Israel, and show them the good way in which they should walk. Then send rain upon Your land, which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.
1 Kings 8:37 If there is famine in the land, or plague, or blight, or mildew, or locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities, or any other affliction, any sickness,
1 Kings 8:38 then any supplication or prayer that is made by any person among Your people Israel, each recognizing the affliction of his own heart, and spreading out his hands toward this house,
1 Kings 8:39 then hear in the created universe, from Your most firm throne, and be merciful. Act to render to each person according to all his ways, as You know his heart—for You alone know the heart of all the sons of men.
1 Kings 8:40 May they fear You all the days they live upon the face of the earth, which You gave to our fathers.
1 Kings 8:1 Then King Solomon gathered all the elders of Israel. He also gathered all the tribal leaders and the heads of the families of the sons of Israel. They all came to King Solomon in Jerusalem. This assembly was to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion.
1 Kings 8:2 And all the men of Israel gathered to King Solomon in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month of the year.
1 Kings 8:3 All the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the Ark.
1 Kings 8:4 And they brought up the Ark of the Lord, and the Tent of Meeting (also known as the Tabernacle of Testimony), and all the vessels of the Sanctuary that were in the Tabernacle. The priests and the Levites carried them.
1 Kings 8:5 King Solomon, and all the multitude of Israel who had gathered to him, sacrificed sheep and oxen before the Ark. There were so many sacrificial animals that they could not be numbered, so vast was the multitude of these offerings.
1 Kings 8:6 And the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its proper place. This was into the inner sanctuary of the house, the Holy of Holies, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
1 Kings 8:7 Indeed, the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the Ark. They covered the Ark and its carrying poles from above.
1 Kings 8:8 The poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not visible from outside. They remained there even until the present day.
1 Kings 8:9 There was nothing in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Horeb. This was when the Lord made a covenant with the sons of Israel after they had come out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings 8:10 Now it happened, when the priests came out of the Sanctuary, a cloud filled the house of the Lord.
1 Kings 8:11 And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud. This was because the glory of the Lord, the visible manifestation of God's presence and power, had filled the house of the Lord.
1 Kings 8:12 Then Solomon said, 'The Lord said that He would dwell in a cloud.'
1 Kings 8:13 I have indeed built a house as a dwelling place for You, a most firm and eternal place for Your glorious presence.
1 Kings 8:14 And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel. For all the assembly of Israel was standing.
1 Kings 8:15 And he said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel. He spoke with His own mouth to David my father, and by His works, He has brought it to pass, saying:'
1 Kings 8:16 'From the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose a city from all the tribes of Israel for a house to be built in My name there. But I chose David to be over My people Israel.'
1 Kings 8:17 'And it was the intention of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.'
1 Kings 8:18 'The Lord said to David my father: Because it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well in conceiving this very thing in your mind.'
1 Kings 8:19 'Nevertheless, you shall not build the house. But your son, who will come out from your loins, he shall build the house for My name.'
1 Kings 8:20 'The Lord has established His word which He spoke. For I have risen up in place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the Lord promised. And I have built the house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.'
1 Kings 8:21 'And there I have established a place for the Ark, in which is the Covenant of the Lord. This is the Covenant He made with our fathers when they came out of the land of Egypt.'
1 Kings 8:22 Therefore, Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands towards heaven, the dwelling place of God.
1 Kings 8:23 And he said, 'O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like You, above in heaven or below on earth. You keep covenant and show mercy to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart.'
1 Kings 8:24 'You have kept what You promised to Your servant David my father. And You have fulfilled Your words, as is proven this very day.'
1 Kings 8:25 'Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father what You spoke, saying: There shall not fail you a man in My sight to sit on the throne of Israel. Nevertheless, this is true if your sons will keep their way, and walk before Me as you have walked.'
1 Kings 8:26 'And now, O Lord, God of Israel, let Your words be confirmed, these words You spoke to David my father, Your servant.'
1 Kings 8:27 'But will God indeed dwell on the earth? For if the universe, and even the heaven of heavens, cannot contain You, how much less this house which I have built?'
1 Kings 8:28 'Yet, look upon the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Lord my God. Hear the hymn and the prayer which Your servant prays before You today.'
1 Kings 8:29 'That Your eyes may be open toward this house night and day. Toward the house of which You said, My Name shall be there, meaning My presence and authority will reside there.'
1 Kings 8:30 'That You may hear the prayer of Your servant and of Your people Israel, whenever anyone prays in this place. And You shall hear them in the place of Your dwelling, in heaven. And when You hear, You will be merciful.'
1 Kings 8:31 'If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is laid upon him because of it, and he comes to swear before Your altar in this house:'
1 Kings 8:32 'Then You, in heaven, will hear and act and judge Your servants. You will condemn the wicked and bring his way upon his own head, and You will justify the righteous, rendering to him according to his righteousness.'
1 Kings 8:33 'If Your people Israel are defeated by their enemies (because they have sinned against You), and they turn back, perform penance, supplicate You in this house, and confess Your name, acknowledging Your power and authority:'
1 Kings 8:34 'Then You will hear in heaven, and will be merciful to the sins of Your people Israel, and You will bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers.'
1 Kings 8:35 'If the sky is shut up and there is no rain because of their sins, and they pray in this place, and perform penance to Your name, and they turn from their sins because of their afflictions:'
1 Kings 8:36 'Then hear You in heaven, and be merciful to the sins of Your servants and of Your people Israel. And teach them the good way in which they should walk. And give rain upon Your land, which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.'
1 Kings 8:37 'If there is famine in the land, or pestilence, or mildew, or blight, or locusts, or caterpillars, and if their enemy besieges them in the gates of their cities, whatever plague, whatever wound they suffer:'
1 Kings 8:38 'Whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by any man, or by all Your people Israel, each one knowing the affliction of his own heart, and spreading out his hands toward this house:'
1 Kings 8:39 'Then You will hear in heaven, in the place of Your dwelling, and will be merciful, and will act. And You will render to each one according to all his ways, as You see his heart. For You alone know the heart of all the sons of men.'
1 Kings 8:40 'So that they may fear You all the days that they live upon the surface of the earth, which You gave to our fathers.'
1 Kings 8:1 Then King Solomon gathered together all the elders of Israel, and all the chiefs of the tribes, and all the heads of the households of the sons of Israel, to King Solomon in Jerusalem, so that they might bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion, the fortress part of Jerusalem.
1 Kings 8:2 And all of Israel gathered to King Solomon in the month of Ethanim, on the seventh festival period. This is the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar.
1 Kings 8:3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests carried the Ark.
1 Kings 8:4 And the priests and the Levites brought the Ark of the Lord, and the tent of the Covenant, and all the sacred vessels that were in the tent.
1 Kings 8:5 King Solomon and all the multitude of Israel who had gathered to him, in the presence of the Ark, sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted.
1 Kings 8:6 And the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, into the Holy of Holies, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
1 Kings 8:7 For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the Ark, and protected the Ark and its carrying poles from above.
1 Kings 8:8 And the Ark remained there until this present day.
1 Kings 8:9 There was nothing else in the Ark except the two stone tablets which Moses had placed there in Horeb, when the Lord gave the law to the sons of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings 8:10 And it came to pass that when the priests came out of the sanctuary, a cloud filled the house of the Lord.
1 Kings 8:11 And the priests were not able to stand and minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.
1 Kings 8:12 Then Solomon said: 'The Lord said that He would dwell in deep darkness, which He manifests in a cloud.'
1 Kings 8:13 Building, I have built a house as a dwelling place for You, and Your firm throne for all eternity.
1 Kings 8:14 And the king turned his face and blessed all the assembly of Israel, for all the assembly of Israel was standing.
1 Kings 8:15 And he said: 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spoke with His own mouth to David my father, and with His own hands, He has fulfilled what He promised, saying: '
1 Kings 8:16 'From the day when I led My people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose a city out of all the tribes of Israel, so that a house might be built there for My Name; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.'
1 Kings 8:17 'And David my father desired to build a house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel;'
1 Kings 8:18 'But the Lord said to David my father: "Because you desired to build a house for My Name, you have done well in this very thing;"'
1 Kings 8:19 'Nevertheless, you will not build the house, but your son, who will come forth from your body, he himself will build the house for My Name."'
1 Kings 8:20 The Lord has fulfilled His word which He spoke, for I have risen in place of David my father, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, just as the Lord spoke. And I have built the house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel.
1 Kings 8:21 And I have prepared a place there for the Ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord which He made with our fathers, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
1 Kings 8:22 Therefore, Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands towards the sky.
1 Kings 8:23 And he said: 'Lord God of Israel, there is no God like You, neither in the sky above, nor on the earth below. You keep covenant and show mercy to Your servants who walk before You with their whole heart.'
1 Kings 8:24 'You who have kept for Your servant David my father what You spoke to him; You spoke with Your mouth, and with Your own hands You have fulfilled it, just as it is this very day.'
1 Kings 8:25 'Now therefore, Lord God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father what You spoke to him, saying: "There shall not fail you a man from the throne of Israel." Only if your sons will guard their way and walk before Me as you yourself have walked.'
1 Kings 8:26 'And now, Lord God of Israel, let Your word be confirmed, which You spoke to Your servant David my father.'
1 Kings 8:27 'But truly, if God can dwell on the earth— the sky and the highest heavens cannot contain You, much less this house which I have built!'
1 Kings 8:28 'Yet, look upon the prayer of Your servant and upon his supplications, O Lord my God! Hear the cry and the prayer with which Your servant prays before You today;'
1 Kings 8:29 'So that Your eyes may be open toward this house, night and day— toward the house of which You said: "My Name shall be there"— so that You may hear the supplication which Your servant prays to You in this place.'
1 Kings 8:30 'So that You may hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, whatever they pray in this place. And You will hear in the place of Your dwelling in the universe— the uncreated realm beyond the created sky— and when You have heard, You will be merciful.'
1 Kings 8:31 'If a man has sinned against his neighbor, and he has taken an oath to swear, and one comes before Your altar in this house and confesses to You;'
1 Kings 8:32 'You will hear in the universe beyond created things, and You will act and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked, and returning his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, and repaying him according to his righteousness.'
1 Kings 8:33 'If Your people Israel flee before their enemies (because they will have sinned against You), and they turn and do penance, and they pray to You in this house, confessing Your Name;'
1 Kings 8:34 'You will hear in the uncreated universe, and You will be merciful to the sins of Your people Israel, and You will bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers.'
1 Kings 8:35 'If the sky is shut up and there is no rain because of their sins, and they pray in this place and do penance to Your Name, and they turn from their sins because of their affliction;'
1 Kings 8:36 'You will hear in the uncreated universe, and You will be merciful to the sins of Your servants and of Your people Israel, and You will show them the good way in which they should walk, and You will give rain upon Your land, which You gave to Your people as a possession.'
1 Kings 8:37 'If there is famine in the land, or plague, or blight, or mildew, or locusts, or rust, and if an enemy besieges them in their cities' gates— any plague, any sickness;'
1 Kings 8:38 'Whatever supplication, whatever prayer is made by any man, or by all of Your people Israel, when each one acknowledges the wound of his own heart, and spreads out his hands in this house;'
1 Kings 8:39 'You will hear in the uncreated universe, from Your firm throne, and You will be merciful and You will act. And You will repay each one according to all his ways, just as You alone see his heart, You who know the hearts of all the sons of men;'
1 Kings 8:40 'So that they may fear You all the days that they live upon the face of the earth which You gave to our fathers.'
1 Kings 9:1 It came to pass after Solomon had finished building the Lord's Temple and his own royal palace. He had completed everything he desired and had wanted to do.
1 Kings 9:2 The Lord appeared to Solomon a second time, just as He had appeared to him in Gibeon before.
1 Kings 9:3 And the Lord said to him: "I have heard your prayer and your petition, which you presented before Me. I have consecrated this Temple that you have built so that I may establish My presence there for all time. My divine attention and My love will be there always.
1 Kings 9:4 As for you, if you will walk before Me with sincerity of heart and in uprightness, just as your father David walked, and if you will do everything that I have commanded you, and keep My statutes and My judgments,
1 Kings 9:5 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised your father David when I said: 'A man from your lineage shall not be cut off from the throne of Israel.'
1 Kings 9:6 But if you and your sons turn away from Me, not keeping My commandments and My ceremonies which I have set before you, but instead go and serve foreign gods and worship them,
1 Kings 9:7 then I will cast Israel from the face of the land which I have given them. And this Temple, which I have consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight. Then Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
1 Kings 9:8 And this house will become an example of desolation. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss in dismay, saying: 'Why has the Lord done such things to this land and to this Temple?'
1 Kings 9:9 And they will respond: 'Because they abandoned the Lord their God, who led their fathers out of the land of Egypt. And they followed foreign gods, and worshipped them, and served them. Therefore, the Lord has brought all this evil upon them.'
1 Kings 9:10 Now it came to pass after twenty years, during which Solomon had built the two houses: that is, the Lord's Temple and the royal palace.
1 Kings 9:11 So King Hiram of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar wood, fir wood, and gold, according to all his desire.
1 Kings 9:12 In return, Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
1 Kings 9:13 When Hiram went out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, they did not please him at all.
1 Kings 9:14 And he said: "What kind of cities are these which you have given me, my brother?" And he called them the land of Cabul—meaning 'worthless land'—a name it kept until this very day.
1 Kings 9:15 This is the summary of the tribute which King Solomon imposed for building the Lord's Temple, and his own royal palace, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
1 Kings 9:16 Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had gone up and taken Gezer, and burned it with fire. He killed the Canaanites who lived in the city. Then he gave it as a dowry to his daughter, who became Solomon's wife.
1 Kings 9:17 So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and Lower Beth Horon.
1 Kings 9:18 He also rebuilt Baalath and Tamar, which was in the desert wilderness.
1 Kings 9:19 And he built all the store-cities that belonged to Solomon, along with the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen. He also built everything else that pleased him to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land under his dominion.
1 Kings 9:20 All the people who were left of the Amorites, and Hittites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites—these were the peoples who were not of the children of Israel.
1 Kings 9:21 Their children, who were left in the land and whom the children of Israel had not been able to utterly destroy, Solomon forced their descendants to be his bondservants and laborers, a practice that continued until this day.
1 Kings 9:22 However, Solomon did not make any of the children of Israel to be bondservants. Instead, they served as warriors, his personal attendants, his princes, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and horsemen.
1 Kings 9:23 These were the chief officers over Solomon's work: five hundred and fifty men who presided over the people and those who performed the labor.
1 Kings 9:24 But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her. It was then that he built Millo.
1 Kings 9:25 Solomon also offered burnt offerings and peace offerings three times each year upon the altar which he had built for the Lord. And he also burned incense upon the incense altar which he had dedicated to the Lord. Thus, the construction of the Temple was completed.
1 Kings 9:26 King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Elath, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
1 Kings 9:27 And King Hiram of Tyre sent his ships with the fleet, and his servants who were experienced sailors and mariners who knew the sea, along with Solomon's servants.
1 Kings 9:28 When they had come to Ophir, they obtained from there four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought it back to King Solomon.
1 Kings 9:29 Now the Queen of Sheba, having heard of the fame of Solomon and his relationship with the Lord, came to test him with difficult riddles.
1 Kings 9:30 And she entered Jerusalem with a great company and with camels bearing spices, and a very large amount of gold, and precious stones. She came to Solomon and spoke to him all that was in her heart.
1 Kings 9:31 And Solomon answered all the questions she proposed. There was no word hidden from the king that he could not answer for her.
1 Kings 9:32 But when the Queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built,
1 Kings 9:33 and the food on his table, and the dwellings of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings which he offered in the house of the Lord, she was utterly overwhelmed and breathless.
1 Kings 9:34 And she said to the king: "The report which I heard in my own land about your deeds and about your wisdom is true.
1 Kings 9:35 And I did not believe those who told me until I myself came and saw with my own eyes. Now I have proved that not even half had been told to me. Your wisdom and your works are far greater than the report I heard."
1 Kings 9:36 "Blessed are your men, and blessed are these servants of yours, who stand before you always and hear your wisdom.
1 Kings 9:37 Blessed be the Lord your God, with whom you were pleased, and who set you upon the throne of Israel. This is because the Lord loved Israel and desired that there be a king, and that you should render judgment and justice."
1 Kings 9:38 So she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very large amount of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought as those which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
1 Kings 9:39 Moreover, Hiram's fleet of ships, which brought gold from Ophir, also brought from Ophir an enormous amount of almug wood—also known as algum or thyine wood—along with many precious stones.
1 Kings 9:40 And from the almug wood, the king made supports for the house of the Lord and for the royal house, and lyres and harps for the singers. No such almug wood has been brought or seen until this present day.
1 Kings 9:1 Now it came to pass when Solomon had completed the construction of the Lord's Temple and the king's palace, and everything else he had desired and wished for,
1 Kings 9:2 the Lord appeared to him a second time, just as He had appeared to him previously in Gabaon.
1 Kings 9:3 And the Lord said to him: "I have heard your prayer and your petition, which you prayed before Me. I have sanctified this Temple which you have built, so that My Name may be placed there forever. My eyes and My heart will be there for all time."
1 Kings 9:4 "You, too, if you walk before Me, just as your father David walked with integrity of heart and in righteousness, and if you do everything I have commanded you, and keep My statutes and My ordinances,
1 Kings 9:5 I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised your father David, saying: 'There shall not fail a man of your line to sit on the throne of Israel.'"
1 Kings 9:6 "But if you, or your children, turn away from Me, and do not keep My commandments and My ceremonies, which I have set before you, but instead go and serve foreign gods and worship them,
1 Kings 9:7 then I will cut off Israel from the face of the earth which I have given to them. And this Temple, which I have sanctified for My Name, I will cast away from My presence. Israel will then become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
1 Kings 9:8 This Temple, even in its ruin, will serve as a warning. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss in dismay, saying: 'Why has the Lord done this to this land and to this Temple?'
1 Kings 9:9 And they will answer: 'Because they abandoned the Lord their God, who led their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and they followed foreign gods, and worshipped them, and served them. Therefore, the Lord has brought all this evil upon them.'"
1 Kings 9:10 Now, at the end of twenty years, after Solomon had built the two structures — that is, the Lord's Temple and the king's palace —
1 Kings 9:11 (Hiram, king of Tyre, had supplied Solomon with cedar, pine wood, and gold, according to all that he needed.) Then Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
1 Kings 9:12 But when Hiram came from Tyre to inspect the cities which Solomon had given him, they displeased him.
1 Kings 9:13 So he said: "What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?" And he called that land 'Cabul' — which means 'good for nothing' — even to this present day.
1 Kings 9:14 Moreover, Hiram had sent Solomon one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
1 Kings 9:15 This is an account of the levy King Solomon raised to build the Lord's Temple, his own palace, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
1 Kings 9:16 Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had gone up and captured Gezer, and burned it with fire. He had killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and then he gave it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
1 Kings 9:17 So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, and Lower Beth Horon,
1 Kings 9:18 and Baalath, and Tamar (Palmyra) in the desert land.
1 Kings 9:19 He also built all the storage cities that were around these cities, as well as the chariot cities, and the cavalry cities. He built everything that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his kingdom.
1 Kings 9:20 All the people who remained of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites — who were not of the children of Israel —
1 Kings 9:21 their descendants who remained in the land after them, whom the children of Israel could not completely destroy — these Solomon made subject to forced labor, a tribute, even to this present day.
1 Kings 9:22 But Solomon did not make any of the children of Israel his forced laborers. Instead, they were his warriors, his servants, his officials, his commanders, and the officers over his chariots and his cavalry.
1 Kings 9:23 These were the chief officers overseeing Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty in number, who ruled over the people and over those who performed the work.
1 Kings 9:24 But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the City of David to her own palace, which Solomon had built for her. It was after this that Solomon built the Millo.
1 Kings 9:25 Also, three times each year, Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar that he had built for the Lord. He burned incense there before the Lord. And so, the Temple was completed with its regular sacrifices.
1 Kings 9:26 King Solomon also built a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is near Elath, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
1 Kings 9:27 And Hiram sent his own experienced sailors, men skilled in the sea, to be on the fleet with Solomon's servants.
1 Kings 9:28 When they arrived in Ophir, they brought back gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and presented it to King Solomon.
1 Kings 9:29 At that time, the Queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, specifically regarding his wisdom from the Lord, and she came to test him with difficult questions and riddles.
1 Kings 9:30 She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large entourage, with riches, and with camels carrying spices, an immense amount of gold, and precious gems. When she came to King Solomon, she spoke with him about everything that was on her mind and in her heart.
1 Kings 9:31 And Solomon answered all the questions she put to him. There was no matter hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.
1 Kings 9:32 When the Queen of Sheba saw all of Solomon's wisdom, and the palace that he had built,
1 Kings 9:33 and the food on his table, and the residences of his servants, and the organization of his attendants, and their uniforms, and his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings which he offered in the Lord's Temple, she was completely overwhelmed; she was left breathless.
1 Kings 9:34 And she said to the king: "The report that I heard in my own land concerning your words and your wisdom is truly accurate.
1 Kings 9:35 I did not believe those who told me, until I myself came and saw with my own eyes. And I have confirmed that even half of it had not been reported to me. Your wisdom and your achievements are greater than the rumor I heard.
1 Kings 9:36 Blessed are your men, and blessed are your servants, who always stand before you and hear your wisdom.
1 Kings 9:37 Blessed be the Lord your God, in whom you found favor, who has placed you upon the throne of Israel. This is because the Lord loved Israel and desired to save them forever. And for that reason, He has made you king over them, so that you may execute justice and righteousness.
1 Kings 9:38 Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and an extremely large quantity of spices, and precious gems. Never again was such a vast quantity of spices brought in as the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
1 Kings 9:39 King Solomon, for his part, gave the Queen of Sheba everything she desired and asked of him, in addition to what he had already given her freely.
1 Kings 9:40 Then she returned and went back to her own land, along with her servants.
1 Kings 10:1 The Queen of Sheba, having heard of Solomon's great fame and the wisdom he displayed in all his works for the Lord, came to Jerusalem to test him with intricate riddles.
1 Kings 10:2 She arrived in Jerusalem with a large company of attendants and camels, laden with fragrant spices, a truly immense quantity of gold, and many precious jewels. When she met King Solomon, she spoke to him everything that was in her mind and heart.
1 Kings 10:3 King Solomon then answered all the difficult questions she had proposed to him; there was no word or concept hidden from the King that he could not explain.
1 Kings 10:4 So the Queen of Sheba saw for herself all of Solomon's wisdom, and she beheld the splendid royal palace he had built,
1 Kings 10:5 and the lavish food upon his table, and the well-ordered arrangement of his servants' dwellings, and the orderly service of his ministers, and their fine apparel, and his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings which he regularly presented in the house of the Lord. She was utterly overwhelmed and left breathless by it all.
1 Kings 10:6 She then said to the King: “The report I heard in my own land concerning your great sayings and your profound wisdom is true.
1 Kings 10:7 I did not believe those who told me, until I myself came here and saw it with my own eyes. I can now confirm that not even half was told to me. Your wisdom and your accomplishments are far greater than the grand report I heard.”
1 Kings 10:8 “Blessed are your own men, and truly blessed are these servants of yours, who constantly stand before you and hear your profound wisdom.
1 Kings 10:9 May the Lord your God be blessed, in whom you have found favor and who has placed you upon the throne of Israel. This is because the Lord has loved Israel eternally, and He has established you as king, so that you might execute true judgment and administer perfect justice.”
1 Kings 10:10 Then she presented the King with one hundred twenty talents of gold, an exceedingly great quantity of aromatic spices, and many precious gems. There were never again brought such an abundance of spices as the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
1 Kings 10:11 Furthermore, Hiram's fleet of ships, which regularly brought gold from Ophir, also brought from Ophir an exceedingly large quantity of very rare almug wood, and many precious gems.
1 Kings 10:12 From this almug wood, the King fashioned supports for the Temple of the Lord and for the royal palace. He also had lyres and harps made for the singers. No such almug wood has ever been brought or seen in Israel until this present day.
1 Kings 10:13 Thus, King Solomon gave the Queen of Sheba everything she desired and requested from him, in addition to the royal gifts which he had generously offered her. After this, she returned and journeyed back to her own land with her servants.
1 Kings 10:14 Now the weight of the gold that was brought to King Solomon each year amounted to six hundred sixty-six talents of pure gold,
1 Kings 10:15 this was besides what was regularly brought to him by the tax-collectors, and by the traders, and by all the merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia, and from all the governors of the lands.
1 Kings 10:16 King Solomon also made two hundred large shields of refined pure gold; six hundred shekels of gold were used for the plating of each individual shield.
1 Kings 10:17 And he made three hundred smaller shields of beaten, refined gold; three minas of gold covered each individual shield. The King placed these shields in the House of the Forest of Lebanon, a royal armory.
1 Kings 10:18 The King also constructed a great royal throne made of ivory, which he overlaid with an exceedingly brilliant, gleaming gold.
1 Kings 10:19 There were six steps leading up to the throne, and the back of the throne was rounded at the top. On either side, two arms supported the seat, and two carved lions stood beside these arms.
1 Kings 10:20 And twelve smaller carved lions stood upon the six steps, six on each side. No such masterful work had ever been made in all the kingdoms of the earth.
1 Kings 10:21 Furthermore, all of King Solomon's drinking vessels were made of solid gold, and all the furnishings of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of the purest gold. Silver was not considered valuable at all, nor was it esteemed as anything of worth in the days of Solomon.
1 Kings 10:22 For the King's fleet of ships, sailing the sea together with Hiram's fleet, went to Tarshish once every three years. From there, they brought back gold, and silver, and ivory tusks, and apes, and peacocks.
1 Kings 10:23 Thus, King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in both his immense wealth and his profound wisdom.
1 Kings 10:24 And the entire world desired to behold Solomon, so that they might hear the extraordinary wisdom which God had placed in his heart.
1 Kings 10:25 And each person brought him gifts, vessels of silver and of gold, fine garments, and weapons, and aromatic spices, horses, and mules, year after year without fail.
1 Kings 10:26 Solomon also amassed chariots and cavalry; he acquired fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. He stationed them in garrison cities designated for chariots and also kept some with the King in Jerusalem.
1 Kings 10:27 The King caused silver to be as plentiful in Jerusalem as ordinary stones. And he made cedar wood as abundant as the sycamore trees that grow in the lowlands.
1 Kings 10:28 The horses for Solomon were brought out of Egypt and from Coa. The King's merchants bought them from Coa at a fixed price, and then transported them.
1 Kings 10:29 A four-wheeled chariot was valued at six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse at one hundred fifty shekels. By this same arrangement, horses and chariots were sold to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria through Solomon's intermediaries.
1 Kings 11:1 King Solomon, however, began to fall deeply in love with many foreign women—women who did not worship the true God. These included the daughter of Pharaoh, and women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and the Hittite lands.
1 Kings 11:2 These were women from the nations about whom the Lord had strictly commanded the children of Israel: 'You must not go among them, and they must not come among you, for they will most certainly turn your hearts away to follow their false gods.' Despite this divine warning, Solomon became joined to these women because of his intense love for them.
1 Kings 11:3 Solomon had seven hundred royal wives and three hundred concubines, for a total of one thousand women. These women then turned his heart away from his true devotion to God.
1 Kings 11:4 Indeed, when he was already an old man, his heart was corrupted by these women, so that he began to follow their foreign gods. His devotion to the Lord his God was not complete, as was the devotion of David his father.
1 Kings 11:5 Instead, Solomon worshipped Ashtart, the false goddess of the Sidonians, and Moloch, the detestable idol of the Ammonites.
1 Kings 11:6 Solomon thus did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and he did not fully commit to following the Lord, as David his father had done.
1 Kings 11:7 It was then that Solomon built a high place, a temple, for Chemosh, the detestable idol of the Moabites, on the hill that faces Jerusalem. He also built one for Moloch, the detestable idol of the children of Ammon.
1 Kings 11:8 He built these places of idolatry for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their false gods.
1 Kings 11:9 Therefore, the Lord's wrath was kindled against Solomon, because his devotion had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel. This was the same God who had appeared to him twice before—
1 Kings 11:10 —and had specifically commanded him regarding this very thing: not to follow foreign gods. But Solomon did not keep what the Lord had commanded him.
1 Kings 11:11 So the Lord said to Solomon: 'Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My commandments which I entrusted to you, I will surely tear your kingdom apart and give it to one of your servants.'
1 Kings 11:12 'However, I will not do this during your lifetime, out of respect for David your father. Instead, I will tear it out of the hand of your son.'
1 Kings 11:13 'Yet, I will not take away the entire kingdom. I will leave one tribe for your son, for the sake of David My servant, and for Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen.'
1 Kings 11:14 So the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon: Hadad the Edomite, a descendant of the royal lineage of Edom.
1 Kings 11:15 This occurred when David was in Edom, and Joab, the commander of the army, had gone up to bury those slain in battle, and had struck down every male in Edom.
1 Kings 11:16 Joab had remained in Edom for six months until he had completely eliminated every male there.
1 Kings 11:17 Hadad himself, along with some Edomite men who had been servants of his father, fled with him to enter Egypt. At that time, Hadad was still a very young boy.
1 Kings 11:18 When they set out from Midian, they came to Paran, and took men from Paran with them. They then entered Egypt, going to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Hadad a house, provided him with food, and assigned him land.
1 Kings 11:19 Hadad found such great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, that Pharaoh even gave him his own sister-in-law, the sister of Queen Tahpenes, as a wife.
1 Kings 11:20 The sister of Queen Tahpenes bore Hadad a son named Genubath. Tahpenes raised Genubath in Pharaoh's own palace, and Genubath grew up there among Pharaoh's own sons.
1 Kings 11:21 When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had died and was resting with his ancestors, and that Joab, the commander of the army, was also dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh: 'Allow me to leave, so that I may return to my own land.'
1 Kings 11:22 Pharaoh asked him, 'What do you lack here with me, that you seek to return to your own land?' Hadad replied, 'Nothing at all, but only let me go.'
1 Kings 11:23 God also raised up another adversary against Solomon: Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer, the king of Zobah.
1 Kings 11:24 Rezon had gathered men around himself and became the leader of a raiding band. This occurred when David was defeating those from Zobah. Rezon and his men went to Damascus, settled there, and began to rule in Damascus.
1 Kings 11:25 Rezon became an adversary to Israel throughout all the days of Solomon's reign. This was in addition to the harm caused by Hadad, and Rezon's intense hatred against Israel. He reigned over Syria.
1 Kings 11:26 Jeroboam also, the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite from Zeredah, who was a servant of Solomon (and whose mother was a widow named Zeruah), raised his hand against the king.
1 Kings 11:27 This was the reason for his rebellion: Solomon had built the Millo fortress and had closed up the breach in the City of David, his father.
1 Kings 11:28 Jeroboam was a strong and capable man. When Solomon saw that the young man was diligently prepared for work, he put him in charge of all the forced labor from the house of Joseph.
1 Kings 11:29 It happened at that time that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way. Ahijah was wearing a new cloak. It happened that there were only the two of them in the field.
1 Kings 11:30 Ahijah then took hold of his new cloak that he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
1 Kings 11:31 And he said to Jeroboam: 'Take ten pieces for yourself, for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I will tear the kingdom away from the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes.'
1 Kings 11:32 'However, one tribe will remain for Solomon's son, for the sake of David My servant, and for Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.'
1 Kings 11:33 'I will do this because Solomon has forsaken Me and has worshipped Ashtart, the false goddess of the Sidonians; Chemosh, the false god of the Moabites; and Moloch, the false god of the children of Ammon. He has not walked in My ways, to do what is right in My sight, nor kept My commandments and My judgments, as David his father did.'
1 Kings 11:34 'Nevertheless, I will not take the entire kingdom from his hand. Instead, I will let him remain ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose, and who kept My commandments and My precepts.'
1 Kings 11:35 'But I will take the kingdom from the hand of his son, and I will give ten tribes to you.'
1 Kings 11:36 'To his son, however, I will give one tribe, so that a lamp for David My servant may remain before Me always in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen, so that My name may be there.'
1 Kings 11:37 'Therefore I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.'
1 Kings 11:38 'If, therefore, you listen to all that I command you, and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight, keeping My commandments and My precepts, just as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty, a faithful house, just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.'
1 Kings 11:39 'And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this, but not for all time.'
1 Kings 11:40 Therefore, Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak, the king of Egypt, and he remained in Egypt until Solomon's death.
1 Kings 11:1 King Solomon passionately loved many foreign women. This included Pharaoh’s daughter, along with women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and the Hittite people.
1 Kings 11:2 These were women from nations about whom the Lord had strictly warned the children of Israel: 'You shall not marry them, nor shall they marry you. For they will most certainly turn your hearts away from Me, causing you to follow their false gods.' But King Solomon, in his deep affection, became joined to these women.
1 Kings 11:3 He had seven hundred wives who were princesses, and three hundred concubines. And these women turned his heart away from God.
1 Kings 11:4 When he became old, his heart was corrupted by these women, so that he followed other gods. His heart was not perfectly devoted to the Lord his God, unlike the heart of his father David.
1 Kings 11:5 Instead, Solomon began to worship Astaroth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Moloch, the idol of the Ammonites.
1 Kings 11:6 Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not fully obey the Lord, as his father David had done.
1 Kings 11:7 Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the idol of Moab, on the hill facing Jerusalem. He also built a high place for Moloch, the idol of the Ammonite people.
1 Kings 11:8 In this manner, he did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their own gods.
1 Kings 11:9 Therefore, the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his mind had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel. This was especially grievous because the Lord had appeared to Solomon twice before.
1 Kings 11:10 And the Lord had specifically commanded him not to follow other gods. But Solomon did not keep the commands that the Lord had given him.
1 Kings 11:11 So the Lord said to Solomon: 'Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My commands which I entrusted to you, I will surely tear your kingdom apart and give it to your servant.'
1 Kings 11:12 'However, for the sake of your father David, I will not do this during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.'
1 Kings 11:13 'Nevertheless, I will not take away the entire kingdom. I will leave one tribe for your son, for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.'
1 Kings 11:14 So the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon: Hadad the Edomite, who was of the royal line in Edom.
1 Kings 11:15 For when David was in Edom, and Joab, the commander of the army, had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck down every male in Edom—
1 Kings 11:16 Joab and all Israel remained there for six months, until they had completely wiped out every male in Edom.
1 Kings 11:17 So Hadad himself fled, along with some Edomite men who were servants of his father, in order to enter Egypt. At that time, Hadad was just a small boy.
1 Kings 11:18 When they set out from Midian, they came to Paran. They took men with them from Paran and then entered Egypt, presenting themselves to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Hadad a house, provided him with provisions, and even assigned him land.
1 Kings 11:19 Hadad found such great favor with Pharaoh that Pharaoh gave him as wife the sister of his own queen, Queen Tahpenes.
1 Kings 11:20 The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath. Tahpenes raised Genubath in Pharaoh’s house, and Genubath remained in Pharaoh’s household with Pharaoh’s own sons.
1 Kings 11:21 When Hadad heard in Egypt that King David had died and was resting with his ancestors, and that Joab, the commander of the army, was also dead, he said to Pharaoh: 'Allow me to leave, so I can return to my own land.'
1 Kings 11:22 Pharaoh asked him: 'What, then, do you lack with me, that you seek to return to your own land?' But Hadad replied: 'Nothing at all. I only beg you to let me go.'
1 Kings 11:23 God also raised up another adversary for Solomon: Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer, the king of Zobah.
1 Kings 11:24 Rezon gathered men around him and became the leader of a raiding band, at the time when David defeated Hadadezer. They then went to Damascus, settled there, and began to rule in Damascus.
1 Kings 11:25 Rezon was an adversary to Israel throughout all the days of Solomon's reign. This was in addition to the trouble caused by Hadad, and Rezon hated Israel, reigning in Syria.
1 Kings 11:26 Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, also lifted his hand in rebellion against the king. He was a servant of Solomon, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.
1 Kings 11:27 And this was the reason for his rebellion: Solomon had built the Millo, and had closed up the breach in the city of his father David.
1 Kings 11:28 Now Jeroboam was a strong and capable man. When Solomon saw that the young man was diligent and industrious, he appointed him over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.
1 Kings 11:29 It happened at that time, as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road. Ahijah was wearing a new cloak, and they were the only two people in the open field.
1 Kings 11:30 Ahijah then took his new cloak that he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
1 Kings 11:31 And Ahijah said to Jeroboam: 'Take ten pieces for yourself. For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: "Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom away from the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes."
1 Kings 11:32 'But one tribe will remain for Solomon's son, for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel.'
1 Kings 11:33 'This judgment comes because Solomon has abandoned Me. He has worshipped Astaroth, the goddess of the Sidonians; Chemosh, the god of Moab; and Moloch, the god of the Ammonite people. He has not walked in My ways, nor done what is right in My sight, nor kept My commands and My judgments, as his father David did.'
1 Kings 11:34 'However, I will not take the entire kingdom from his hand during his lifetime. Instead, I will let him remain ruler for all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose, and who kept My commands and My precepts.'
1 Kings 11:35 'But I will take the kingdom from the hand of his son, and I will give ten tribes to you.'
1 Kings 11:36 'And to his son, I will give one tribe, so that My servant David may always have a lamp burning before Me—meaning a continuous royal line and presence—in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for My name to be there forever.'
1 Kings 11:37 'As for you, take power. You will reign over all that your heart desires, and you will be king over Israel.'
1 Kings 11:38 'If you listen to all that I command you, and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight, keeping My commands and My precepts, just as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty, just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.'
1 Kings 11:39 'And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this, though not forever.'
1 Kings 11:40 Therefore, Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam rose up and fled to Egypt, to King Shishak of Egypt, and remained in Egypt until Solomon's death.
1 Kings 11:1 Now, King Solomon loved many foreign women, even Pharaoh's daughter who he had previously married, along with women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and the Hittites.
1 Kings 11:2 These were from the nations about whom the Lord had strictly warned the children of Israel, saying: 'Do not mix with them, nor let them mix with you, for they will most certainly turn your heart away to follow their false gods.' Yet Solomon joined himself to these women with burning love.
1 Kings 11:3 He had seven hundred royal wives and three hundred concubines. And these women did turn his heart away.
1 Kings 11:4 When he was old, his heart was corrupted by these women, so that he began to follow their foreign, false gods. His heart was not wholly devoted to the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father David.
1 Kings 11:5 For Solomon began to worship Astarte, the false goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech, the vile idol of the Ammonites.
1 Kings 11:6 Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not fully follow the Lord, as his father David had done.
1 Kings 11:7 Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the idol of the Moabites, on the hill that faces Jerusalem, and also for Molech, the idol of the children of Ammon.
1 Kings 11:8 And in this same manner, he built cultic sites for all his foreign wives who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their own false gods.
1 Kings 11:9 The Lord became angry with Solomon, because his mind and heart had turned away from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice before this time,
1 Kings 11:10 and had commanded him concerning this very matter: that he should not follow foreign gods. But Solomon did not keep what the Lord had commanded him.
1 Kings 11:11 Therefore, the Lord said to Solomon: 'Because this has happened within you, and you have not kept My covenant and My commandments which I gave to you, I will surely tear your kingdom apart and give it to one of your servants.'
1 Kings 11:12 'Nevertheless, I will not do this during your days, for the sake of your father David. Instead, I will tear it out of the hand of your son.'
1 Kings 11:13 'But I will not take away the entire kingdom. I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen as My holy city.'
1 Kings 11:14 So the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon—Hadad the Edomite, who was of the royal lineage in Edom.
1 Kings 11:15 For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, he struck down every male in Edom,
1 Kings 11:16 for Joab and all of Israel remained there for six months until they had cut off every male in Edom.
1 Kings 11:17 But Hadad himself fled, along with some Edomite men who were servants of his father. They headed for Egypt, because Hadad was still a small boy at that time.
1 Kings 11:18 When they had risen up from Midian, they came to Paran. They took men with them from Paran and then entered Egypt to Pharaoh, the King of Egypt. Pharaoh gave Hadad a house, provided him with food, and assigned him land.
1 Kings 11:19 And Hadad found such great favor with Pharaoh that Pharaoh gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes.
1 Kings 11:20 And Queen Tahpenes's sister bore him a son, Genubath. Tahpenes raised Genubath in Pharaoh's house, so Genubath was in Pharaoh's household with Pharaoh's own sons.
1 Kings 11:21 When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had fallen asleep with his fathers—meaning he had died—and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, 'Let me go, so that I may return to my own land.'
1 Kings 11:22 Pharaoh said to him, 'What do you lack with me that you seek to go to your own land?' He replied, 'Nothing, but only let me go.'
1 Kings 11:23 God also raised up another adversary against Solomon: Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer, the king of Zobah.
1 Kings 11:24 Rezon gathered men around him and became a leader of raiders when David defeated Hadadezer. They went to Damascus and lived there, and Rezon reigned in Damascus.
1 Kings 11:25 Rezon was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon. This was the harm caused by Hadad, and Rezon's hatred against Israel, and he reigned over Syria.
1 Kings 11:26 Jeroboam also, the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, was a servant of Solomon. His mother was a widow named Zeruah. And he lifted up his hand, meaning he rebelled, against the king.
1 Kings 11:27 This was the cause of his rebellion: Solomon was building the Millo, and he had joined up the city of his father David—referring to the expansion of Jerusalem.
1 Kings 11:28 Now Jeroboam was a strong and mighty man. And Solomon, seeing that the young man was diligently prepared for work, appointed him over all the labor force of the house of Joseph—meaning the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.
1 Kings 11:29 It happened then, at that time, that Jeroboam went out from Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet from Shiloh met him on the way. Ahijah was wearing a new cloak, and they were the only two men in the open field.
1 Kings 11:30 Ahijah took hold of his new cloak which he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
1 Kings 11:31 And he said to Jeroboam: 'Take ten pieces for yourself, for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you.'
1 Kings 11:32 'But one tribe shall remain for him—meaning for Solomon's lineage—for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.'
1 Kings 11:33 'This will happen because Solomon has forsaken Me and has worshipped Astarte, the false goddess of the Sidonians, and Chemosh, the false god of the Moabites, and Molech, the vile god of the children of Ammon. And he has not walked in My ways, to do what is just before Me, nor kept My commandments and My judgments, as his father David did.'
1 Kings 11:34 'I will not take the entire kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him a ruler for all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and My precepts.'
1 Kings 11:35 'But I will take the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and I will give ten tribes to you.'
1 Kings 11:36 'And to his son I will give one tribe, so that a lamp—meaning a lineage and kingship—may remain for My servant David for all days before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for My name to be there.'
1 Kings 11:37 'Therefore, I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.'
1 Kings 11:38 'If, therefore, you will listen to all that I command you, and walk in My ways, and do what is right before Me, keeping My commandments and My precepts, just as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build for you a lasting house—meaning a dynasty—just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.'
1 Kings 11:39 'And I will afflict the descendants of David because of this—meaning because of Solomon's sin—but not for all days.'
1 Kings 11:40 Therefore, Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak, the king of Egypt, and remained in Egypt until Solomon's death.
1 Kings 12:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all of Israel had gathered there to make him their king.
1 Kings 12:2 When Jeroboam, son of Nebat, heard this news, he was still in Egypt, because he had fled there from King Solomon and was living in Egypt at the time.
1 Kings 12:3 So the people sent for Jeroboam and called him back. Jeroboam and all the multitude of Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying:
1 Kings 12:4 Your father oppressed us with a very harsh rule. So now, you should lighten some of your father's harsh control and ease the very heavy burden he placed on us, and we will serve you.
1 Kings 12:5 Rehoboam said to them: "Go away for three days, and then return to me with your answer." And when the people had left,
1 Kings 12:6 Rehoboam consulted with the elder advisors who had served before his father Solomon when he was still alive. He said: "What counsel do you give me so that I may answer these people?"
1 Kings 12:7 The elder advisors said to him: "If today you show obedience to these people, and serve them, and speak gentle words to them, they will serve you all your days."
1 Kings 12:8 But Rehoboam abandoned the wise counsel of the elders, which they had given him. Instead, he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and were now his royal attendants.
1 Kings 12:9 He said to them: "What counsel do you give me so that I may answer these people, who spoke to me, saying: 'Lighten the heavy burden that your father imposed on us' ?"
1 Kings 12:10 The young men who had grown up with him answered, saying: "You shall speak to these people, who spoke to you, saying: 'Your father made our burden heavy, you relieve us.' This is what you shall say to them: 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins, meaning I am more powerful than him.'"
1 Kings 12:11 "My father placed a heavy burden upon you, but I will make your burden even heavier. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scourges armed with barbs—'scorpions' as they are called."
1 Kings 12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had instructed, saying: "Return to me on the third day."
1 Kings 12:13 So the king answered the people more harshly, having ignored the wise counsel of the elders, which they had given him.
1 Kings 12:14 And he spoke according to the counsel of the young men, saying: "My father made your burden heavy, but I will make your burden even heavier. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scourges armed with barbs."
1 Kings 12:15 The king did not listen to the people's pleas, because the Lord had turned his heart away from doing so. This was done to fulfill God's own word, which He had spoken through the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, son of Nebat.
1 Kings 12:16 Therefore, when all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people answered the king, saying: "What share do we have any longer in David's lineage? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse's house, meaning we reject the royal line! To your tents, O Israel! Look to your own house, David—we disown your authority!" And so, the tribes of Israel went to their own encampments.
1 Kings 12:17 However, Rehoboam continued to reign over the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, specifically the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.
1 Kings 12:18 Therefore King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of collecting the forced labor and tribute payments, to the rebellious tribes. But all Israel stoned him to death. Then King Rehoboam quickly mounted his royal chariot and fled to Jerusalem to escape.
1 Kings 12:19 And so, the ten northern tribes of Israel permanently separated from the house of David's rule, a separation that continues to this very day.
1 Kings 12:20 Now all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned from Egypt. So they sent for him and called him to a gathering of all the people, and they made him king over all the tribes of Israel, except for the tribe of Judah alone, which remained loyal to Rehoboam.
1 Kings 12:21 But Rehoboam came to Jerusalem and gathered all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a total of one hundred eighty thousand chosen warriors, intending to fight against the house of Israel—the northern tribes—and bring the kingdom back under his control.
1 Kings 12:22 But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, a prophet of God, saying:
1 Kings 12:23 Speak to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people who are with him, saying:
1 Kings 12:24 "Thus says the Lord: 'You shall not go up to fight against your brothers, the children of Israel. Let each one return to his own house, because this division has been done by My will and My word.'" They heard the word of the Lord, and they turned back from their journey, just as the Lord had commanded them.
1 Kings 12:25 Now Jeroboam rebuilt the city of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and established his residence there. And going out from there, he also rebuilt Penuel.
1 Kings 12:26 And Jeroboam said in his heart: "Now, if things continue as they are, the loyalty of the kingdom will revert to the house of David."
1 Kings 12:27 "If these people continue to go up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord, then the hearts of these people will turn back to their lord, Rehoboam, king of Judah. They will kill me, and return their allegiance to Rehoboam, king of Judah."
1 Kings 12:28 So, after careful deliberation, Jeroboam made two golden calves. Then he said to the people: "You have traveled enough to Jerusalem. Look, O Israel, these are your gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt!"
1 Kings 12:29 He placed one golden calf in Bethel, and the other he placed in Dan, two cities at opposite ends of his kingdom.
1 Kings 12:30 And this action became a great sin for Israel, for the people went to worship the golden calf even as far as Dan, engaging in idolatry.
1 Kings 12:31 Jeroboam also made temples on the high places, meaning shrines on hills and mountains, and appointed priests from the lowest ranks of the people who were not from the priestly tribe of Levi.
1 Kings 12:32 And Jeroboam appointed a feast day in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, mimicking the solemn feast that was celebrated in Judah, the Feast of Tabernacles. And going up to the altar, he did likewise in Bethel, to sacrifice to the golden calves which he had made, and he appointed priests of the high places which he had established in Bethel.
1 Kings 12:33 And he went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month—a feast day which he had devised from his own heart, not according to God's law. He made a solemn feast for the children of Israel, and he went up to the altar to burn incense.
1 Kings 12:38 The Lord fulfilled this word which He had spoken to Jeroboam concerning the division of the kingdom.
1 Kings 12:39 And because of this sin of Jeroboam, and the sin of his entire household, through which they sinned and caused all Israel to sin with idolatry, the Lord turned away Israel from Himself and delivered them into the hands of those who would plunder them.
1 Kings 12:40 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, how he fought wars, and how he reigned as king, behold, these things are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1 Kings 12:1 Rehoboam, the son of King Solomon, then went to Shechem. For all of the tribes of Israel had gathered there to declare him their king.
1 Kings 12:2 When Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, heard this news—he was in Egypt at the time because he had fled there from King Solomon and was living in Egypt—
1 Kings 12:3 they sent word and called him back. So Jeroboam and the entire assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying:
1 Kings 12:4 “Your father, King Solomon, put a very heavy burden of forced labor on us. Now, therefore, lighten the harsh rule of your father and the heavy burden he placed on us, and we will be your loyal subjects.”
1 Kings 12:5 Rehoboam replied to them: “Go away for three days, and then return to me for my decision.” So the people left.
1 Kings 12:6 King Rehoboam then consulted with the elders, his oldest advisors, who had served before his father Solomon when he was still alive. He asked: “What counsel do you give me, that I may respond to these people?”
1 Kings 12:7 They replied to him: “If today you are a servant to these people, and serve them well, and speak kind words to them, then they will be loyal subjects to you for all of your days.”
1 Kings 12:8 But Rehoboam rejected the counsel of the elders, which they had given him. Instead, he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him and were now his closest companions.
1 Kings 12:9 He said to them: “What counsel do you give, or what should we answer to these people who have spoken to me, saying: ‘Take away from us the heavy burden that your father imposed on us’?”
1 Kings 12:10 The young men who had grown up with him replied to him, saying: “This is how you should speak to these people who have said to you: ‘Your father made our burden heavy, but you should lighten it for us.’ This is what you should say to them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.’ This means that I am even stronger and more demanding than he was.”
1 Kings 12:11 “Now, my father placed a heavy burden on you, but I will add to your burden. My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions—a much harsher instrument.”
1 Kings 12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had instructed, saying: “Return to me on the third day.”
1 Kings 12:13 And the king gave the people a harsh answer, ignoring the wise counsel that the elders had given him.
1 Kings 12:14 He spoke according to the counsel of the young men, saying: “My father made your burden heavy, but I will add even more to your burden. My father beat you with whips, but I will truly beat you with scorpions.”
1 Kings 12:15 The king did not listen to the people because the Lord had turned him away from doing so. This was to fulfill His word, which He had spoken through His prophet Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.
1 Kings 12:16 So when all of Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying: “What share do we have in David's lineage? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse! To your tents, O Israel! Now, let David—that is, Rehoboam, and the house of Judah—look to his own household!” So Israel departed to their tents, that is, to their homes.
1 Kings 12:17 But Rehoboam continued to reign over the sons of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.
1 Kings 12:18 King Rehoboam then sent Adoram, who was in charge of collecting the forced labor tribute. But all the people of Israel stoned him with rocks, and he died. King Rehoboam, for his part, quickly mounted his chariot and fled to Jerusalem.
1 Kings 12:19 Thus, Israel—meaning the ten northern tribes—separated from the house of David's dynasty and the tribe of Judah, a division that remains to this very day.
1 Kings 12:20 Now, when all of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned from Egypt, they sent for him and called him to a general assembly. They then made him king over all of Israel, with only the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin remaining loyal to Rehoboam.
1 Kings 12:21 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—a force of one hundred eighty thousand chosen warriors—intending to wage war against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to himself.
1 Kings 12:22 But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, a man of God, saying:
1 Kings 12:23 “Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, the king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying:”
1 Kings 12:24 “Thus says the Lord: You shall not go up, nor shall you fight against your brothers, the sons of Israel. Let each one return to his own house, for this word, this division, has been brought about by My will.” Hearing the word of the Lord, they turned back from their journey and went away according to the Lord’s command.
1 Kings 12:25 Jeroboam then built up the city of Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim and lived there. After leaving there, he also built up the city of Penuel.
1 Kings 12:26 Jeroboam said in his heart, that is, to himself: “Now the kingdom will certainly return its loyalty to the house of David, the family of Rehoboam.”
1 Kings 12:27 “If these people continue to go up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord, then the hearts of these people will turn back to their Lord, Rehoboam, the king of Judah. They will kill me and return to Rehoboam, the king of Judah.”
1 Kings 12:28 So, after careful consideration, Jeroboam made two golden calves and said to the people: “You have been going up to Jerusalem for too long. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!” This was an idolatrous reference to the golden calf made at Sinai.
1 Kings 12:29 He placed one golden calf in Bethel, and the other in Dan, establishing new worship centers at the northern and southern extremes of his kingdom.
1 Kings 12:30 And this action became a great sin, for the people went to worship the golden calf even as far as Dan.
1 Kings 12:31 He also built temples on high places, and appointed priests from among all the people, even those who were not from the tribe of Levi, which was against God’s law.
1 Kings 12:32 Jeroboam instituted a feast day in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, corresponding to the feast day that was celebrated in Judah. He went up to the altar himself, just as he did in Bethel, to offer sacrifice to the calves he had made. He also appointed priests for the high places he had made in Bethel.
1 Kings 12:33 He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month—a month he had arbitrarily chosen for himself, not one appointed by God. He instituted this feast for the sons of Israel and went up to the altar to burn incense.
1 Kings 12:34 Therefore, according to this word, this was done, and on that day, he went up to the altar to burn incense.
1 Kings 13:1 A man of God came from Judah to Bethel, commissioned by the Lord to deliver a message. He arrived just as King Jeroboam was standing before his altar, offering sacrifices to his false gods.
1 Kings 13:2 The man of God then cried out against the altar, speaking a message directly from the Lord. He declared: 'Altar, altar! This is what the Lord says: Listen! A son will be born to the house of David, named Josiah, who will slaughter the priests of the high places—the very priests who are now burning incense on you—and he will burn human bones upon you in desecration.'
1 Kings 13:3 And on that very day, the man of God gave a sign to prove the prophecy, saying: 'This is the sign that the Lord has truly spoken this: Watch! The altar will be split apart, and all the ashes on it will be scattered and spilled.'
1 Kings 13:4 When King Jeroboam heard the man of God's message, which was cried out against the altar in Bethel, the king stretched out his hand from the altar and commanded: 'Seize him!' But at that instant, the hand he had stretched out withered, and he could not pull it back to himself.
1 Kings 13:5 Also, at that very moment, the altar itself was split apart, and the ashes were spilled from it, just as the man of God had declared as a sign by the word of the Lord.
1 Kings 13:6 Then the king said to the man of God: 'Please, pray to the Lord your God for mercy, and intercede for me, so that my hand may be restored to me.' The man of God earnestly prayed to the Lord, and the king’s hand was restored to him, becoming as it was before.
1 Kings 13:7 The king then spoke to the man of God: 'Come home with me so you can eat and refresh yourself, and I will give you gifts as a reward.'
1 Kings 13:8 But the man of God answered the king: 'Even if you were to give me half of your royal house, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this specific place of idolatry.'
1 Kings 13:9 'For the Lord specifically commanded me in His word, saying: “You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor shall you return by the same way you came.”'
1 Kings 13:10 So he departed by another road, and did not return by the same way he had come to Bethel.
1 Kings 13:11 Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel. His son came and told his father all the works the man of God had performed that day in Bethel, and they recounted to their father the words he had spoken to the king.
1 Kings 13:12 And their father asked them, saying: 'Which way did he go?' His sons showed him the road by which the man of God, who had come from Judah, had departed.
1 Kings 13:13 Then he told his sons: 'Saddle the donkey for me.' When they had saddled it, the old prophet mounted it.
1 Kings 13:14 He went after the man of God and found him sitting under a terebinth tree. He said to him: 'Are you the man of God who came from Judah?' The man of God replied: 'I am he.'
1 Kings 13:15 Then the old prophet said to him: 'Come home with me, so you can eat bread.'
1 Kings 13:16 But the man of God replied: 'I cannot return with you, nor can I come with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this particular place, as it is forbidden by the Lord.'
1 Kings 13:17 'For the Lord spoke to me by His word, commanding: “You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor shall you return by the way you came.”'
1 Kings 13:18 Then the old prophet said to him: 'I too am a prophet like you, and an Angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying: “Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.”' However, the old prophet was lying to him.
1 Kings 13:19 So the man of God turned back with the old prophet, and he ate bread in the old prophet's house and drank water.
1 Kings 13:20 While they were sitting at the table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back.
1 Kings 13:21 And the old prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, saying: 'This is what the Lord says: Because you did not obey the command of the Lord, and did not keep the instruction that the Lord your God commanded you,'
1 Kings 13:22 'and instead you returned to eat bread and drink water in the very place where I commanded you not to eat bread or drink water, therefore your dead body shall not be brought to the tomb of your fathers for burial.'
1 Kings 13:23 After the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the old prophet saddled his own donkey for the man of God whom he had brought back.
1 Kings 13:24 As the man of God went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him. His body lay cast out on the road, with his donkey standing beside it, and the lion also stood by the dead body, not harming the donkey.
1 Kings 13:25 Then, behold, men passing by saw the body lying on the road and the lion standing beside it. They went and reported what they saw in the city where the old prophet lived.
1 Kings 13:26 When the old prophet, who had brought the man of God back from the road, heard this, he said: 'It is the man of God who did not believe the word of the Lord! So the Lord delivered him to a lion, and it crushed him and killed him, just as the Lord had spoken through His own word to him.'
1 Kings 13:27 Then he said to his sons: 'Saddle the donkey for me.' When they had saddled it, he mounted it.
1 Kings 13:28 He went and found the man of God's body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion still standing by the body. The lion had not eaten from the body, nor had it harmed the donkey, which was a miraculous sign of God's direct involvement.
1 Kings 13:29 So the old prophet picked up the body of the man of God, placed it upon his donkey, and brought him back to his own city. The old prophet then mourned for him.
1 Kings 13:30 He laid the man of God’s body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him, crying: 'Alas, my brother!'
1 Kings 13:31 After they had mourned him, the old prophet said to his sons, telling them: 'When I die, bury me in this same tomb where the man of God is buried. Place my bones beside his bones.'
1 Kings 13:32 'For the word of the Lord that he spoke by the Lord's command against the altar in Bethel, and against all the shrines of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, will surely come true.'
1 Kings 13:33 Even after these events, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way. Instead, he continued to appoint priests for the high places from the lowest ranks of the people. Whoever desired it, he consecrated them to serve, and they became priests of the high places, which was a grave sin against God.
1 Kings 13:34 Because of this sin, this became the cause of the downfall of Jeroboam’s house, leading to its complete destruction and utter removal from the face of the earth.

1 Kings 13:1 And behold, a man of God from Judah arrived in Bethel with a message from the Lord. This happened while King Jeroboam was standing at the altar to offer sacrifice.
1 Kings 13:2 And the man of God cried out against the altar with a message from the Lord, saying: "O Altar, O Altar, this is what the Lord says: 'Behold, a son will be born to the house of David, named Josiah. He will sacrifice upon you the priests of the high places who are now offering sacrifices on you, and he will burn the bones of men upon you.'"
1 Kings 13:3 And on that same day, the man of God gave a sign, saying: "This will be the proof that the Lord has spoken: 'Behold, this very altar will be torn apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.'"
1 Kings 13:4 Now, when the king heard the message of the man of God, which he had cried out against the altar in Bethel, King Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, ordering: "Seize him!" But his hand, which he had stretched out against the man of God, immediately withered, and he was unable to pull it back to himself.
1 Kings 13:5 Furthermore, the altar itself was torn apart, and the ashes were poured out from it, exactly as the man of God had prophesied with a message from the Lord.
1 Kings 13:6 Then the king said to the man of God: "Please intercede with the Lord your God and pray for me, so that my hand may be restored to me." So the man of God interceded with the Lord, and the king's hand was restored to him, becoming as it had been before.
1 Kings 13:7 The king then spoke to the man of God, inviting him: "Come home with me to eat a meal, and I will give you gifts."
1 Kings 13:8 But the man of God replied to the king: "Even if you were to give me half of your royal house, I would not go with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water in this place."
1 Kings 13:9 For this is the commandment I received in a message from the Lord, who said: 'You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same road you came.'"
1 Kings 13:10 So the man of God departed by a different road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
1 Kings 13:11 Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel. His sons came to him and told him all the deeds that the man of God had performed that day in Bethel, and they recounted to their father the words he had spoken to the king.
1 Kings 13:12 Their father then asked them: "Which road did he take?" And his sons showed him the road by which the man of God, who had come from Judah, had departed.
1 Kings 13:13 And he said to his sons: "Saddle a donkey for me." When they had saddled it, the old prophet mounted the donkey.
1 Kings 13:14 He rode after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree. The old prophet asked him: "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" And the man of God replied: "I am."
1 Kings 13:15 Then the old prophet said to him: "Come home with me to eat bread."
1 Kings 13:16 But the man of God replied: "I cannot return or go with you. I will not eat bread or drink water in this place."
1 Kings 13:17 Because the Lord spoke to me in a message, saying: 'You shall not eat bread or drink water there, nor shall you return by the way you came.'"
1 Kings 13:18 And the old prophet said to him: "I too am a prophet like you, and an Angel spoke to me with a message from the Lord, saying: 'Bring him back with you to your house, so he may eat bread and drink water.'" The old prophet was lying to him.
1 Kings 13:19 So the man of God returned with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
1 Kings 13:20 While they were sitting at the table, a message from the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back.
1 Kings 13:21 And the old prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, saying: "This is what the Lord says: 'Because you did not obey the word of the Lord, and did not keep the commandment that the Lord your God commanded you,"
1 Kings 13:22 —but instead you returned and ate bread and drank water in the very place where I commanded you not to eat bread or drink water—therefore your corpse shall not be brought into the tomb of your fathers.'"
1 Kings 13:23 Now it happened that after the man of God had eaten bread and drunk water, the old prophet saddled his own donkey for the man of God whom he had brought back.
1 Kings 13:24 When the man of God departed, a lion found him on the road and killed him. His corpse lay cast out on the road, with his donkey standing beside it, and the lion also stood beside the corpse.
1 Kings 13:25 And behold, some men passing by saw the corpse lying on the road and the lion standing next to it. They came and reported what they saw in the city where the old prophet lived.
1 Kings 13:26 When the old prophet who had brought him back from the road heard this, he said: "It is the man of God who did not obey the Lord's command! And the Lord delivered him to the lion, and it tore him and killed him, just as the Lord had spoken to him in His message."
1 Kings 13:27 And he said to his sons: "Saddle a donkey for me." When they had saddled it,
1 Kings 13:28 The old prophet went and found the corpse of the man of God lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion still standing beside the corpse. The lion had not eaten from the corpse, nor had it harmed the donkey.
1 Kings 13:29 So the old prophet picked up the corpse of the man of God and placed it upon the donkey and brought it back. He came to the city where the old prophet lived to mourn for him and to bury him.
1 Kings 13:30 And he laid the man of God's corpse in his own tomb, and they mourned over him, crying: "Alas, my brother!"
1 Kings 13:31 And it came to pass after he had buried him, the old prophet said to his sons, instructing them: "When I die, bury me in this very tomb where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones."
1 Kings 13:32 For truly the message will come to pass which he spoke with a message from the Lord, against the altar that is in Bethel, and against all the shrines of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria."
1 Kings 13:33 After these events, King Jeroboam did not turn back from his evil way. Instead, he continued to appoint priests for the high places from the lowest of the people; anyone who desired it could consecrate himself and become a priest of the high places.
1 Kings 13:34 And because of this cause, the house of Jeroboam sinned, and it was utterly destroyed and wiped from the face of the earth.
1 Kings 14:1 At that particular time, Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, became sick.
1 Kings 14:2 Jeroboam then told his wife, "Get up and change your clothes, so no one will recognize that you are Jeroboam's wife. Then go to Shiloh, where Ahijah the prophet lives—the same man who told me that I would rule over these people of Israel."
1 Kings 14:3 "Take with you five loaves of bread, a cake, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy—your son."
1 Kings 14:4 So Jeroboam's wife did as she was told. She arose, went to Shiloh, and arrived at Ahijah's house. But Ahijah could not see, because his eyes were dim with old age.
1 Kings 14:5 But the Lord had spoken to Ahijah, saying, "Look, Jeroboam's wife is coming to consult you about her son, because he is sick. You are to tell her exactly these things." So when she entered and pretended to be someone else,
1 Kings 14:6 Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came through the door, and he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another woman? I, however, am sent on a mission to you with a harsh message from God."
1 Kings 14:7 "Go and tell Jeroboam: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: For as much as I exalted you from among the people, and made you a leader over My people Israel—"
1 Kings 14:8 "—and I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. Yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with his whole heart, doing only what was pleasing in My eyes."
1 Kings 14:9 "But you have done worse evil than all who were before you. You have made for yourself foreign gods, and molten images, to provoke Me to anger, and you have cast Me aside, behind your back."
1 Kings 14:10 "Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every male—every male, whether confined or completely free in Israel. I will utterly cleanse the remnant of Jeroboam's house, just as one cleanses dung until it is completely gone."
1 Kings 14:11 "Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, dogs will devour him. And anyone who dies in the open country, the birds of the sky will eat him. For the Lord Himself has spoken it."
1 Kings 14:12 "You, therefore, rise up and go to your house. And the very moment your feet enter the city, the boy will die."
1 Kings 14:13 "And all Israel will mourn for him, and they will bury him. For he alone among all of Jeroboam's family will be brought to a burial place, because some good was found in him towards the Lord, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam."
1 Kings 14:14 "Furthermore, the Lord will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will utterly cut off the house of Jeroboam, and that will happen on this very day and at this very time."
1 Kings 14:15 "And the Lord will strike Israel, causing them to sway like a reed that is moved by water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave to their fathers, and He will scatter them beyond the River Euphrates, because they made for themselves Asherah poles to provoke the Lord to anger."
1 Kings 14:16 "And the Lord will abandon Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and caused Israel to sin."
1 Kings 14:17 So Jeroboam's wife arose and departed. She came to Tirzah, and as she was crossing the threshold of the house, the boy died.
1 Kings 14:18 They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, just as the Lord had spoken through His servant Ahijah the prophet.
1 Kings 14:19 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1 Kings 14:20 The days that Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years. Then he slept with his fathers—a euphemism for dying. And Nadab, his son, reigned in his place.
1 Kings 14:21 Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name there. Now his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
1 Kings 14:22 And Judah did evil before the Lord. They provoked Him to jealousy with all the sins that their fathers had committed.
1 Kings 14:23 For they also built for themselves high places, and sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every leafy tree.
1 Kings 14:24 Furthermore, there were male cult prostitutes in the land, and they committed all the abominable practices of the nations that the Lord had driven out before the children of Israel.
1 Kings 14:25 Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, marched against Jerusalem.
1 Kings 14:26 And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house. He plundered everything, including the golden shields that Solomon had made.
1 Kings 14:27 In place of these, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard, who stood watch at the entrance of the king's house.
1 Kings 14:28 And whenever the king entered the house of the Lord, the guards carried them, and then they returned them to the guardroom of the shield-bearers.
1 Kings 14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah.
1 Kings 14:30 There was also continuous warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout all their days.
1 Kings 14:31 Then Rehoboam slept with his fathers—he died—and was buried with them in the city of David. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. And Abijah, his son, reigned in his place.
1 Kings 14:1 At that time, Abijah, who was the son of King Jeroboam, fell ill.
1 Kings 14:2 And King Jeroboam said to his wife: "Go now, and disguise yourself by changing your clothes, so no one will recognize that you are the wife of King Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh, where Ahijah the prophet lives—the same prophet who told me I would be king over this people."
1 Kings 14:3 "Also, take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey. Go to him, and he will tell you what will happen to the boy."
1 Kings 14:4 So King Jeroboam's wife did as he had told her. She got up and went to Shiloh, and came to Ahijah's house. But the prophet could not see, because his eyes had become dim from old age.
1 Kings 14:5 But the Lord had said to Ahijah: "Look, King Jeroboam's wife is coming to consult you about her son, who is sick. Tell her exactly these things." So when she came in, pretending to be someone else,
1 Kings 14:6 Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she entered through the door, and he said: "Come in, wife of King Jeroboam! Why are you pretending to be someone you are not? I have been sent to you with a harsh message."
1 Kings 14:7 "Go and tell King Jeroboam: 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says: I elevated you from among the common people and made you a leader over My people, Israel."
1 Kings 14:8 'I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. Yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with his whole heart, doing only what was pleasing in My sight.
1 Kings 14:9 'Instead, you have done more evil than all who were before you. You have made for yourself foreign gods, idols cast from metal, to provoke My wrath, and you have cast Me aside, forgetting about Me completely.
1 Kings 14:10 'Therefore, behold, I will bring disaster upon the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every male descendant, whether slave or free, the lowest and the last in Israel. I will utterly sweep away the remnant of Jeroboam's house, just as one sweeps away dung until it is completely gone.'
1 Kings 14:11 'Those of Jeroboam's family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the open country will be devoured by the birds of the sky. This is because the Lord Himself has spoken it.'"
1 Kings 14:12 Ahijah continued, "As for you, get up and go back to your house. The very moment your feet enter the city, the boy will die."
1 Kings 14:13 "All of Israel will mourn him and bury him. For he alone among Jeroboam's family will be laid in a proper grave, because in him alone, in the house of Jeroboam, a good word concerning the Lord God of Israel was found."
1 Kings 14:14 "Moreover, the Lord will raise up a king over Israel for Himself, who will cut off the house of Jeroboam—and this will happen quickly, at the appointed time."
1 Kings 14:15 "And the Lord will strike Israel, shaking them like a reed is shaken in water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave to their ancestors, and scatter them beyond the great river, because they made for themselves sacred poles, provoking the Lord to anger."
1 Kings 14:16 "And the Lord will abandon Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and led Israel into sin."
1 Kings 14:17 So Jeroboam's wife got up and left, and came to Tirzah. And as she stepped across the threshold of the house, the boy died.
1 Kings 14:18 They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, just as the Lord had declared through His servant, Ahijah the prophet.
1 Kings 14:19 Now, the rest of the acts of Jeroboam—how he fought wars and how he reigned—behold, these are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1 Kings 14:20 The length of King Jeroboam's reign was twenty-two years. He then died and was laid to rest with his ancestors, and his son Nadab reigned in his place.
1 Kings 14:21 Rehoboam, Solomon's son, was ruling in Judah at this time. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to establish His presence there. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman.
1 Kings 14:22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him more than all that their ancestors had done through the sins they committed.
1 Kings 14:23 For they also built for themselves high places, pillars, and sacred groves upon every high hill and under every lush tree, engaging in idolatry.
1 Kings 14:24 Moreover, there were also male prostitutes for cultic purposes in the land, and they committed all the detestable practices of the pagan nations whom the Lord had driven out before the people of Israel.
1 Kings 14:25 Now, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, Shishak king of Egypt marched up against Jerusalem.
1 Kings 14:26 He carried off the treasures of the Lord's house and the treasures of the royal palace. He plundered everything, including the golden shields that King Solomon had made.
1 Kings 14:27 In place of these, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guards, who protected the entrance of the royal palace.
1 Kings 14:28 And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the guards who walked before him would carry these shields, and then return them to the guardroom.
1 Kings 14:29 Now, the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1 Kings 14:30 There was continuous warfare between King Rehoboam and King Jeroboam throughout all their days.
1 Kings 14:31 And Rehoboam died and was laid to rest with his ancestors in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman. And his son Abijam reigned in his place.
1 Kings 14:1 At that time—while Jeroboam was reigning as king—his son, Abijah, became very ill.
1 Kings 14:2 And King Jeroboam said to his wife, "Get up, change your clothing so that no one will recognize that you are the queen, King Jeroboam's wife. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet lives there—he's the one who told me that I would be king over this people, Israel."
1 Kings 14:3 "Take ten loaves of bread with you, along with some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the child."
1 Kings 14:4 So Jeroboam's wife did as her husband instructed. She got up, went to Shiloh, and arrived at Ahijah's house. Ahijah, however, could not see anything, because his eyes were dim and clouded due to his old age.
1 Kings 14:5 But the Lord God had already spoken to Ahijah, saying, "Look, Jeroboam's wife is coming to consult you about her son, who is sick. You are to tell her exactly this and this—all that I am about to reveal to you." So when she came in, she pretended to be someone else, to hide her identity.
1 Kings 14:6 As Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps entering through the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you pretending to be someone else? I have been sent by God to you with a harsh message for your husband."
1 Kings 14:7 "Go, and tell Jeroboam this: 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says: Because I lifted you up from among the common people and made you a leader over My people Israel—"
1 Kings 14:8 "—and I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was pleasing in My sight—"
1 Kings 14:9 "—instead, you have done more evil than all who were before you. You have made other, false gods for yourself, and molten images, simply to provoke Me to anger. You have completely cast Me behind your back, disregarding My authority and My Law."
1 Kings 14:10 "Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every male, whether slave or free, even the last remaining one in Israel. I will thoroughly cleanse the remnants of Jeroboam's house, just as one cleans away dung until nothing is left."
1 Kings 14:11 "Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs. And anyone of his family who dies in the open country will be devoured by the birds of the sky. This will happen because the Lord God Himself has spoken it."
1 Kings 14:12 "So you, get up and go to your house. The very moment your feet enter the city, the boy, your son, will die."
1 Kings 14:13 "All of Israel will mourn for him, and they will bury him with honor. For of all Jeroboam's family, only this child will be brought to a proper burial, because in him alone was found some good intention toward the Lord God of Israel, even within the wicked house of Jeroboam."
1 Kings 14:14 "Moreover, the Lord God will raise up for Himself a new king over Israel, who will completely cut off the house of Jeroboam—this will happen on that very day, at that very moment."
1 Kings 14:15 "And the Lord God will strike Israel, causing them to tremble and shake like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave to their fathers, and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they have made sacred groves and Asherah poles—symbols of idolatry—to provoke the Lord God to anger."
1 Kings 14:16 "The Lord God will abandon Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who himself sinned, and who also caused all of Israel to sin."
1 Kings 14:17 So Jeroboam's wife got up and left, and she came to Tirzah. And as she stepped over the threshold of her house, the boy died—just as the prophet had foretold.
1 Kings 14:18 They buried him, and all of Israel mourned for him, exactly as the Lord God had spoken through His servant, Ahijah the prophet.
1 Kings 14:19 The rest of the acts of Jeroboam—how he fought wars and how he reigned as king—behold, they are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel.
1 Kings 14:20 The days during which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years. Then he rested with his fathers—that is, he died and was buried. And his son, Nadab, began to reign in his place.
1 Kings 14:21 Now Rehoboam, Solomon's son, reigned over Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord God had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to establish His Name there, as a place of true worship. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
1 Kings 14:22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord God. They provoked Him to anger even more than all the sins their fathers had committed, through their own sins and their fervent idolatry.
1 Kings 14:23 For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles for false worship upon every high hill and under every lush, green tree.
1 Kings 14:24 There were also male cult prostitutes, referred to as 'sodomites' by their pagan practices, in the land. They committed all the abominations of the pagan nations whom the Lord God had driven out from before the children of Israel.
1 Kings 14:25 Now, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, marched against Jerusalem.
1 Kings 14:26 He plundered the treasures of the house of the Lord God, and the royal palace treasures, and he carried off everything. He even took away the golden shields that King Solomon had made.
1 Kings 14:27 In place of the golden shields, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the care of the captains of the guard, who protected the entrance of the royal palace.
1 Kings 14:28 Whenever the king would go into the house of the Lord God, the guards would carry the bronze shields before him, and then they would return them to the guardroom.
1 Kings 14:29 The rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah.
1 Kings 14:30 And there was continuous warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout all their days.
1 Kings 14:31 Then Rehoboam rested with his fathers—meaning, he died and was buried with them in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. And his son, Abijam, began to reign in his place.
1 Kings 15:1 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, Abiam began his reign over the kingdom of Judah.
1 Kings 15:2 He reigned in Jerusalem for three years. His mother's name was Maacha, and she was the daughter of Absalom.
1 Kings 15:3 Abiam persisted in all the sins that his father had committed before him. His heart was not entirely dedicated to the Lord his God, unlike the heart of his ancestor, King David.
1 Kings 15:4 Nevertheless, because of His servant David, the Lord his God granted Abiam a lasting dynasty in Jerusalem, so that He would raise up a son to succeed him and ensure that Jerusalem remained steadfast.
1 Kings 15:5 This was because David had done what was right in the sight of the Lord God and had not turned aside from anything the Lord had commanded him all the days of his life, with the single exception of the matter involving Urias the Hethite.
1 Kings 15:6 There was continuous warfare between Roboam, Abiam's father, and Jeroboam throughout all their days.
1 Kings 15:7 As for the rest of Abiam's acts and all that he did, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? There was also ongoing war between Abiam and Jeroboam.
1 Kings 15:8 Abiam died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. Then his son Asa became king in his place.
1 Kings 15:9 In the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Asa began to reign as king over Judah.
1 Kings 15:10 He reigned for forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacha, the daughter of Absalom.
1 Kings 15:11 Asa did what was right in the sight of the Lord God, just as his ancestor David had done.
1 Kings 15:12 He expelled the male cult prostitutes from the land and purified Judah of all the abominable idols that his ancestors had made.
1 Kings 15:13 Furthermore, he even removed his queen mother Maacha from her position of authority because she had made a most abominable idol in a sacred grove. Asa cut down this idol and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
1 Kings 15:14 However, he did not remove the high places, the unauthorized altars for worship. Nevertheless, Asa's heart was entirely devoted to the Lord God throughout his entire life.
1 Kings 15:15 Asa also brought into the house of the Lord the silver, gold, and vessels that his father had consecrated through vows, as well as those he himself had consecrated.
1 Kings 15:16 There was continuous warfare between Asa and Baasa, the king of Israel, throughout their reigns.
1 Kings 15:17 Baasa, the king of Israel, went up against Judah and fortified the city of Rama. His intention was to prevent anyone from going out or coming in from Asa's kingdom.
1 Kings 15:18 So Asa took all the remaining silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the Lord and from the royal palace's treasuries. He entrusted it to his servants and sent them with a message to Benadad, the son of Tabremon, son of Hezion, who was king of Syria and resided in Damascus. Asa's message was:
1 Kings 15:19 Let there be an alliance between you and me, just as there was between my father and your father. I have sent you a gift of silver and gold for this reason: come and break your alliance with Baasa, king of Israel, so that he will withdraw his forces from me.
1 Kings 15:20 Benadad agreed to King Asa's proposal. He sent the commanders of his army to attack the cities of Israel, striking Aion, Dan, Abeldomum Maacha, the entire region of Cineorth, and all the land of Nephthali.
1 Kings 15:21 When Baasa heard this news, he ceased fortifying Rama and returned to Thersa.
1 Kings 15:22 Then King Asa issued a proclamation throughout all Judah, commanding that no one was to be excused from participating. They dismantled the stones and timbers from Rama, which Baasa had used for construction, and King Asa used those materials to fortify Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
1 Kings 15:23 As for the rest of Asa's acts, his full strength, all that he accomplished, and the cities he built, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? However, in his old age, he suffered from a severe disease in his feet.
1 Kings 15:24 Asa died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, his forefather. Then his son Josaphat became king in his place.
1 Kings 15:25 Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, began to reign over Israel in the second year of King Asa's reign over Judah. He reigned over Israel for two years.
1 Kings 15:26 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord God. He walked in the sinful ways of his father Jeroboam and perpetuated the sins by which his father had caused Israel to fall into idolatry.
1 Kings 15:27 Baasa, the son of Ahia, from the tribe of Issachar, conspired against Nadab and struck him down in Gebbethon, a city belonging to the Philistines. At that time, Nadab and all of Israel were besieging Gebbethon.
1 Kings 15:28 So Baasa killed Nadab in the third year of King Asa's reign over Judah and became king in his place.
1 Kings 15:29 Once Baasa became king, he struck down the entire household of Jeroboam. He did not leave alive a single member of Jeroboam's lineage until he had utterly destroyed them all. This was in fulfillment of the word of the Lord God, which He had spoken through His servant Ahia the Shilonite.
1 Kings 15:30 This destruction came about because of the sins Jeroboam had committed, and by which he had caused Israel to sin, and because of the great anger with which he had provoked the Lord God of Israel.
1 Kings 15:31 As for the rest of Nadab's acts and all that he accomplished, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings 15:32 There was continuous warfare between Asa and Baasa, the king of Israel, throughout their reigns.
1 Kings 15:33 In the third year of King Asa's reign over Judah, Baasa, the son of Ahia, began to reign over all Israel from Thersa. He reigned for twenty-four years.
1 Kings 15:34 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord God, walking in the sinful ways of Jeroboam and perpetuating the sins by which Jeroboam had caused Israel to fall into idolatry.
1 Kings 15:1 In the eighteenth year that Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, was king, Abiam began his reign over Judah.
1 Kings 15:2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacha, daughter of Abessalom.
1 Kings 15:3 He followed all the sinful ways that his father had established before him. His heart was not completely faithful to the Lord his God, unlike the heart of his ancestor David.
1 Kings 15:4 But because of David, His servant, the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem—meaning He allowed his lineage to continue after him, ensuring Jerusalem's stability.
1 Kings 15:5 For David had done what was right in the eyes of the Lord and had not turned aside from anything the Lord had commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter concerning Uriah the Hittite.
1 Kings 15:6 There was also continuous war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their lives.
1 Kings 15:7 Now, the rest of the acts of Abiam, and all that he did—are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? There was also war between Abiam and Jeroboam.
1 Kings 15:8 Abiam then rested with his ancestors—meaning he died—and they buried him in the City of David. His son Asa became king in his place.
1 Kings 15:9 In the twentieth year that Jeroboam was king of Israel, Asa began his reign as king of Judah.
1 Kings 15:10 He reigned for forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacha, daughter of Abessalom —this refers to his queen mother, who was his grandmother.
1 Kings 15:11 Asa did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his ancestor David had done.
1 Kings 15:12 He expelled the male cult prostitutes from the land and purified it from all the filthy idols that his ancestors had made.
1 Kings 15:13 Moreover, he removed Maacha, his own queen mother, from her position of power concerning the sacred rites, because she had made an abominable idol for the Asherah grove. Asa then cut down her idol and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
1 Kings 15:14 However, he did not remove the high places of worship. Nevertheless, Asa's heart was completely faithful to the Lord throughout all his days.
1 Kings 15:15 He brought into the House of the Lord the silver, gold, and sacred vessels that his father had consecrated, along with his own consecrated gifts.
1 Kings 15:16 But there was constant warfare between Asa and Baasha, the king of Israel, throughout their lives.
1 Kings 15:17 Baasha, the king of Israel, marched against Judah and began to fortify Ramah, intending to prevent anyone from leaving or entering Asa's kingdom.
1 Kings 15:18 So Asa took all the silver and gold that remained in the treasuries of the House of the Lord and in the king's treasuries. He sent it by the hand of his servants to Ben-Hadad, son of Tabremon, son of Hezion, the king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying:
1 Kings 15:19 There is a treaty between me and you, just as there was between my ancestor and your ancestor. Therefore, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold. Come, break your alliance with Baasha, the king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.
1 Kings 15:20 Ben-Hadad agreed to King Asa's request and sent the commanders of his army against the cities of Israel. He attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-Beth-Maachah, and all of Chinneroth, along with the entire land of Naphtali.
1 Kings 15:21 When Baasha heard of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and returned to Tirzah.
1 Kings 15:22 King Asa then summoned all of Judah, leaving no one behind. They carried away the stones and timber from Ramah that Baasha had been using for construction. King Asa then used these materials to fortify Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.
1 Kings 15:23 Now, the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built—are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah? However, in the time of his old age, he suffered from a severe foot disease.
1 Kings 15:24 Asa then rested with his ancestors—meaning he died—and was buried with them in the City of David, his ancestor. His son Jehoshaphat became king in his place.
1 Kings 15:25 Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, became king over Israel in the second year of King Asa of Judah. He reigned over Israel for two years.
1 Kings 15:26 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of his father, and in the sins by which he had caused Israel to sin.
1 Kings 15:27 Baasha, the son of Ahijah, from the house of Issachar, conspired against him. Baasha struck him down in Gibbethon, a city belonging to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were at that time besieging Gibbethon.
1 Kings 15:28 So Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of King Asa of Judah and became king in his place.
1 Kings 15:29 When Baasha began his reign, he struck down everyone in the house of Jeroboam. He did not leave a single living soul until he had utterly destroyed them all, according to the word of the Lord which He had spoken through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite.
1 Kings 15:30 This was because of Jeroboam's sins, which he had committed and by which he had led Israel into sin. It was also because of the offense by which he had provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger.
1 Kings 15:31 Now, the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did—are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings 15:32 There was also continuous warfare between Asa and Baasha, the king of Israel, throughout their lives.
1 Kings 15:33 In the third year of King Asa of Judah, Baasha, the son of Ahijah, began his reign over all Israel in Tirzah. He reigned for twenty-four years.
1 Kings 15:34 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of Jeroboam, and in the sins by which he had caused Israel to sin.
1 Kings 15:35 Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu, the son of Hanani, concerning Baasha, saying:
1 Kings 15:36 Because I elevated you from the dust and appointed you as leader over My people Israel, yet you walked in the ways of Jeroboam and caused My people Israel to sin, provoking Me to anger with their sins:
1 Kings 15:37 Behold, I will utterly sweep away the descendants of Baasha and the descendants of his house. I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.
1 Kings 15:38 Whoever belonging to Baasha dies in the city, dogs will devour him; and whoever belonging to him dies in the open country, the birds of the sky will consume him.
1 Kings 15:39 Now, the rest of the acts of Baasha, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds—are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings 15:40 Baasha then rested with his ancestors—meaning he died—and was buried in Tirzah. His son Elah became king in his place.
1 Kings 16:1 Therefore, the Lord God gave His message to Jehu, the son of Hanani, a prophet, directly against King Baasha, saying:
1 Kings 16:2 “I raised you up from nothing, and I made you the ruler over My people, Israel. But you have behaved exactly like King Jeroboam.
1 Kings 16:3 You have caused My people, Israel, to sin, and you have provoked My anger with their sins. Because of this, I will utterly wipe out Baasha and his entire family line.
1 Kings 16:4 I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. Those who die from Baasha’s family in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by the birds of the sky.”
1 Kings 16:5 All the other events concerning King Baasha, everything he did, and all his battles — these are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
1 Kings 16:6 So Baasha died and was buried in Tirzah. Then his son, Ela, became king after him.
1 Kings 16:7 Indeed, the Lord’s message had come through the prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, against Baasha and his household. This was because of all the evil he had done in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, making his house become like the house of Jeroboam. For this very reason, Jehu, the son of Hanani the prophet, had struck him down.
1 Kings 16:8 In the twenty-sixth year of King Asa’s reign in Judah, Ela, the son of Baasha, began to reign over Israel in Tirzah. He reigned for two years.
1 Kings 16:9 Then Zambri, one of his officials who commanded half his chariots, conspired against him. One day, Ela was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arsa, who was in charge of the palace there.
1 Kings 16:10 Zambri entered and struck him down, killing him. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. Then Zambri became king in Ela’s place.
1 Kings 16:11 As soon as Zambri began to reign and was seated on Ela’s throne, he wiped out Baasha’s entire family line. He left no male alive, nor any of his relatives or friends.
1 Kings 16:12 So Zambri destroyed Baasha’s entire family, exactly as the Lord God had spoken to Baasha through the prophet Jehu.
1 Kings 16:13 This was for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of his son Ela. They had sinned and had led Israel into sin, provoking the Lord God of Israel with their empty idols.
1 Kings 16:14 All the other events concerning King Ela and everything he did — these are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
1 Kings 16:15 In the twenty-seventh year of King Asa’s reign in Judah, Zambri reigned for seven days in Tirzah. At this time, the Israelite army was besieging Gibbethon, a city belonging to the Philistines.
1 Kings 16:16 When the army and all Israel heard that Zambri had rebelled and had killed the king, all Israel proclaimed Amri, the commander of the army, as their king right there in the camp on that very day.
1 Kings 16:17 So Amri and all Israel with him marched up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah.
1 Kings 16:18 When Zambri saw that the city was about to be captured, he went into the royal palace. He then set fire to the palace and burned himself to death inside it.
1 Kings 16:19 He died because of the sins he had committed. He had done evil in the sight of the Lord, following the path of Jeroboam and the sins by which Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin.
1 Kings 16:20 All the other events concerning King Zambri and his conspiracy — these are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
1 Kings 16:21 At that time, the people of Israel were divided into two factions. One half of the people followed Thebni, the son of Gyneth, wanting him to be king, while the other half followed Amri.
1 Kings 16:22 However, the people supporting Amri eventually became stronger than the people supporting Thebni, son of Gyneth. So Thebni died, and Amri became the sole king.
1 Kings 16:23 In the thirty-first year of King Asa’s reign in Judah, Amri began to reign over Israel for a total of twelve years. He reigned in Tirzah for six of those years.
1 Kings 16:24 Amri bought the hill of Samaria from Semer for two talents of silver. He built a city on this hill and named the city he built Samaria, after Semer, the original owner of the hill.
1 Kings 16:25 Amri did evil in the sight of the Lord God. He acted with greater wickedness than all the kings who had been before him.
1 Kings 16:26 He walked in every way of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and in his sins by which Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin. This was so he would provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their worthless idols.
1 Kings 16:27 All the other events concerning King Amri, and the battles he fought — these are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
1 Kings 16:28 So Amri died and was buried in Samaria. Then his son, Achab, became king after him.
1 Kings 16:29 Achab, the son of Amri, began to reign over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Asa’s reign in Judah. Achab, the son of Amri, reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years.
1 Kings 16:30 Achab, the son of Amri, did even more evil in the sight of the Lord God than all the kings who had been before him.
1 Kings 16:31 It was not enough for him merely to follow in the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. Additionally, he married Jezabel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians. Then he went and served Baal, even worshipping him.
1 Kings 16:32 He even erected an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
1 Kings 16:33 He also set up a sacred pole for Asherah. Achab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who had been before him.
1 Kings 16:34 In Achab’s days, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub. This happened exactly as the Lord God had spoken through Joshua, the son of Nun, many years before.
1 Kings 16:35 
1 Kings 16:36 
1 Kings 16:37 
1 Kings 16:38 
1 Kings 16:39 
1 Kings 16:40 
1 Kings 16:1 The Lord’s message then came to Jehu, who was a prophet and the son of Hanani. This message was against Baasa, and it said:
1 Kings 16:2 “I raised you from obscurity and appointed you as leader over my people, Israel. But you followed the ways of Jeroboam, and you caused my people Israel to sin, thereby provoking My anger with your sins.
1 Kings 16:3 Behold, I will wipe out all of Baasa’s descendants and his entire household. I will make your household like that of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.
1 Kings 16:4 Anyone from Baasa’s household who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs. And anyone from his household who dies in the open country will be eaten by the birds of the sky.”
1 Kings 16:5 The rest of Baasa’s deeds, all that he accomplished, and his battles—are these not all written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16:6 Baasa then rested with his ancestors and was buried in Thirsa. Then his son Ela reigned in his place.
1 Kings 16:7 Indeed, through the prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, the Lord’s message also came against Baasa and against his household. This was because of all the evil he had done before the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the works of his own hands, so that his household would become like the household of Jeroboam. For this reason, the Lord struck him down, as declared by Jehu, the prophet and son of Hanani.
1 Kings 16:8 In the twenty-sixth year of King Asa of Judah’s reign, Ela, Baasa’s son, began to reign over Israel in Thirsa. He reigned for two years.
1 Kings 16:9 Then his servant Zamri conspired against him. Zamri was the commander of half of Ela’s chariots. Ela, meanwhile, was in Thirsa, drinking and getting drunk in the house of Arsa, who was in charge of Thirsa’s palace.
1 Kings 16:10 So Zamri rushed in, attacked, and killed Ela in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa of Judah’s reign. Then Zamri reigned in Ela’s place.
1 Kings 16:11 As soon as Zamri began to reign and was seated on Ela’s throne, he struck down Baasa’s entire household. He did not leave alive a single male from Baasa’s family, nor any of his relatives or friends.
1 Kings 16:12 So Zamri completely destroyed Baasa’s entire household, just as the Lord had declared against Baasa through the prophet Jehu.
1 Kings 16:13 This destruction was for all the sins of Baasa and the sins of his son Ela, which they committed and which they caused Israel to commit, thereby provoking the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
1 Kings 16:14 The rest of Ela’s deeds, and all that he accomplished—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16:15 In the month of Theboth, in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa of Judah’s reign, Zamri reigned for seven days in Thirsa. Meanwhile, the army of Israel was besieging Gabathon, a city of the Philistines.
1 Kings 16:16 When the people who were besieging Gabathon heard that Zamri had conspired and killed the king, all the people of Israel appointed their army commander, Amri, as king over Israel that very day.
1 Kings 16:17 So Amri and all Israel with him marched up from Gabathon and besieged Thirsa.
1 Kings 16:18 When Zamri saw that the city was about to be captured, he went into the king’s palace and set fire to himself along with the palace. Thus he died.
1 Kings 16:19 He died because of his sins, which he had committed by doing evil in the Lord’s sight, by following the way of Jeroboam, and by the sins with which he had caused Israel to sin.
1 Kings 16:20 The rest of Zamri’s deeds, his conspiracy, and his acts of tyranny—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16:21 Then the people of Israel were divided into two factions. Half of the people followed Thebni, son of Gineth, wanting him to be king, while the other half followed Amri.
1 Kings 16:22 However, Amri’s supporters proved stronger than the supporters of Thebni, son of Gineth. So Thebni died, and Amri began to reign.
1 Kings 16:23 In the thirty-first year of King Asa of Judah’s reign, Amri began to reign over Israel for twelve years. He reigned in Thirsa for six of those years.
1 Kings 16:24 He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for one hundred talents of silver. He built a city on this hill and named the city he founded Samaria, after Shemer, the original owner of the hill.
1 Kings 16:25 Amri did evil in the Lord’s sight, acting more wickedly than all who had come before him.
1 Kings 16:26 He followed the path of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and continued in his sins, which caused Israel to sin. This provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
1 Kings 16:27 The rest of Amri’s deeds, and the battles he fought—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16:28 Amri then rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. His son Achab reigned in his place.
1 Kings 16:29 Achab, Amri’s son, began to reign over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Asa of Judah’s reign. Achab, Amri’s son, reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years.
1 Kings 16:30 Achab, Amri’s son, did more evil in the Lord’s sight than all who had come before him.
1 Kings 16:31 It was not enough for him to follow the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat. Additionally, he took Jezabel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, as his wife. Then he went and served Baal and worshipped him.
1 Kings 16:32 He even built an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had constructed in Samaria.
1 Kings 16:33 Achab also made an idolatrous pole and continued to do more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who had come before him.
1 Kings 16:34 In Achab’s days, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of his firstborn son, Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son, Segub. This happened exactly as the Lord had declared through Josue, son of Nun, many years before.
1 Kings 16:1 Now, the word of the Lord came to Jehu, the son of Hanani, who was a prophet. It was a word against Baasa, saying:
1 Kings 16:2 Because I raised you up from the dust, and I appointed you as a leader over my people, Israel, yet you walked in the ways of Jeroboam. You made my people, Israel, commit sin, thus provoking me to anger with their sins.
1 Kings 16:3 Therefore, behold, I will completely sweep away Baasa's descendants, and the descendants of his household. I will make your household like the household of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.
1 Kings 16:4 Those of Baasa's family who die within the city will be devoured by dogs. And those of his family who die out in the countryside will be consumed by the birds of the sky.
1 Kings 16:5 Now, the rest of the acts of Baasa, and all that he accomplished, and his battles—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16:6 So Baasa passed away and was buried in Thersa. Then his son Ela became king in his place.
1 Kings 16:7 Indeed, it was through the hand of Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet, that the word of the Lord came against Baasa and against his household. It was against all the wickedness he had done before the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the works of his own hands—so that his house would become like the house of Jeroboam. It was for this very reason that the Lord's judgment brought about his end, as pronounced by Jehu, the son of Hanani, the prophet.
1 Kings 16:8 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa, king of Judah, Ela, the son of Baasa, began to reign over Israel in Thersa. He reigned for two years.
1 Kings 16:9 And Zambri, his servant and the captain of half his chariots, rebelled against him. Now, Ela was in Thersa, drinking excessively and indulging himself in the house of Arsa, who was the governor of Thersa.
1 Kings 16:10 Zambri went in, struck him down, and killed him. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of Judah, and then Zambri became king in Ela's place.
1 Kings 16:11 As soon as Zambri began his reign and took his seat on the throne, he struck down the entire household of Baasa. He did not leave alive a single male descendant, nor any of his relatives or friends.
1 Kings 16:12 So Zambri completely destroyed the entire household of Baasa. This was exactly according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through Jehu the prophet, against Baasa.
1 Kings 16:13 This destruction was on account of all the sins of Baasa, and the sins of his son Ela. They sinned themselves and also caused Israel to sin, provoking the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
1 Kings 16:14 Now, the rest of the acts of Ela, and all that he accomplished—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16:15 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of Judah, Zambri reigned for only seven days in Thersa. At that time, the Israelite army was besieging Gebbethon, a city of the Philistines.
1 Kings 16:16 When the army besieging the city, and all of Israel, heard that Zambri had taken the kingdom by force and had murdered the king, all of Israel, on that very day, in the military camp, appointed Omri, the commander of the army, as king over Israel.
1 Kings 16:17 So Omri, with all of Israel who were with him, marched up from Gebbethon and laid siege to Thersa.
1 Kings 16:18 When Zambri saw that the city was being captured and that he himself was about to be overcome, he went into the royal palace, to the inner citadel of the king's house. He then set the king's house on fire around himself, and he died in the flames.
1 Kings 16:19 This was due to his sins, which he committed by doing evil in the sight of the Lord. He walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin, he led Israel to sin.
1 Kings 16:20 Now, the rest of the acts of Zambri, and his conspiracy and his tyrannical rule—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16:21 At that time, the people of Israel were divided into two factions. Half of the people followed Thebni, the son of Gineth, wanting him to be king, while the other half followed Omri.
1 Kings 16:22 However, the people who were with Omri proved stronger than the people who followed Thebni, the son of Gineth. So Thebni died, and Omri began to reign.
1 Kings 16:23 In the thirty-first year of Asa, king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel. He reigned for twelve years in total, and for six of those years, he reigned in Thersa.
1 Kings 16:24 He then purchased the hill of Samaria from Semer for four hundred talents of silver. He built a city on that hill, and he named the city he had constructed Samaria, after Semer, the original owner of the hill.
1 Kings 16:25 Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord, and he acted more wickedly than all those who had been kings before him.
1 Kings 16:26 He walked in every way of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, and in the sins by which Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin. Omri did all of this to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
1 Kings 16:27 Now, the rest of the acts of Omri, and all the works he accomplished, and his battles—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings 16:28 So Omri passed away and was buried in Samaria. Then his son Achab became king in his place.
1 Kings 16:29 Achab, the son of Omri, became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa, king of Judah. Achab, the son of Omri, reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years.
1 Kings 16:30 Achab, the son of Omri, did more evil in the sight of the Lord than all the kings who had been before him.
1 Kings 16:31 It was not enough for him merely to walk in the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat. In addition, he took Jezabel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, as his wife. Then he went and served Baal, and he worshipped that false god.
1 Kings 16:32 He even erected an altar for Baal inside the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
1 Kings 16:33 He also made an Asherah pole—a pagan idol dedicated to a goddess. Achab added even more wicked deeds, surpassing all the kings of Israel who had been before him, all in order to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger.
1 Kings 16:34 In Achab's days, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of his firstborn son, Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son, Segub. This happened according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through Joshua, the son of Nun, many centuries earlier.
1 Kings 17:1 And Elijah the Tishbite, one of the settlers from Gilead, said to King Ahab: "As the Lord God of Israel lives, in whose presence I serve, there will be no dew or rain for the coming years, unless I command it by my word."
1 Kings 17:2 And the word of the Lord came to Elijah, saying:
1 Kings 17:3 "Leave this place, and go east. Hide yourself in the Cherith Ravine, which is on the eastern side of the Jordan River."
1 Kings 17:4 "And there you will drink from the ravine. I have commanded ravens to feed you there."
1 Kings 17:5 So Elijah went and did as the Lord had commanded him. He went and stayed by the Cherith Ravine, which faces the Jordan River.
1 Kings 17:6 Ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening. And he drank from the ravine.
1 Kings 17:7 And it happened after a number of days that the ravine dried up, because no rain had fallen on the land.
1 Kings 17:8 Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying:
1 Kings 17:9 "Arise and go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there. For I have commanded a widow woman there to provide for you."
1 Kings 17:10 So Elijah arose and went to Zarephath. When he came to the city gate, he saw a widow woman there gathering sticks. He called out to her and said, "Please bring me a little water in a cup, so I can drink."
1 Kings 17:11 As she was going to get it, Elijah called after her, saying, "Please, also bring me a small piece of bread with you."
1 Kings 17:12 She answered, "As the Lord your God lives, I have no bread, only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. Look, I am gathering two sticks so I can go home and prepare it for myself and my son, so we can eat it and then die."
1 Kings 17:13 Elijah said to her, "Do not be afraid. Go and do as you have said, but first make a small flat cake for me from your flour and bring it to me. Afterwards, you can prepare some for yourself and your son."
1 Kings 17:14 "For this is what the Lord God of Israel declares: 'The jar of flour will not be emptied, and the jug of oil will not run dry, until the day the Lord sends rain upon the face of the earth.'"
1 Kings 17:15 So she went and did as Elijah told her. And she, and her household, and Elijah, had enough to eat for many days.
1 Kings 17:16 And the jar of flour did not run out, nor did the jug of oil diminish, just as the Lord had promised through Elijah.
1 Kings 17:17 Now it happened after these events that the son of the woman, who owned the house, became ill. His sickness was so severe that he stopped breathing and no life remained in him.
1 Kings 17:18 So she said to Elijah, "What have you done to me, O man of God? Have you come to remind me of my sins and to cause the death of my son?"
1 Kings 17:19 And Elijah said to her, "Give me your son." He took the boy from her arms, carried him up to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.
1 Kings 17:20 Then he cried out to the Lord, "O Lord my God, have You brought this tragedy upon the widow with whom I am staying, by causing her son to die?"
1 Kings 17:21 Then Elijah stretched himself out on the boy three times. And he cried out to the Lord, "O Lord my God, please let the life breath of this boy return to his body!"
1 Kings 17:22 And the Lord listened to Elijah's prayer. The life breath of the boy returned to him, and he revived.
1 Kings 17:23 Then Elijah took the boy and brought him down from the upper room into the house below. He gave him to his mother and said, "See, your son is alive!"
1 Kings 17:24 And the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know by this that you truly are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord spoken through you is true."
1 Kings 18:1 After many days—specifically, in the third year of the drought—a message from the Lord came to Elijah, saying: "Go and present yourself to King Ahab, so that I may send rain upon the earth."
1 Kings 18:2 So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. There was a severe famine throughout Samaria, the capital city of Israel and its surrounding region.
1 Kings 18:3 King Ahab had called Obadiah, who was the chief steward of his royal household. Obadiah, for his part, greatly feared and reverenced the Lord.
1 Kings 18:4 For when Jezebel, the queen, was slaughtering the prophets of the Lord—who spoke truly for God—Obadiah had taken one hundred of these prophets and hidden them, fifty in one cave and fifty in another, and he had secretly provided them with food and water.
1 Kings 18:5 So King Ahab said to Obadiah: "Go throughout the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we will find enough grass to save the horses and mules, so that all the animals do not perish entirely."
1 Kings 18:6 Then they divided the land between themselves to search for water: Ahab went one way alone, and Obadiah went another way alone.
1 Kings 18:7 While Obadiah was on his way, Elijah suddenly met him. When Obadiah recognized Elijah, he fell on his face and said, "Is it really you, my master Elijah?"
1 Kings 18:8 And Elijah responded: "It is I. Go and tell your master, 'Behold, Elijah is here!'
1 Kings 18:9 Obadiah then said: "What sin have I committed, that you would hand over your servant into the hand of Ahab, so that he may kill me?"
1 Kings 18:10 "As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master, King Ahab, has not sent messengers to search for you. And when they replied, 'He is not here,' he made those kingdoms and nations swear an oath that you could not be found, so determined was he to find you or confirmation of your absence."
1 Kings 18:11 "And now you tell me: 'Go and tell your master: Behold, Elijah is here!'"
1 Kings 18:12 "For as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of the Lord will carry you away to a place I do not know. Then, when I go and report to Ahab that you are here, and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. And I, your servant, have feared the Lord since my youth!"
1 Kings 18:13 "Has it not been reported to you, my master, what I did when Jezebel was slaughtering the prophets of the Lord? How I hid a hundred men of the Lord's prophets, fifty by fifty in caves, and fed them with bread and water?"
1 Kings 18:14 "And now you tell me: 'Go and tell your master: Behold, Elijah is here!' This will surely result in him killing me."
1 Kings 18:15 Then Elijah said: "As the Lord of hosts lives, in whose presence I stand—meaning I am His servant ready to do His will—I tell you for certain that today I will appear before King Ahab."
1 Kings 18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and informed him. And Ahab then went to meet Elijah.
1 Kings 18:17 When Ahab saw Elijah, he said: "Is it really you, the one who troubles Israel by causing this famine and distress?"
1 Kings 18:18 And Elijah replied: "I have not troubled Israel, but you and the house of your father have troubled it, because you have forsaken the Lord, the true God, and have followed the false gods known as the Baalim."
1 Kings 18:19 "Nevertheless, now send word and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel. Also gather the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of the Asherah poles—idols of a false goddess—who are supported and eat at Jezebel's table."
1 Kings 18:20 Ahab sent out word to all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets to Mount Carmel.
1 Kings 18:21 Then Elijah approached all the people and said: "How long will you waver and limp between two opinions, unable to make a choice? If the Lord is truly God, then follow Him! But if Baal is god, then follow him!" And the people did not answer him a single word.
1 Kings 18:22 Elijah then said to the people: "I alone remain as a prophet of the Lord, whereas the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men."
1 Kings 18:23 "Let two oxen be given to us. Let them choose one ox for themselves, cut it into pieces, and place it on the wood, but let them not put fire underneath it. Then I will prepare the other ox, and I will place it on the wood, and I will not put fire underneath it."
1 Kings 18:24 "You are to call upon the names of your gods, and I will call upon the name of my Lord. And the God who answers by sending fire—He is truly God." And all the people answered and said, "This is an excellent proposal!"
1 Kings 18:25 So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal: "Choose one ox for yourselves and prepare it first, since there are many of you. And call upon the names of your gods, but do not put fire underneath."
1 Kings 18:26 When they had taken the ox that had been given to them, they prepared it. And they called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying: "Baal, hear us!" But there was no voice, nor anyone who answered. And they kept leaping around the altar that they had made in a frenzied dance.
1 Kings 18:27 And when it was already noon, Elijah mocked them, saying: "Cry out with a louder voice! For he is a god, surely, and perhaps he is speaking to someone, or he is in a private place, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and needs to be awakened."
1 Kings 18:28 So they cried out with a loud voice, and, according to their custom, they cut themselves with knives and lances until they were drenched with their own blood.
1 Kings 18:29 After noon, and when the regular hours for their prophecy had passed, they continued their prophetic frenzy according to their custom until the time of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice, no one who answered, and no one who paid any attention.
1 Kings 18:30 Then Elijah said to all the people: "Come closer to me." And all the people came closer to him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been torn down.
1 Kings 18:31 Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob—to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, "Israel shall be your name."
1 Kings 18:32 And with these stones, he built an altar in the name of the Lord. He then made a trench around the altar, large enough to contain two measures of grain.
1 Kings 18:33 He arranged the wood, and cutting the ox into pieces, he placed it on the wood.
1 Kings 18:34 And he said: "Fill four jars with water and pour it over the burnt offering and over the wood." Again he said: "Do it a second time." And when they had done it a second time, he said: "Do it a third time also." And they did it a third time.
1 Kings 18:35 The water flowed all around the altar and even filled the trench completely.
1 Kings 18:36 And when it was time to offer the evening burnt offering, Elijah the prophet approached and said: "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known that You are God in Israel, and that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your command."
1 Kings 18:37 "Hear me, O Lord, hear me! Let this people know today that You, O Lord, are the true God, and that You have turned their hearts back to You once more."
1 Kings 18:38 Then the fire of the Lord fell from heaven and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and even the dust, and licked up all the water that was in the trench.
1 Kings 18:39 And when all the people saw this, they fell on their faces and exclaimed: "The Lord—He alone is God! The Lord—He alone is God!"
1 Kings 18:40 Elijah then said to them: "Seize the prophets of Baal! Let not one of them escape!" And when they had seized them, Elijah led them down to the Brook Kishon and killed them there, executing judgment on false prophets according to the Law of Moses.
1 Kings 19:1 Achab then told Jezabel everything that Elias had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with a sword.
1 Kings 19:2 So Jezabel sent a messenger to Elias, saying: "May the gods strike me down and do more if, by this time tomorrow, I do not make your life like the life of one of those prophets you killed."
1 Kings 19:3 Therefore Elias was afraid, and he arose and went wherever his will led him. He came to Bersabee, which belongs to Juda, and left his servant there.
1 Kings 19:4 But Elias himself went a day's journey into the wilderness. When he arrived, he sat down under a juniper tree and prayed that he might die, saying: "It is enough, O Lord. Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors."
1 Kings 19:5 He then laid down and fell asleep in the shade of the juniper tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said: "Arise, and eat."
1 Kings 19:6 He looked up and saw, right by his head, a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. He ate, drank, and then lay down to sleep again.
1 Kings 19:7 Then the angel of the Lord returned a second time and touched him, saying: "Arise and eat, for you have a long journey ahead of you."
1 Kings 19:8 So Elias arose, ate, and drank. And strengthened by that food, he walked for forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mount of God.
1 Kings 19:9 When he arrived there, he stayed in a cave. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying: "What are you doing here, Elias?"
1 Kings 19:10 Elias responded: "I am consumed with zeal for the Lord, God of all creation's armies, because the children of Israel have abandoned your covenant. They have torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking to take my life."
1 Kings 19:11 Then the Lord said to him: "Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord." And behold, the Lord was passing by. A great and strong wind tore the mountains apart and broke rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind.
1 Kings 19:12 After the wind came an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake came fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, there was the whisper of a gentle breeze.
1 Kings 19:13 And when Elias heard it, he covered his face with his cloak and went out, standing at the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him, saying: "What are you doing here, Elias?"
1 Kings 19:14 Elias responded: "I am consumed with zeal for the Lord, God of all creation's armies, because the children of Israel have abandoned your covenant. They have torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they are seeking to take my life."
1 Kings 19:15 Then the Lord said to him: "Go, return on your way through the wilderness to Damascus. When you arrive there, you are to anoint Hazaël as king over Syria."
1 Kings 19:16 You shall also anoint Jehu, the son of Namsi, as king over Israel. And Eliseus, the son of Saphat, from Abelmeula, you shall anoint as prophet in your place.
1 Kings 19:17 And it shall be that whoever escapes the sword of Hazaël, Jehu will put him to death. And whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Eliseus will put him to death.
1 Kings 19:18 Yet I will preserve for myself seven thousand in Israel: all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not worshipped him.
1 Kings 19:19 So Elias departed from that place and found Eliseus, the son of Saphat, plowing with twelve pairs of oxen. He himself was with the twelfth pair. And when Elias came to him, he threw his cloak over him — a symbolic gesture of calling and succession.
1 Kings 19:20 Immediately, Eliseus left the oxen and ran after Elias. He said: "Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you." Elias replied: "Go, and return. For what was my part, I have done to you."
1 Kings 19:21 So Eliseus returned from Elias, took a pair of oxen, and sacrificed them. He cooked their meat using the wooden parts of the plows as fuel, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, went after Elias, and served him.
1 Kings 19:1 And Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done, and how Elijah had executed all the false prophets with a sword.
1 Kings 19:2 So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah with a message: 'May my gods do to me and more also if, by this time tomorrow, I do not make your life like the life of one of those prophets he killed.'
1 Kings 19:3 Elijah was afraid, so he got up and went wherever he felt led to flee. He came to Beersheba in Judah and left his servant there.
1 Kings 19:4 Then he himself traveled into the desert, a day's journey. When he arrived, he sat down under a single juniper tree. He prayed for himself to die and said, 'I have had enough, Lord. Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors.'
1 Kings 19:5 He lay down and fell asleep in the shade of the juniper tree. Suddenly, an angel touched him and said to him, 'Get up and eat!'
1 Kings 19:6 He looked, and there by his head was a freshly baked loaf of bread and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and then lay down and fell asleep again.
1 Kings 19:7 And the angel of the Lord returned a second time and touched him and said to him, 'Get up and eat, for you have a long journey ahead of you.'
1 Kings 19:8 So he got up, ate, and drank. And he walked for forty days and forty nights, sustained by the strength of that food, until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
1 Kings 19:9 When he arrived there, he stayed in a cave. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him and said to him, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'
1 Kings 19:10 He answered, 'I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of Hosts, because the children of Israel have abandoned Your covenant. They have torn down Your altars, and they have executed Your prophets with a sword. And I am left all alone, and they are seeking to take my life away.'
1 Kings 19:11 And He said to him, 'Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord.' And behold, the Lord is about to pass by. And a great and powerful wind began to tear apart the mountains and shatter rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind.
1 Kings 19:12 After the wind, there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, there was the soft sound of a gentle breeze.
1 Kings 19:13 And when Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his cloak, and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him saying, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'
1 Kings 19:14 He answered, 'I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of Hosts, because the children of Israel have abandoned Your covenant. They have torn down Your altars, and they have executed Your prophets with a sword. And I am left all alone, and they are seeking to take my life away.'
1 Kings 19:15 And the Lord said to him, 'Go, and return by your path through the desert toward Damascus. And when you arrive there, you are to anoint Hazael as king over Syria.'
1 Kings 19:16 You are also to anoint Jehu, the son of Nimshi, as king over Israel. And Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who is from Abel-meholah, you are to anoint as prophet in your place.
1 Kings 19:17 And it shall come to pass that whoever escapes Hazael's sword, Jehu will kill them. And whoever escapes Jehu's sword, Elisha will kill them.
1 Kings 19:18 And I will preserve for Myself in Israel seven thousand people, all whose knees have not bowed down before Baal, and every mouth that has not worshiped him.
1 Kings 19:19 So Elijah departed from there and found Elisha, the son of Shaphat, plowing with twelve teams of oxen; he himself was guiding the twelfth team. When Elijah came to him, he threw his cloak over him.
1 Kings 19:20 Immediately, he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, 'Please allow me to go kiss my father and mother goodbye, and then I will follow you.' And Elijah said to him, 'Go and return! For what have I done to hinder you?'
1 Kings 19:21 So Elisha returned from him. He took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them as a sacrifice, and with the plowing equipment, he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he got up, went, followed Elijah, and served him.
1 Kings 19:1 And Ahab informed Jezebel about everything Elijah had done, including how he had killed all the false prophets of Baal with a sword.
1 Kings 19:2 So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying: 'May *my* pagan gods do this to me, and even more severe punishment add to it, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the life of one of those false prophets Elijah killed!'
1 Kings 19:3 So Elijah was afraid, and rising, he left and went wherever his spirit carried him. He came to Beer-sheba in Judah, and he left his servant boy there.
1 Kings 19:4 And he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness. When he arrived, and sat under a broom tree, he asked for his life to end, and he said: 'It is enough for me now, O Lord; take away my life, for I am no better than my ancestors!'
1 Kings 19:5 And he lay down and fell asleep in the shade of the broom tree. And behold, an angel of the Lord touched him and said to him: 'Rise and eat.'
1 Kings 19:6 He looked, and behold, at his head was a hearth-cake—bread baked on hot stones—and a jar of water. And he ate and drank, and lay down to sleep again.
1 Kings 19:7 And the angel of the Lord returned a second time and touched him, and said to him: 'Rise and eat, for a long journey still awaits you.'
1 Kings 19:8 So he rose, and ate and drank, and he walked in the strength of that food for forty days and forty nights, all the way to Horeb, the mountain of God.
1 Kings 19:9 When he arrived there, he stayed in a cave. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and said to him: 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'
1 Kings 19:10 He responded: 'I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of armies and heavenly hosts, because the children of Israel have abandoned your covenant. They have destroyed your altars, and they have killed your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left, and they seek to take my life away.'
1 Kings 19:11 And He said to him: 'Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord.' And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore down the mountains and shattered rocks before the Lord. But the Lord was not in that violent wind.
1 Kings 19:12 And after the wind, there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, there was a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, there was the sound of a gentle, soft whisper.
1 Kings 19:13 When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his mantle, and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him, saying: 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'
1 Kings 19:14 He responded: 'I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of armies and heavenly hosts, because the children of Israel have abandoned your covenant. They have destroyed your altars, and they have killed your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left, and they seek to take my life away.'
1 Kings 19:15 And the Lord said to him: 'Go, and return on your way through the wilderness to Damascus. And when you arrive there, you shall anoint Hazael as king over Aram (Syria).'
1 Kings 19:16 And you shall anoint Jehu, the son of Nimshi, as king over Israel. And Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who is from Abel-meholah, you shall anoint as a prophet in your place.
1 Kings 19:17 And it shall come to pass: whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill him. And whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall effectively cause his death through divine judgment.
1 Kings 19:18 Yet I will leave for myself in Israel seven thousand people, all whose knees have not bowed before Baal, and every mouth that has not worshipped him.
1 Kings 19:19 So Elijah departed from there and found Elisha, the son of Shaphat, plowing with twelve yokes of oxen, and Elisha himself was with the twelfth yoke. And when Elijah came to him, he threw his mantle over him, signifying the passing of prophetic authority.
1 Kings 19:20 Elisha immediately left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said: 'Please let me kiss my father and my mother goodbye, and then I will follow you.' And Elijah said to him: 'Go back to your family, and then return; for what have I done to you? (My action was a clear call to prophetic duty, not something to be lightly taken).'
1 Kings 19:21 So he returned from Elijah, took a yoke of oxen, and sacrificed them. And he cooked their meat using the plowing equipment as fuel, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, went, and followed Elijah, and served him as his attendant.

1 Kings 20:1 Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, gathered his entire army, and thirty-two other kings were with him. He had many horses and chariots. He marched and fought against the city-state of Samaria and began to besiege it.
1 Kings 20:2 Then he sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel, into the city of Samaria.
1 Kings 20:3 Ben-hadad's message said: 'This is what Ben-hadad says: Your silver and your gold are mine. And your finest wives and your children are mine as well.'
1 Kings 20:4 The king of Israel responded, 'As you have said, my lord king, I am yours, and everything I possess belongs to you.'
1 Kings 20:5 The messengers returned and said, 'This is what Ben-hadad says: I sent word to you, saying, "You shall hand over your silver and your gold, your wives and your children to me."
1 Kings 20:6 Therefore, tomorrow at this time, I will send my servants to you. They will search your house and the houses of your servants, and they will seize and take away with their own hands whatever pleases them.'
1 Kings 20:7 So Ahab called together all the elders of the land and said, 'Notice this, and see that he is seeking trouble with us. He sent to me for my wives and my children, and for my silver and gold, and I did not refuse him.'
1 Kings 20:8 Then all the elders and all the people said to him, 'Do not consent, and do not listen to his demands.'
1 Kings 20:9 So Ahab responded to Ben-hadad's messengers, saying, 'Tell my lord the king: All that you first sent to me, your servant will do. But this second demand, I cannot do.' The messengers returned and reported this to Ben-hadad.
1 Kings 20:10 Then Ben-hadad sent a message to Ahab, saying, 'May the pagan gods do this to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria is enough to fill the hands of all the people who are following me to battle!'
1 Kings 20:11 The king of Israel responded, saying, 'Tell him: Let not him who puts on his armor boast as much as he who takes it off after victory.'
1 Kings 20:12 Now it happened that when Ben-hadad heard this word, he was drinking with the other kings in their tents. He said to his servants, 'Prepare for attack!' And they positioned the army against the city.
1 Kings 20:13 Then, behold, a prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and said, 'This is what the Lord says: Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver them into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the Lord, the one true God.'
1 Kings 20:14 Ahab asked, 'By whom will you do this?' The Lord replied to him, 'By the young men who are the servants of the provincial governors.' And Ahab asked, 'Who will begin the battle?' The prophet answered him, 'You will.'
1 Kings 20:15 So Ahab mustered the young men of the provincial governors and found their number to be two hundred and thirty-two. After them, he mustered all the common people of the sons of Israel, seven thousand in total.
1 Kings 20:16 They marched out at noon. Ben-hadad, meanwhile, was drunk in his tents, along with the thirty-two kings who had been summoned to him.
1 Kings 20:17 The young men of the provincial governors went out first. Ben-hadad sent out scouts who reported to him, 'Men have come out from Samaria!'
1 Kings 20:18 Ben-hadad then said, 'Whether they have come out for peace, seize them alive; or if they have come out to fight, seize them alive.'
1 Kings 20:19 So the young men of the provincial governors went out, and the rest of the army followed behind them.
1 Kings 20:20 Each man struck down the opponent who came against him. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, also fled on his horse with his horsemen.
1 Kings 20:21 So the king of Israel went out and struck down the horses and chariots, and he inflicted a great defeat on Syria.
1 Kings 20:22 Then the prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, 'Go, strengthen yourself, and take note and see what you must do. For when the year comes around again, the king of Syria will march up against you.'
1 Kings 20:23 Now the servants of the king of Syria said to him, 'Their gods are gods of the mountains; that is why they overpowered us. But if we fight against them on the plains, we will surely overpower them.'
1 Kings 20:24 Therefore, do this: remove all the other kings from your army, and put military commanders in their places.
1 Kings 20:25 Then rebuild the number of soldiers, according to the previous army, and the horses as before, and the chariots as before. Then we will fight them on the plains, and we will see if we do not overpower them.' Ben-hadad believed their counsel and acted accordingly.
1 Kings 20:26 And so, after seven years, Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and marched to Aphek to fight against Israel.
1 Kings 20:27 But the sons of Israel were also mustered and, having taken provisions, went out to confront them. They appeared like two small flocks of goats, while the Syrians, in contrast, filled the entire land.
1 Kings 20:28 Then a man of God approached the king of Israel and said, 'This is what the Lord says: Because the Syrians declared, 'The Lord is a god of the mountains, and not a god of the valleys,' I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord, the one true God.'
1 Kings 20:29 They camped opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day, the battle began. The sons of Israel struck down one hundred thousand Syrian foot soldiers in a single day.
1 Kings 20:30 The remaining soldiers fled into the city of Aphek, and the city wall collapsed upon twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left. Ben-hadad himself fled and entered the city, hiding in an inner chamber.
1 Kings 20:31 His servants said to him, 'Behold, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us therefore put sackcloth on our bodies and ropes around our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will save our lives.'
1 Kings 20:32 So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes around their heads. They came to the king of Israel and said, 'Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please let my life be spared!'' Ahab replied, 'If he is still alive, he is my brother.'
1 Kings 20:33 The men took this as a good omen, quickly seizing upon his words, and said, 'Your brother Ben-hadad!' Ahab then said, 'Go and bring him here.' So Ben-hadad came out to him, and Ahab had him come up into his chariot.
1 Kings 20:34 Ben-hadad said to him, 'The cities that my father took from your father, I will restore. And you may establish trading quarters for yourself in Damascus, just as my father established them in Samaria.' Ahab said, 'I will make a covenant with you and then release you.' So Ahab made a covenant with him and released him.
1 Kings 20:35 Then one of the sons of the prophets, according to a command from the Lord, said to his companion, 'Strike me!' But his companion refused to strike him.
1 Kings 20:36 The prophet then said, 'Because you refused to obey the voice of the Lord, behold, a lion will kill you!' And indeed, a lion found him and killed him.
1 Kings 20:37 Then he went to another man and said, 'Strike me!' And the man struck him and wounded him.
1 Kings 20:38 So the prophet went and waited for the king by the road, disguising himself as if wounded, with his eyes covered by dust.
1 Kings 20:39 As the king passed by, the prophet cried out to him and said, 'Your servant went out into the midst of the battle. And behold, when a man had turned aside, he brought a man to me and said, 'Guard this man. If he escapes in any way, your life will be taken for his life, or you will pay a talent of silver.''
1 Kings 20:40 'While your servant was distracted and busy here and there, the man suddenly disappeared.' The king of Israel said to him, 'That is your judgment, for you have decreed it yourself.'
1 Kings 20:1 Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, gathered his entire army, which included thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots. He then marched up to Samaria and besieged it, preparing to fight against the city.
1 Kings 20:2 He sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel, who was inside the city.
1 Kings 20:3 The message from Ben-Hadad said: 'Your silver and gold, your wives, and the best of your children are all mine.'
1 Kings 20:4 The king of Israel replied: 'As you say, my lord king, I am yours, and all that I possess is yours.'
1 Kings 20:5 The messengers returned to Ben-Hadad and delivered his response. But Ben-Hadad sent them back with a new message: 'I sent to you earlier, stating that you must give me your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children.'
1 Kings 20:6 'Therefore, by this time tomorrow, I will send my servants to you. They will search through your house and the houses of your officials, and they will take away whatever they desire.'
1 Kings 20:7 King Ahab called together all the elders of the land and said: 'Notice how this man is seeking to destroy us. He first sent for my wives and children, and my silver and gold, and I did not refuse him.'
1 Kings 20:8 All the elders and all the people told him: 'Do not agree to this, nor listen to his demands.'
1 Kings 20:9 So Ahab responded to Ben-Hadad’s messengers: 'Tell my lord the king: Everything you first demanded, I will do. But this latest demand I cannot fulfill.'
1 Kings 20:10 The messengers returned and reported this to Ben-Hadad. Ben-Hadad then sent a message to Ahab, saying: 'May the gods punish me severely and even more if the dust of Samaria is enough to fill the handfuls of all the people who follow me!' —meaning, 'My army is so vast, Samaria will be utterly destroyed and turn to dust, and there won't even be enough dust to fill their hands.'
1 Kings 20:11 The king of Israel responded to Ben-Hadad: 'Tell him this: One who is putting on his armor for battle should not boast as if he were taking it off after victory.'
1 Kings 20:12 Meanwhile, Ben-Hadad and the other kings were drinking in their temporary shelters when this message was delivered. Ben-Hadad then said to his servants: 'Surround the city for attack!' So they surrounded Samaria.
1 Kings 20:13 Then a prophet approached King Ahab of Israel, saying: 'The Lord says this: 'See this immense multitude? Indeed, I will deliver them into your hand today, so you will know that I am the Lord.''
1 Kings 20:14 Ahab asked: 'By whose hand will this be done?' The prophet replied: 'The Lord says this: 'Through the young men who serve the provincial governors.'' Ahab then asked: 'Who will begin the battle?' And the prophet said: 'You will.'
1 Kings 20:15 So Ahab counted the young men who served the provincial governors, and found two hundred and thirty-two of them. After them, he counted all the people, all the sons of Israel, totaling seven thousand.
1 Kings 20:16 They marched out at noon. Ben-Hadad, however, was in his temporary shelter, drinking heavily with the thirty-two kings who had come to aid him.
1 Kings 20:17 The young men serving the provincial governors were the first to march out. Ben-Hadad had sent scouts, who reported to him: 'Men are coming out from Samaria.'
1 Kings 20:18 Ben-Hadad said: 'If they come out for peace, take them alive. If they come out to fight, capture them alive.'
1 Kings 20:19 So the young men from the provincial governors' retinues marched out of the city, with the main Israelite army following behind them.
1 Kings 20:20 Each Israelite soldier struck down his opponent. The Syrians fled in disarray, and Israel pursued them. Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, also fled on horseback with his cavalry.
1 Kings 20:21 The king of Israel then rode out and struck down the Syrian horses and chariots, inflicting a great slaughter upon Syria.
1 Kings 20:22 The prophet again approached the king of Israel and said to him: 'Go and strengthen yourself. Take note and consider carefully what you must do, because at the turn of the year, the king of Syria will return to fight against you.'
1 Kings 20:23 The servants of the king of Syria said to him: 'Their gods are gods of the mountains; that is why they overpowered us. But it is better that we fight against them on the plains, and then we will surely defeat them.'
1 Kings 20:24 'Therefore, do this: Remove the kings from their positions, each from his own post, and appoint governors in their place.'
1 Kings 20:25 'Also, restore the number of soldiers who fell from your ranks, and replace the horses with their former number, and the chariots as they were before. Then we will fight against them on the plains, and you will see that we will surely defeat them.' Ben-Hadad believed their words and acted accordingly.
1 Kings 20:26 So, at the turn of the year, Ben-Hadad assembled the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
1 Kings 20:27 Meanwhile, the sons of Israel were also assembled, and after taking provisions, they marched out to meet them. The sons of Israel encamped opposite them, appearing like two small flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the entire land.
1 Kings 20:28 Then a man of God approached the king of Israel and said: 'The Lord says this: 'Because the Syrians said, 'The Lord is a God of the mountains, and not a God of the valleys,' I will give this entire great multitude into your hand, and you will know that I am the Lord.''
1 Kings 20:29 For seven days, they encamped opposite one another. On the seventh day, the battle began, and the sons of Israel struck down one hundred thousand Syrian foot soldiers in a single day.
1 Kings 20:30 The remaining Syrian soldiers fled into the city of Aphek. And the city wall collapsed upon the twenty-seven thousand men who had survived. Ben-Hadad, however, fled and entered the city, hiding in an inner chamber within a room.
1 Kings 20:31 His servants said to him: 'Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Therefore, let us put on sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare our lives.'
1 Kings 20:32 So they girded sackcloth around their waists and placed ropes around their heads. They came to the king of Israel and said to him: 'Your servant Ben-Hadad says: 'Please let me live!'' And Ahab replied: 'If he is still alive, he is my brother.'
1 Kings 20:33 The men took this as a good omen, and seized upon his words, saying: 'Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad is alive!' Ahab then told them: 'Go and bring him here.' So Ben-Hadad came out to him, and Ahab had him get into his own chariot.
1 Kings 20:34 Ben-Hadad said to him: 'The cities that my father took from your father, I will restore to you. And you may establish marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, just as my father established them in Samaria. I will make a treaty with you, and then I will release you.' So Ahab made a treaty with him and set him free.
1 Kings 20:35 Then one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion, by the word of the Lord: 'Strike me!' But his companion refused to strike him.
1 Kings 20:36 So the prophet said to him: 'Because you refused to obey the voice of the Lord, behold, as soon as you leave me, a lion will strike you down.' And when he had left the prophet, a lion found him and struck him dead.
1 Kings 20:37 The prophet then found another man from the sons of the prophets and said: 'Strike me!' And that man struck him, wounding him.
1 Kings 20:38 So the prophet went and waited for the king by the roadside. He disguised himself by putting dust on his face and covering his eyes and forehead, hiding his identity.
1 Kings 20:39 As the king passed by, the prophet cried out to him, saying: 'Your servant went out into the midst of the battle. And when a man turned aside and brought another man to me, he said to me: 'Guard this man. If he escapes in any way, you will forfeit your own life for his life, or you will weigh out a talent of silver.''
1 Kings 20:40 'While your servant was busy here and there, the man suddenly disappeared.' The king of Israel said to him: 'This is your judgment, which you yourself have decided.'
1 Kings 20:1 So Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, gathered his entire army. He had thirty-two other kings with him, along with their cavalry forces and chariots. They advanced, besieged Samaria, and began to wage war against it.
1 Kings 20:2 He sent messengers into the city to Ahab, the king of Israel,
1 Kings 20:3 saying: "Ben-Hadad declares this: All your silver and all your gold are mine. Your finest wives and your children are also mine."
1 Kings 20:4 The king of Israel responded: "As you have said, my lord king, I am your servant, and all that I have is yours."
1 Kings 20:5 But the messenger returned again and said to Ahab: "Ben-Hadad declares this: I sent word to you saying, 'You must give me your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children.'
1 Kings 20:6 Therefore, tomorrow at this time, I will send my servants to you. They will search through your palace and the treasuries of your officials. Everything that seems desirable to them, they will take and carry away."
1 Kings 20:7 Then Ahab summoned all the elders of the land and said: "Notice and consider how this man is plotting against us. For when he sent for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, I did not refuse him."
1 Kings 20:8 All the elders and all the people told him: "Do not consent, nor listen to his demand."
1 Kings 20:9 So Ahab replied to Ben-Hadad’s messengers: "Tell my lord the king: Everything that you first demanded from your servant, I will do. But this latest demand, I cannot fulfill." The messengers returned and reported this to Ben-Hadad.
1 Kings 20:10 Then Ben-Hadad sent word to Ahab, saying: "May the gods deal with me, and add even more punishments, if there is enough dust in Samaria for each of my followers to fill their hands! This means Samaria will be utterly destroyed by my vast army."
1 Kings 20:11 The king of Israel replied: "Tell him this proverb: 'Let not the one who puts on his armor boast as much as the one who takes it off.' In other words, don't boast before the battle is won."
1 Kings 20:12 When Ben-Hadad heard this message, he was drinking with the other kings in their tents. He then ordered his servants: "Surround the city!" So they began to besiege the city.
1 Kings 20:13 Then, a prophet approached Ahab, the king of Israel, and declared: "Thus says the Lord God: 'Have you seen this vast multitude? Behold, I will deliver them into your hand today, so that you may know that I am the Lord God.'"
1 Kings 20:14 Ahab asked: "By whom will you do this?" The prophet replied: "Thus says the Lord God: 'By the young men who serve the provincial governors.'" Ahab then asked: "Who will begin the attack?" The prophet answered: "You, yourself."
1 Kings 20:15 So Ahab counted the young men who served the provincial governors, and there were two hundred and thirty-two of them. After them, he numbered all the people, the sons of Israel, who were seven thousand strong.
1 Kings 20:16 They marched out at noon. Meanwhile, Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two kings who had come to assist him were drinking themselves drunk in their tents.
1 Kings 20:17 The young men of the provincial governors went out first. Ben-Hadad sent out scouts, who reported back to him, saying: "Some men have come out of Samaria!"
1 Kings 20:18 He commanded: "Whether they have come out to seek peace, capture them alive. Or if they have come out to fight, capture them alive as well!"
1 Kings 20:19 So the young men of the provincial governors went out, and the rest of the Israelite army followed behind them.
1 Kings 20:20 Each one struck down the man who confronted him. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, also fled on horseback with his cavalry.
1 Kings 20:21 The king of Israel went out and struck down the Syrian horses and chariots, inflicting a great defeat upon Syria.
1 Kings 20:22 Then the prophet came to the king of Israel and told him: "Go now, strengthen your forces, take note, and consider what you must do, because at the turn of the year, the king of Syria will come up against you again."
1 Kings 20:23 But the servants of the king of Syria said to him: "Their gods are gods of the mountains; that is why they have overpowered us. But it is better that we fight against them on the plains, and then we will surely defeat them."
1 Kings 20:24 Take this counsel: Remove all the kings from their positions in your army, and appoint commanders in their place.
1 Kings 20:25 Then, restore the number of soldiers that you lost, and replace the horses with new horses, and the chariots with new chariots, just as you had before. We will fight against them on the plains, and you will see that we will surely prevail." Ben-Hadad trusted their advice and acted accordingly.
1 Kings 20:26 So, after a year had passed, Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
1 Kings 20:27 Meanwhile, the sons of Israel were also mustered. They took provisions and marched out to confront the Syrians. The sons of Israel encamped opposite them, looking like two small flocks of goats, while the Syrians completely covered the surface of the land.
1 Kings 20:28 Then a man of God approached the king of Israel and declared: "Thus says the Lord God: 'Because the Syrians have said, 'The Lord is a god of the mountains, but not a god of the valleys,' I will deliver this entire vast multitude into your hand. Then you will know that I am the Lord God.'"
1 Kings 20:29 They encamped opposite one another for seven days. On the seventh day, the battle began. And the sons of Israel struck down one hundred thousand Syrian foot soldiers in a single day.
1 Kings 20:30 Those who remained alive fled into the city of Aphek, but the wall collapsed upon twenty-seven thousand of the remaining men. Ben-Hadad, however, fled and entered the city, hiding in an inner chamber within a room.
1 Kings 20:31 His servants said to him: "Behold, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us, therefore, put sackcloth around our waists and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare our lives."
1 Kings 20:32 So they girded themselves with sackcloth around their waists and ropes upon their heads. They came to the king of Israel and said to him: "Your servant Ben-Hadad says: 'Please, let my life be spared.'"
1 Kings 20:33 Ahab replied: "If he is still alive, he is my brother." The men took this as a favorable sign and quickly seized upon his word, confirming: "Indeed! Your brother Ben-Hadad!"
1 Kings 20:34 Ahab then commanded: "Go and bring him here." So Ben-Hadad came out to him, and Ahab invited him to step into his own chariot.
1 Kings 20:35 Ben-Hadad then said to him: "The cities that my father took from your father, I will restore. You may also establish marketplaces for yourself in Damascus, just as my father established them in Samaria. I will make a treaty with you." Ahab replied: "Therefore, I will make a treaty with you and then release you." So Ahab made a treaty with Ben-Hadad and set him free.
1 Kings 20:36 At that time, a certain man from among the sons of the prophets said to his companion, by the word of the Lord: "Strike me!" But his companion refused to strike him.
1 Kings 20:37 So the prophet said to him: "Because you refused to obey the voice of the Lord, behold, as soon as you leave me, a lion will strike you down." And when he departed from him, a lion found him and struck him down.
1 Kings 20:38 He then found another man and said: "Strike me!" And this man struck him and wounded him severely.
1 Kings 20:39 So the prophet went and waited for the king by the road, disguising himself with ashes on his face and over his eyes to appear wounded.
1 Kings 20:40 As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him and said: "Your servant went out to the front lines of the battle, and behold, a man turned aside and brought a prisoner to me, saying: 'Guard this man. If he escapes, you shall pay with your own life for his life, or else you must pay a talent of silver.'"
1 Kings 21:1 After these events, a certain time came to pass: Naboth, from Jezreel, owned a vineyard which was next to the royal palace of King Ahab, who reigned in Samaria.
1 Kings 21:2 So King Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying to him: 'Give me your vineyard, so I can make it into a vegetable garden for myself, because it's so close to my royal house. I will give you a better vineyard for it, or, if you prefer, I will pay you its worth in silver.'
1 Kings 21:3 But Naboth answered him: 'May the Lord be merciful to me! I will not give you the inheritance I received from my ancestors.'
1 Kings 21:4 So Ahab returned to his house, gloomy and indignant because of the words Naboth the Jezreelite had said: 'I will not give you the inheritance from my fathers.' He threw himself onto his bed, turned his face toward the wall, and refused to eat any food.
1 Kings 21:5 Then Jezebel, his wife, came in to him and said to him: 'What is this, that your spirit is so sad, and you are not eating any food?'
1 Kings 21:6 He answered her: 'I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him: 'Give me your vineyard for money, or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'
1 Kings 21:7 Then Jezebel said to him: 'Are you truly reigning as king over Israel with confidence right now? Get up, eat your food, and cheer up! For I will certainly give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite!'
1 Kings 21:8 So Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his royal signet ring. She then sent these letters to the elders and nobles, who lived in Naboth's city and with him.
1 Kings 21:9 And this is what she wrote in the letters: 'Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people.'
1 Kings 21:10 'Then bring two worthless men, 'sons of Belial,' to accuse him, who will testify against him, saying: 'He cursed God and the king!' Then take him outside the city, stone him to death, and let him die.'
1 Kings 21:11 So the men of Naboth's city—the elders and nobles who lived there with him—did as Jezebel had commanded them, just as it was written in the letters she had sent to them.
1 Kings 21:12 They proclaimed a fast, and they seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people.
1 Kings 21:13 Then two worthless men, 'sons of Belial,' were brought in and seated opposite him. They testified against him before the assembled crowd, saying: 'Naboth cursed God and the king!' So they dragged him outside the city and killed him with stones.
1 Kings 21:14 Then they sent a message to Jezebel, saying: 'Naboth has been stoned, and he is dead.'
1 Kings 21:15 When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she spoke to Ahab, saying: 'Get up, and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, who refused to agree with you and give it to you for money. For Naboth is no longer alive; he is dead.'
1 Kings 21:16 When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, so that he could take possession of it.
1 Kings 21:17 Now the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:
1 Kings 21:18 'Get up and go down to meet Ahab, the king of Israel, who is in Samaria. Look, he is in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone down to take possession of it.'
1 Kings 21:19 'And you shall speak to him, saying: 'Thus says the Lord: 'Have you murdered, and then also taken possession?' And then you shall add: 'Thus says the Lord: 'In this very place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, there will dogs also lick up your blood—yours, King Ahab!''
1 Kings 21:20 And Ahab said to Elijah: 'Have you found me, my enemy?' Elijah replied: 'I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord.'
1 Kings 21:21 'Behold, I will bring disaster upon you, and I will utterly sweep away your descendants, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, even the lowest, a 'pisser against a wall', both bond and free, every last one in Israel.'
1 Kings 21:22 'And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah, because you have provoked Me to anger and have made Israel sin.'
1 Kings 21:23 'Concerning Jezebel also, the Lord has spoken, saying: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel in the open field near Jezreel.'
1 Kings 21:24 'If any of Ahab's family dies within the city, dogs will eat him. But if any of them dies in the open country, the birds of the sky will eat him.'
1 Kings 21:25 Indeed, there was no one like Ahab, who had sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord; for his wife, Jezebel, incited him and drove him to it.
1 Kings 21:26 He became truly abominable because he followed idols, and he practiced all the detestable things that the Amorites had done, whom the Lord had destroyed and removed from the presence of the children of Israel.
1 Kings 21:27 Now when Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, and he put on sackcloth over his skin, and he fasted, and he slept in sackcloth, and he walked around with a bowed head.
1 Kings 21:28 And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:
1 Kings 21:29 'Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself on My account, I will not bring this disaster in his own lifetime, but in the days of his son, I will bring the disaster upon his house.'

1 Kings 21:1 Some time after these events, Naboth, a man from Jezreel, owned a vineyard in Jezreel, right next to the palace of Ahab, the king who ruled Samaria.
1 Kings 21:2 So King Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying: "Give me your vineyard so I can turn it into a vegetable garden, because it is very close to my palace. In exchange, I will give you either a better vineyard, or, if you prefer, I will pay you its full value in silver."
1 Kings 21:3 Naboth replied to him, saying: "May the Lord forbid me from ever giving you the inheritance of my ancestors." The ancestral land was a sacred trust, not to be sold outside the family.
1 Kings 21:4 So Ahab went home, sad and indignant because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said: "I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors." King Ahab then threw himself onto his bed, turning his face to the wall, and refused to eat anything.
1 Kings 21:5 Then his wife Jezebel came in to him and asked: "Why are you so sad? Why aren't you eating anything?"
1 Kings 21:6 He answered her: "I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him: 'Give me your vineyard for money, or if you prefer, I will give you a better vineyard in exchange.' But he replied: 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"
1 Kings 21:7 Then his wife Jezebel said to him: "Are you really the great king of Israel? Get up, eat something, and cheer up! I will personally make sure you get the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
1 Kings 21:8 So Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab's name, sealed them with his royal signet ring, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city and who knew him.
1 Kings 21:9 In these letters, she commanded: "Declare a public fast, and make sure Naboth is seated prominently among the people." A fast was often called in times of public distress or when investigating a serious sin, setting the stage for a false accusation.
1 Kings 21:10 "Then, bring two wicked men—sons of Belial, meaning utterly worthless men—to testify against him, saying: 'You blasphemed God and the king!' After their testimony, take him outside the city, stone him to death, and ensure he dies."
1 Kings 21:11 The citizens of Jezreel, including the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city, did exactly as Jezebel had commanded them and as it was written in the letters she had sent.
1 Kings 21:12 They declared a public fast and seated Naboth prominently among the people.
1 Kings 21:13 Then the two evil men, those wicked sons of the devil, were brought in and made to sit opposite Naboth. They testified against him before all the people, falsely declaring: "Naboth blasphemed God and the king!" Because of this false accusation, they dragged him outside the city and stoned him to death.
1 Kings 21:14 They then sent word to Jezebel, saying: "Naboth has been stoned, and he is dead."
1 Kings 21:15 When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, she said to Ahab: "Get up, go and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, the one who refused to give it to you for money. For Naboth is no longer alive; he is dead."
1 Kings 21:16 As soon as Ahab heard this, he got up and went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, intending to take possession of it.
1 Kings 21:17 Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:
1 Kings 21:18 "Go now, and meet Ahab, the king of Israel who lives in Samaria. Look, you will find him in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone down to take possession of it."
1 Kings 21:19 "And you shall speak to him, saying: 'Thus says the Lord: Have you not both committed murder and seized possession? And beyond this, you must add: In the very place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, there also shall dogs lick up your blood.'"
1 Kings 21:20 Ahab said to Elijah: "Have you found me, my enemy?" Elijah replied: "Yes, I have found you, because you have completely sold yourself out to do evil in the sight of the Lord."
1 Kings 21:21 "Behold, I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly sweep away your descendants, and I will cut off from Ahab every male in Israel—both slave and free, the weakest and the strongest—leaving no one."
1 Kings 21:22 "And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah: because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin."
1 Kings 21:23 "Moreover, concerning Jezebel, the Lord has spoken, saying: 'Dogs shall devour Jezebel in the open field of Jezreel.'"
1 Kings 21:24 "If any of Ahab's family dies within the city, dogs will eat his body. If any of them dies in the open country, the birds of the sky will devour his body."
1 Kings 21:25 Indeed, there was no one else like Ahab, who completely sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord; his wife Jezebel constantly incited him to do so.
1 Kings 21:26 He became utterly detestable, because he followed idols, just as the Amorites had done—those whom the Lord had destroyed from the presence of the children of Israel.
1 Kings 21:27 When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put sackcloth directly over his bare skin, fasted, and even slept in sackcloth. He walked about with his head bowed down in deep humility and sorrow.
1 Kings 21:28 Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:
1 Kings 21:29 "Have you not seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Therefore, because he has humbled himself for my sake, I will not bring this disaster in his own lifetime. Instead, I will bring the disaster upon his household in the days of his son."
1 Kings 21:1 After these events, it came to pass that Naboth the Jezreelite owned a vineyard near the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria.
1 Kings 21:2 So King Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying: 'Give me your vineyard, so I can make a vegetable garden there, because it is close and near my own house. In exchange, I will give you a better vineyard; or, if it seems more convenient to you, I will buy it from you for its price in silver.'
1 Kings 21:3 But Naboth answered him: 'May the Lord forbid me from giving you the inheritance of my fathers.'
1 Kings 21:4 So Ahab came into his house, angry and indignant because of the refusal Naboth the Jezreelite had given him, saying: 'I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.' And he threw himself onto his bed, turned his face to the wall, and refused to eat any food.
1 Kings 21:5 His wife Jezebel came in to him and said: 'Why is your spirit so troubled, and why are you refusing to eat food?'
1 Kings 21:6 He answered her: 'I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and I said to him: "Give me your vineyard for money; or if you prefer, I will give you a better vineyard in exchange." But he answered: "I will not give you my vineyard."'
1 Kings 21:7 So Jezebel his wife said to him: 'Are you the King of Israel, and you allow yourself to act this way? Get up, eat your food, and be cheerful! I will secure for you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.'
1 Kings 21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his signet ring. She sent them to the elders and to the nobles who lived in Naboth's city and resided with him.
1 Kings 21:9 And she wrote this in the letters: 'Proclaim a fast, and make Naboth sit in a prominent place among the people;'
1 Kings 21:10 'and set two men, worthless scoundrels, against him to give false testimony and say: "You cursed God and the king!" Then, take him outside, stone him to death, and let him die.'
1 Kings 21:11 So the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived with him in the city, did as Jezebel had commanded them and as it was written in the letters she had sent to them.
1 Kings 21:12 They proclaimed a fast and made Naboth sit in a prominent place among the people.
1 Kings 21:13 Then they brought two worthless scoundrels, who sat opposite him and bore false testimony against him before the assembly, saying: 'Naboth cursed God and the king!' As a result, they led him outside the city and killed him with stones.
1 Kings 21:14 And they sent word to Jezebel, saying: 'Naboth has been stoned, and he is dead.'
1 Kings 21:15 When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, she spoke to Ahab, saying: 'Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, who refused to agree with you and sell it to you; for Naboth is no longer alive, but is dead.'
1 Kings 21:16 When Ahab heard that Naboth was indeed dead, he got up and went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1 Kings 21:17 Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying:
1 Kings 21:18 'Get up, and go down to meet Ahab, king of Israel, who is in Samaria. Look, he is now going down to Naboth's vineyard to take possession of it.
1 Kings 21:19 And you shall speak to him, saying: 'Thus says the Lord: "Have you murdered, and also taken possession?" And after this you shall add: 'Thus says the Lord: "In the very place where dogs licked Naboth's blood, there also will dogs lick your own blood."
1 Kings 21:20 And Ahab said to Elijah: 'Have you found me, O my enemy?'
1 Kings 21:21 And he answered: 'I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord.'
1 Kings 21:22 'Look, I will bring evil upon you and will cut off your descendants. I will destroy from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, both bond and free, and the very last in Israel.
1 Kings 21:23 'And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger and have made Israel sin.'
1 Kings 21:24 Also, concerning Jezebel, the Lord has spoken, saying: 'Dogs shall devour Jezebel in the field of Jezreel.'
1 Kings 21:25 If Ahab dies in the city, dogs will eat him; but if he dies in the open field, the birds of the sky will eat him.
1 Kings 21:26 Indeed, there was no one else like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord; for his wife Jezebel incited him to do so.
1 Kings 21:27 He became utterly detestable by following idols and all the abominable practices that the Amorites had committed, whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.
1 Kings 21:28 When Ahab heard these words, he tore his garments and put on sackcloth over his flesh. He fasted, and slept in sackcloth, and walked with his head bowed down.
1 Kings 21:29 Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 'Have you not seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Therefore, because he has humbled himself for my sake, I will not bring the evil in his own days. Instead, in the days of his son, I will bring the evil upon his house.'
1 Kings 22:1 And three years passed without any war between Syria and Israel.
1 Kings 22:2 Then, in the third year, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went down to visit the king of Israel.
1 Kings 22:3 The king of Israel then said to his servants, "Are you not aware that Ramoth-Gilead rightfully belongs to us, and yet we remain silent, allowing it to be taken from our hands?"
1 Kings 22:4 He then asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you come with me to battle at Ramoth-Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am with you, just as you are with me; my people are with your people; my horses are with your horses." This means they are fully allied.
1 Kings 22:5 Jehoshaphat then said to the king of Israel, "Please, let us inquire today for a word from the Lord."
1 Kings 22:6 So the king of Israel gathered four hundred prophets and asked them, "Should I go to Ramoth-Gilead to fight, or should I hold back?" They all responded, "Go up, and the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand."
1 Kings 22:7 Jehoshaphat then asked, "Is there not also a prophet of the Lord here, so that we may inquire through him?"
1 Kings 22:8 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is one man through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, because he never prophesies anything good for me, only evil. His name is Micaiah, the son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat replied, "Do not speak such words, my king."
1 Kings 22:9 So the king of Israel called one of his eunuchs and told him, "Go quickly and bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah."
1 Kings 22:10 Now, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were both sitting on their thrones, dressed in their royal robes, in the threshing floor area near the entrance of the gate of Samaria. All the other prophets were delivering their prophecies before them.
1 Kings 22:11 And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, had made for himself horns of iron and declared, "Thus says the Lord: 'With these horns, you will gore and scatter Syria until you have utterly destroyed them.'"
1 Kings 22:12 All the other prophets were also prophesying similarly, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and you will succeed, for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand."
1 Kings 22:13 So the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "Look, the words of all the prophets are unanimously declaring good things for the king. Therefore, let your words be like theirs, and speak good tidings."
1 Kings 22:14 Micaiah replied to him, "As the Lord lives, whatever the Lord tells me to say, that is what I will speak." This shows his unwavering commitment to God's true message.
1 Kings 22:15 So he came to the king. The king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-Gilead to fight, or should we hold back?" Micaiah replied to him, "Go up, and you will succeed; the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand."
1 Kings 22:16 The king then said to him, "I adjure you, again and again, that you speak nothing to me but what is true, in the name of the Lord." The king knew Micaiah was being sarcastic.
1 Kings 22:17 Micaiah then said: "I saw all of Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said: 'These people have no master now. Let each one return to his home in peace.'" This was a prophecy of the king's death.
1 Kings 22:18 So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he never prophesies anything good for me, but always evil?"
1 Kings 22:19 Micaiah then said, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, with all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left." This describes a heavenly council.
1 Kings 22:20 And the Lord said, "Who will entice Ahab, the king of Israel, to go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?" And one spirit said one thing, and another spirit said another.
1 Kings 22:21 Then a certain spirit came forward and stood before the Lord and said, "I will entice him." The Lord asked him, "How will you do it?"
1 Kings 22:22 And the spirit said, "I will go out and become a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets." And the Lord said, "You will entice him, and you will succeed. Go out and do as you have said." This means God allowed the deception.
1 Kings 22:23 "So now, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the Lord has decreed evil concerning you."
1 Kings 22:24 Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, approached and struck Micaiah on the cheek, saying, "Which way did the Spirit of the Lord pass from me to speak to you instead?"
1 Kings 22:25 Micaiah replied, "You will see on that day when you go into an inner room from chamber to chamber to hide yourself."
1 Kings 22:26 The king of Israel then said, "Take Micaiah and lead him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the son of Amelech."
1 Kings 22:27 "And tell them: 'Thus says the king: Put this man in prison and feed him with the bread of affliction and the water of distress until I return in peace.'"
1 Kings 22:28 Micaiah said, "If you ever return in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through me." And he added, "Hear this, all you peoples!"
1 Kings 22:29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-Gilead.
1 Kings 22:30 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
1 Kings 22:31 Now the king of Syria had commanded his thirty-two chariot commanders, saying, "Do not fight with anyone, neither small nor great, except with the king of Israel alone."
1 Kings 22:32 So when the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they assumed he was the king of Israel and turned to attack him.
1 Kings 22:33 But Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord turned them away from him, causing them to turn from pursuing Jehoshaphat.
1 Kings 22:34 However, a certain man drew his bow with careful aim and by chance struck the king of Israel between his lung and stomach. The king then said to his chariot driver, "Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded."
1 Kings 22:35 The battle raged on throughout that day, and the king of Israel remained standing in his chariot facing the Syrians. He died that evening, as the blood from his wound flowed into the floor of the chariot.
1 Kings 22:36 And a herald cried out throughout the entire army before sunset, saying, "Every man to his own city, and every man to his own land!"
1 Kings 22:37 So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.
1 Kings 22:38 And they washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria, where the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves, just as the Lord had prophesied.
1 Kings 22:39 As for the rest of the acts of Ahab, and everything he did, and the ivory house that he built, and all the cities that he constructed—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1 Kings 22:40 So Ahab rested with his ancestors, and his son Ahaziah reigned in his place.
1 Kings 22:1 Now, there were three years of peace between Syria and Israel.
1 Kings 22:2 But in the third year, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went down to visit the king of Israel.
1 Kings 22:3 The king of Israel said to his servants, "Don't you realize that Ramoth in Gilead belongs to us? Why do we remain silent and not take it back from the king of Syria?"
1 Kings 22:4 Then he said to Jehoshaphat, "Will you come with me to battle in Ramoth-Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, and my people are as your people, and my horsemen are as your horsemen. We are allies."
1 Kings 22:5 Jehoshaphat then said to the king of Israel, "Please, let us inquire of the Lord today to hear His word."
1 Kings 22:6 So the king of Israel gathered the prophets—about four hundred men—and asked them, "Should I go to Ramoth-Gilead to wage war, or should I hold back?" They all answered, "Go up, and God will give it into the king's hand."
1 Kings 22:7 Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no other prophet of the Lord here, so that we may inquire through him?"
1 Kings 22:8 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is one man through whom we could inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, because he never prophesies anything good for me, only evil. That man is Micaiah, the son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat responded, "The king should not speak like that."
1 Kings 22:9 So the king of Israel called one of his officials and ordered him, "Quickly, bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah."
1 Kings 22:10 The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were sitting, each on his throne, dressed in their royal robes, in the open space at the entrance to the gate of Samaria. All the other prophets were prophesying before them.
1 Kings 22:11 Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself iron horns and declared, "Thus says the Lord: 'With these, you will gore the Syrians until you utterly destroy them.'"
1 Kings 22:12 All the other prophets prophesied similarly, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-Gilead! You will succeed in everything, and the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand."
1 Kings 22:13 The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "Look, the words of the prophets are uniformly favorable for the king. So let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably."
1 Kings 22:14 Micaiah replied, "As the Lord lives, I will speak only what the Lord tells me to say."
1 Kings 22:15 When he came to the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-Gilead to wage war, or should we hold back?" Micaiah answered him, "Go up, and you will succeed in everything, and the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand." This was said with sarcasm.
1 Kings 22:16 The king said, "How many times must I make you swear by God that you will tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?"
1 Kings 22:17 Micaiah then said, "I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, 'These people have no leader. Let each one return to his house in peace.'"
1 Kings 22:18 The king of Israel then said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good for me, but always evil?"
1 Kings 22:19 Micaiah continued, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left."
1 Kings 22:20 And the Lord said, "Who will entice Ahab, the king of Israel, so that he goes up and falls in Ramoth-Gilead?" One spirit suggested one thing, and another suggested a different method.
1 Kings 22:21 Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, saying, "I will entice him." The Lord asked him, "How will you do it?"
1 Kings 22:22 The spirit replied, "I will go out and become a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets." The Lord said, "You will entice him, and you will succeed. Go out and do so."
1 Kings 22:23 Now therefore, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours who are here. And the Lord has spoken disaster against you.
1 Kings 22:24 Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came up and struck Micaiah on the cheek, saying, "Which way did the Spirit of the Lord leave me to speak to you?"
1 Kings 22:25 Micaiah answered, "You will see on that day when you go into an inner room, hiding from everyone, trying to escape."
1 Kings 22:26 The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and lead him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son."
1 Kings 22:27 And tell them, "The king says: 'Put this man in prison and feed him only meager rations of bread and water until I return victorious and in peace.'"
1 Kings 22:28 Micaiah declared, "If you ever return in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through me." And he added, "Listen, all you people!"
1 Kings 22:29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-Gilead.
1 Kings 22:30 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself before I enter the battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
1 Kings 22:31 The king of Syria had commanded his thirty-two chariot commanders, saying, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except for the king of Israel alone."
1 Kings 22:32 So when the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they assumed he was the king of Israel, and they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out.
1 Kings 22:33 The chariot commanders realized that he was not the king of Israel, so they turned away from pursuing him.
1 Kings 22:34 But a certain man drew his bow at random, without aiming, and struck the king of Israel between his lung and his stomach. The king said to his chariot driver, "Turn your hand, and take me out of the battle line, because I am severely wounded."
1 Kings 22:35 The battle intensified throughout that day. The king of Israel remained propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians. He died in the evening, and the blood from his wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.
1 Kings 22:36 At sunset, a proclamation was made throughout the entire army, saying, "Every man return to his city, and every man to his own land!"
1 Kings 22:37 So the king died, and he was brought to Samaria. They buried the king in Samaria.
1 Kings 22:38 When they washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria, the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots bathed in that very water—just as the Lord had prophesied would happen.
1 Kings 22:39 Now, the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory palace he built, and all the works he accomplished, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
1 Kings 22:40 So Ahab slept with his fathers—meaning he died—and Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place.
1 Kings 22:1 And three years passed without any war between the kingdom of Syria and the kingdom of Israel.
1 Kings 22:2 Then, in the third year, Josaphat, who was the king of Judah, went down to visit the king of Israel.
1 Kings 22:3 Now, the king of Israel spoke to his servants, saying: "Do you not know that the city of Ramoth Galaad belongs to us? Yet we remain silent, doing nothing to prevent it from being taken from our hands!"
1 Kings 22:4 And the king of Israel then asked Josaphat: "Will you come with me to fight in battle against Ramoth Galaad?"
1 Kings 22:5 Josaphat replied to the king of Israel: "I am with you as if I were you. My people are with you as if they were your people, and my horses are with you as if they were your horses—we are united as one." This was Josaphat's promise of military alliance.
1 Kings 22:6 Josaphat then said to the king of Israel: "Please, I beg you, let us inquire today for a word from the Lord."
1 Kings 22:7 So the king of Israel gathered about four hundred of his own prophets and asked them: "Should I go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or should I hold back?" They all answered him: "Go up into battle! The Lord will give the city into the king's hand."
1 Kings 22:8 But Josaphat asked: "Is there no other true prophet of the Lord here through whom we can inquire further?"
1 Kings 22:9 The king of Israel replied to Josaphat: "There is one more man by whom we could inquire of the Lord, but I hate him. He never prophesies anything good for me, only evil. His name is Michæas, the son of Jemla." Josaphat responded, saying: "The king should not speak like that!"
1 Kings 22:10 So the king of Israel called one of his eunuchs and ordered him: "Hurry and bring Michæas, the son of Jemla, here!"
1 Kings 22:11 Now the king of Israel and Josaphat, the king of Judah, were sitting, each on his own throne. They were dressed in their royal robes in the open area near the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them, delivering their messages.
1 Kings 22:12 Indeed, Sedecias, the son of Chanana, had made himself horns of iron and declared: "This is what the Lord says: With these horns you will push Syria until you completely destroy them."
1 Kings 22:13 And all the other prophets prophesied similarly, saying: "Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and you will be successful! The Lord will give it into the king's hand."
1 Kings 22:14 But the messenger who had gone to summon Michæas spoke to him, saying: "Look, the words of the prophets are all proclaiming good things to the king with one voice. So let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably."
1 Kings 22:15 Michæas responded to the messenger: "As the Lord lives, I will speak only whatever the Lord tells me."
1 Kings 22:16 So when he came before the king, the king asked him: "Michæas, should we go to Ramoth Galaad to wage war, or should we hold back?"
1 Kings 22:17 Michæas answered him, speaking sarcastically: "Go up, and you will be successful! The Lord will give it into the king's hand!"
1 Kings 22:18 The king then said: "How many times must I warn you and adjure you under oath, that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?"
1 Kings 22:19 Michæas replied: "I saw all of Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said: 'These people have no master. Let each one return to his own home in peace.'" This was a prophecy of the king's death.
1 Kings 22:20 Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat: "Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but always evil?"
1 Kings 22:21 But Michæas continued, saying: "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting upon His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left."
1 Kings 22:22 And the Lord asked: 'Who will deceive Achab, the king of Israel, so that he will go up to Ramoth Galaad and fall there?' And one spirit spoke these words, and another spoke other words.
1 Kings 22:23 Then a certain spirit came forth and stood before the Lord and said: 'I will deceive him.' The Lord asked him: 'How will you do it?'
1 Kings 22:24 And the spirit said: 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' The Lord then said: 'You will deceive him, and you will prevail. Go out and do it in this manner.'
1 Kings 22:25 Now therefore, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and the Lord has spoken evil concerning you.
1 Kings 22:26 Then Sedecias, the son of Chanana, approached and struck Michæas on the cheek, saying: "By what way did the Spirit of the Lord depart from me to speak to you instead?"
1 Kings 22:27 Michæas responded: "Behold, you will see on that day, when you go from chamber to inner chamber to hide yourself—fleeing from the battle."
1 Kings 22:28 And the king of Israel commanded: "Take Michæas and lead him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joas, the son of Amelech."
1 Kings 22:29 And say: 'This is what the king says: Put this man in prison and feed him with the bread of affliction and the water of distress, until I return victorious and in peace.'"
1 Kings 22:30 Michæas then declared: "If you indeed return victorious and in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through me." And he added: "Hear this, all you peoples!"
1 Kings 22:31 So the king of Israel and Josaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth Galaad.
1 Kings 22:32 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: "You, disguise yourself by putting on other clothes. But I will disguise myself in a different manner and then go into battle." So the king of Israel changed his royal attire and went into the war.
1 Kings 22:33 Now the king of Syria had commanded his thirty-two chariot captains, saying: "Do not fight against anyone, neither small nor great, except against the king of Israel alone."
1 Kings 22:34 When the chariot captains saw Josaphat, they assumed and said: "This must be the king of Israel!" So they turned to attack him in battle, and Josaphat cried out for help.
1 Kings 22:35 And the chariot captains realized that it was not the king of Israel, so they turned away from pursuing him.
1 Kings 22:36 However, a certain man drew his bow and, shooting an arrow randomly, struck the king of Israel between the shoulder armor and the breastplate. The king then cried out to his chariot driver: "Turn around and take me out of this battle, because I have been seriously wounded!"
1 Kings 22:37 And the battle raged fiercely throughout that day. The king of Israel remained standing in his chariot, facing the Syrians, until he died at evening. The blood from his wound flowed out onto the floor of the chariot.
1 Kings 22:38 After his body was brought to Samaria, they buried the king in Samaria.
1 Kings 22:39 His chariot was then washed in the pool of Samaria. The dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves there. This happened exactly according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through His prophet Michæas.
1 Kings 22:40 As for the rest of the acts of Achab, and all that he did, including the ivory house he built and all the cities he constructed, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 1:1 After Ahab died, the nation of Moab revolted against Israel.
2 Kings 1:2 Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper chamber, which he had in Samaria, and he became very ill. He then sent messengers, telling them: "Go, consult Beelzebub, the idol-god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this sickness."
2 Kings 1:3 However, the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: "Get up and go meet the messengers of the king of Samaria. Then you shall say to them: 'Is there truly no God in Israel that you must go to consult Beelzebub, the idol-god of Ekron?'"
2 Kings 1:4 Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'You will not leave the bed upon which you have climbed, but you will surely die.' And Elijah then departed.
2 Kings 1:5 And the messengers returned to Ahaziah. He asked them: "Why have you returned?"
2 Kings 1:6 They answered him: "A man met us and spoke to us, saying: 'Go, and return to the king who sent you, and speak to him: Thus says the Lord: "Is there truly no God in Israel that you send to consult Beelzebub, the idol-god of Ekron? Therefore, from the bed upon which you have climbed, you shall not descend, but you will surely die."'
2 Kings 1:7 Ahaziah asked them: "What was the appearance and manner of that man who met you and spoke these words to you?"
2 Kings 1:8 And they told him: "He was a hairy man, with a leather belt wrapped around his waist." The king immediately knew and said: "It is Elijah the Tishbite!"
2 Kings 1:9 So the king sent a captain of fifty soldiers with his fifty men to Elijah. The captain went up to him, and Elijah was sitting on the top of a mountain. And the captain spoke to him: "Man of God, the king commands that you come down!"
2 Kings 1:10 And Elijah responded, saying to the captain of fifty: "If I am a man of God, then let fire descend from the sky and consume you and your fifty men." And immediately fire descended from the sky, and it consumed him and the fifty men who were with him.
2 Kings 1:11 Again, the king sent to him a second captain of fifty soldiers with his fifty men. He spoke to Elijah: "Man of God, this is what the king says: 'Hurry, come down!'"
2 Kings 1:12 And Elijah responded, saying: "If I am a man of God, then let fire descend from the sky and consume you and your fifty men." And immediately fire descended from the sky, and it consumed him and the fifty men who were with him.
2 Kings 1:13 Again, the king sent a third captain of fifty soldiers with his fifty men. When he came, he knelt before Elijah and pleaded with him, saying: "Man of God, please do not despise my life, nor the lives of these fifty servants of yours."
2 Kings 1:14 He continued: "Behold, fire has descended from the sky and consumed the first two captains of fifty and the fifty men who were under each of them. But now, I beg you, have mercy on my life!"
2 Kings 1:15 And the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying: "Go down with him, do not be afraid." So Elijah rose up and went down with him to the king.
2 Kings 1:16 And Elijah spoke to the king: "Thus says the Lord: 'Because you sent messengers to consult Beelzebub, the idol-god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel whose word could be inquired of, therefore you will not leave the bed upon which you have climbed, but you will surely die.'"
2 Kings 1:17 So Ahaziah died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. And Joram, his brother, reigned in his place in the second year of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.
2 Kings 1:18 As for the rest of the deeds of Ahaziah, and what he accomplished, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

2 Kings 1:1 After King Ahab died, the kingdom of Moab rebelled against the kingdom of Israel.
2 Kings 1:2 Now King Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper chamber, which he had in Samaria, and he became very sick. He then sent messengers, telling them, 'Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this illness.'
2 Kings 1:3 But the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'Arise, and go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and you shall say to them: Is there no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'
2 Kings 1:4 Therefore, this is what the Lord says: 'From the bed upon which you have climbed, you shall not descend, but you will surely die.' And Elijah went away to deliver this message.
2 Kings 1:5 So the messengers returned to King Ahaziah. And he said to them, 'Why have you returned so quickly?'
2 Kings 1:6 And they answered, 'A man met us and said to us: 'Go, and return to the king who sent you, and you shall tell him: This is what the Lord says: Is there no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore, from the bed upon which you have climbed, you shall not descend, but you will surely die.''
2 Kings 1:7 And the king said to them, 'What kind of man was he who met you and spoke these words?'
2 Kings 1:8 And they described him, saying, 'He was a hairy man, with a leather belt fastened around his waist.' And the king immediately realized, 'It is Elijah the Tishbite.'
2 Kings 1:9 So the king sent a captain of fifty men, with his fifty soldiers who were under him, to Elijah. The captain went up to Elijah; and behold, Elijah was sitting on the top of a mountain. And the captain spoke to him, saying, 'Man of God, the king commands that you come down.'
2 Kings 1:10 And Elijah answered the captain of fifty, 'If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty men.' So fire came down from the sky and consumed him and the fifty men who were with him.
2 Kings 1:11 Again, King Ahaziah sent another captain of fifty men and fifty with him. And that captain spoke to Elijah, 'Man of God, the king says this: 'Hurry, come down!''
2 Kings 1:12 And Elijah answered him, 'If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty men.' Therefore, fire came down from the sky and consumed that captain and the fifty men who were with him.
2 Kings 1:13 Again, King Ahaziah sent a third captain of fifty men, with the fifty who were with him. When this captain came, he knelt down before Elijah, and pleaded with him, and spoke: 'Man of God, please do not despise my life, nor the lives of these fifty servants of yours.'
2 Kings 1:14 'For behold, fire has come down from the sky and consumed the two former captains of fifty and the fifty men who were with them. But now, I beg you, have mercy on my life.'
2 Kings 1:15 Then the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying, 'Go down with him; do not be afraid.' So Elijah arose and went down with the captain to the king,
2 Kings 1:16 and he spoke to King Ahaziah: 'This is what the Lord says: 'Because you sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel whose word you could inquire of, therefore, from the bed upon which you have climbed, you shall not descend, but you will surely die.''
2 Kings 1:17 So King Ahaziah died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. And his brother Jehoram (Joram) reigned in his place in the second year of Jehoram, the son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son.
2 Kings 1:18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 1:19 Now it came to pass, when the Lord was about to take Elijah up to the sky in a whirlwind, that Elijah and Elisha were going from Gilgal.
2 Kings 1:20 And Elijah said to Elisha, 'Please stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.' Elisha replied to him, 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' And when they had gone down to Bethel,
2 Kings 1:21 the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And Elisha responded, 'Yes, I know; be silent about it.'
2 Kings 1:22 And Elijah said to Elisha, 'Elisha, please stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as Jericho.' And Elisha replied, 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' And when they had come to Jericho,
2 Kings 1:23 the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And Elisha replied, 'Yes, I know; be silent about it.'
2 Kings 1:24 And Elijah said to him, 'Please stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as the Jordan River.' Elisha replied, 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' So both of them continued on their journey.
2 Kings 1:25 Furthermore, fifty men from the sons of the prophets followed them; and they stood facing them, from a distance, while Elijah and Elisha both stood by the Jordan.
2 Kings 1:26 Then Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the waters of the Jordan, which then divided to both sides. And both Elijah and Elisha crossed over on dry ground.
2 Kings 1:27 When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, 'Ask what you desire for me to do for you, before I am taken from you.' And Elisha said, 'I beg you, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.'
2 Kings 1:28 Elijah answered, 'You have asked a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be granted to you as you have asked; but if you do not see me, it will not be granted.'
2 Kings 1:29 As they walked on and talked together, behold, a fiery chariot and fiery horses appeared and separated the two of them. And Elijah ascended by a whirlwind into the sky.
2 Kings 1:30 But Elisha, seeing this, cried out, 'My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its horsemen!' And he saw Elijah no longer. Then Elisha took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.
2 Kings 1:31 And Elisha picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him. Then he returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan River.
2 Kings 1:32 And with the mantle of Elijah, which had fallen from him, Elisha struck the waters, but they did not divide. Then he said, 'Where is the God of Elijah now?' And again he struck the waters, and they divided to one side and to the other; and Elisha crossed over.
2 Kings 1:33 Now when the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho saw him from a distance, they said, 'The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha.' And coming to meet him, they bowed down to the ground before him,
2 Kings 1:34 and they said to him, 'Behold, we have fifty strong men with us who can go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys.' But Elisha replied, 'Do not send them.'
2 Kings 1:35 But they urged him until he consented, saying, 'Send them.' So they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find Elijah.
2 Kings 1:36 When they returned to Elisha, who was still waiting in Jericho, he said to them, 'Did I not tell you: 'Do not send them?'
2 Kings 1:37 Now the men of the city of Jericho also said to Elisha, 'Behold, the dwelling place of this city is excellent, as you yourself, our lord, perceive. But the waters are very bad, and the land is barren.'
2 Kings 1:38 And Elisha said, 'Bring me a new jar and put salt in it.' So when they brought it to him,
2 Kings 1:39 he went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into it, and said: 'This is what the Lord says: 'I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more death or barrenness in them from now on.''
2 Kings 1:40 So the waters were healed to this very day, according to the word of Elisha, which he had spoken.
2 Kings 1:1 But after King Ahab died, the kingdom of Moab rebelled against Israel.
2 Kings 1:2 But King Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room, which he had in Samaria, and became gravely ill. So he sent messengers, telling them, 'Go, consult Beelzebub, the pagan god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this illness.'
2 Kings 1:3 However, the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, instructing him: 'Go now, ascend to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them: "Is there no God in Israel, that you must go and consult Beelzebub, the pagan god of Ekron?"'
2 Kings 1:4 Therefore, the Lord declares this: 'You shall not get up from the sickbed you are on; instead, you will certainly die.' With this message, Elijah departed.
2 Kings 1:5 When the messengers returned to King Ahaziah, he asked them, 'Why have you come back?'
2 Kings 1:6 They answered him, 'A man met us and told us, "Go back to the king who sent you, and tell him: 'This is what the Lord says: Is there no God in Israel, that you must send to consult Beelzebub, the pagan god of Ekron? Because of this, you will not get up from the sickbed you are on; instead, you will certainly die.'"'
2 Kings 1:7 He then asked them, 'What kind of man was it who met you and spoke these words to you?'
2 Kings 1:8 They replied, 'He was a man dressed in a rough, hairy garment, with a leather belt around his waist.' The king then realized, 'It is Elijah the Tishbite!'
2 Kings 1:9 So the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty soldiers. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a mountain, and addressed him, 'Man of God, the king commands you: "Come down!"'
2 Kings 1:10 Elijah answered the captain of fifty, 'If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume both you and your fifty men.' Immediately, fire descended from the sky and consumed him and all fifty of his soldiers.
2 Kings 1:11 Again, the king sent another captain of fifty with his fifty soldiers. This captain addressed Elijah, 'Man of God, this is what the king says: "Hurry, come down!"'
2 Kings 1:12 Elijah answered him, 'If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume both you and your fifty men.' Immediately, fire descended from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers.
2 Kings 1:13 Once more, the king sent a third captain of fifty with his fifty soldiers. When this captain arrived, he humbly knelt before Elijah and pleaded with him, saying, 'Man of God, please do not disregard my life, nor the lives of these fifty servants of yours.'
2 Kings 1:14 Behold, fire has already come down from the sky and consumed the first two captains of fifty with their fifty men. Now, I beg you, spare my life.
2 Kings 1:15 Then the Angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah, saying, 'Go down with him; do not be afraid.' So Elijah rose, and went down with the captain to the king.
2 Kings 1:16 Elijah then spoke to the king, saying, 'This is what the Lord declares: Because you sent messengers to consult Beelzebub, the pagan god of Ekron, as if there were no God in Israel from whom you could seek a prophetic word, you will not get up from the sickbed you are on; instead, you will certainly die.'
2 Kings 1:17 So King Ahaziah died according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken. His brother Joram then reigned in his place, because Ahaziah had no son. This occurred in the second year of Joram, son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah.
2 Kings 1:18 As for the rest of the acts of King Ahaziah, and all that he did, are they not indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 2:1 Now it came about, when the Lord was about to take Elijah up into glory by means of a whirlwind, that Elijah and Elisha departed from Gilgal.
2 Kings 2:2 And Elijah said to Elisha: 'Stay here, I beg you, because the Lord has sent me on a mission to Bethel.' And Elisha replied: 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' So they both went down to Bethel.
2 Kings 2:3 Then the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him: 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And he answered: 'Yes, I know; be silent.'
2 Kings 2:4 And Elijah said to Elisha: 'Stay here, I beg you, because the Lord has sent me on a mission to Jericho.' But he replied: 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' So they both went to Jericho.
2 Kings 2:5 Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho approached Elisha and said to him: 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And he replied: 'Yes, I know; be silent.'
2 Kings 2:6 And Elijah said to him: 'Stay here, I beg you, because the Lord has sent me on a mission as far as the Jordan River.' But he replied: 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.' So they both continued on their way.
2 Kings 2:7 And fifty men from the sons of the prophets followed them and stood at a distance, watching them. But Elijah and Elisha both stood by the Jordan River.
2 Kings 2:8 Then Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the waters of the river. And the waters divided to both sides, so that both of them crossed over on dry ground.
2 Kings 2:9 And when they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha: 'Ask what you wish me to do for you before I am taken from you.' And Elisha replied: 'I beg that a double portion of your spiritual power may come upon me.'
2 Kings 2:10 He answered: 'You have asked a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, then what you have asked will be granted to you. But if you do not see me, it will not be.'
2 Kings 2:11 And as they continued on their way, speaking together as they walked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah ascended into glory by means of a whirlwind.
2 Kings 2:12 But Elisha saw it, and he cried out: 'My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its horsemen!' And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.
2 Kings 2:13 And he picked up the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him. Then he returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan River.
2 Kings 2:14 And with the cloak of Elijah, which had fallen from him, he struck the waters, but they did not divide. Then he said: 'Where is the God of Elijah now?' And he struck the waters again, and they divided to both sides. So Elisha crossed over.
2 Kings 2:15 Now when the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho saw him from across the river, they said: 'The spiritual power of Elijah rests upon Elisha.' And they came to meet him, bowing down to the ground before him.
2 Kings 2:16 And they said to him: 'Behold, there are fifty strong men among your servants, who could go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon one of the mountains or into one of the valleys.' But he said: 'Do not send anyone.'
2 Kings 2:17 But they urged him until he consented and said: 'Send them.' So they sent fifty men, and after they had searched for three days, they did not find him.
2 Kings 2:18 And when they returned to Elisha, who was sitting in Jericho, he said to them: 'Did I not tell you, 'Do not send anyone?'
2 Kings 2:19 Then the men of the city said to Elisha: 'Behold, the situation of this city is excellent, as you yourself, my master, can see. But the waters are bad, and the land is barren.'
2 Kings 2:20 And he said: 'Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it.' And when they had brought it to him,
2 Kings 2:21 he went to the spring of waters and cast the salt into it, and said: 'Thus says the Lord: I have healed these waters. From now on, there will be no more death or barrenness in them.'
2 Kings 2:22 So the waters were healed to this very day, according to the word of Elisha, which he had spoken.
2 Kings 2:23 And from there he went up to Bethel. And as he was going up by the way, some small boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying: 'Go up, you bald head! Go up, you bald head!'
2 Kings 2:24 When he looked back, he saw them and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two she-bears came out of the forest and mauled forty-two of the boys.
2 Kings 2:25 And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
2 Kings 2:1 When the Lord was about to take Elijah up into the heavens by means of a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal.
2 Kings 2:2 And Elijah said to Elisha, 'Please, stay here, because the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.' To which Elisha replied, 'As the Lord lives, and as your very self lives, I will not leave you.' So they both went down to Bethel.
2 Kings 2:3 Then the company of prophets who were in Bethel came out to meet Elisha, and they asked him, 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' And he replied, 'Yes, I know that also; be silent.'
2 Kings 2:4 Then Elijah said to Elisha again, 'Elisha, please stay here, because the Lord has sent me as far as Jericho.' But Elisha insisted, 'As the Lord lives, and as your very self lives, I will not leave you.' So they both went on to Jericho.
2 Kings 2:5 And the company of prophets who were in Jericho came to Elisha and asked him, 'Do you know that today the Lord is taking your master from you?' He replied, 'Yes, I know that also; be silent.'
2 Kings 2:6 Then Elijah said to him, 'Please, cross the Jordan, and stay here, because the Lord has sent me as far as the Jordan River.' But Elisha affirmed again, 'As the Lord lives, and as your very self lives, I will not leave you.' So both of them continued on their way.
2 Kings 2:7 And fifty men from the company of prophets followed them and stood watching from a distance, directly opposite them. But Elijah and Elisha themselves stood by the Jordan River.
2 Kings 2:8 Then Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the waters of the Jordan. The waters parted to both sides, and both Elijah and Elisha crossed over on dry ground.
2 Kings 2:9 When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, 'Ask what you wish for me to do for you, before I am taken from you.' Elisha then replied, 'I beg you, let a double portion of your prophetic spirit be upon me.'
2 Kings 2:10 Elijah responded, 'You have asked a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, then what you have asked will be granted to you. But if you do not see me, it will not be.'
2 Kings 2:11 And as they continued on their way, still talking, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them. Then Elijah went up into the heavens by means of a whirlwind.
2 Kings 2:12 But Elisha saw it, and he cried out, 'My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its horseman!' —a declaration of Israel's strength and Elijah's importance. And he saw Elijah no more. Then, in his grief, Elisha took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.
2 Kings 2:13 Then Elisha picked up Elijah’s mantle, which had fallen from him. He turned back and stood by the bank of the Jordan River.
2 Kings 2:14 And with Elijah’s mantle, which had fallen from him, he struck the waters of the Jordan, but they did not part. So Elisha cried out, 'Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah, now?' He then struck the waters again, and they parted to both sides, and Elisha crossed over.
2 Kings 2:15 When the company of prophets from Jericho, who had been watching from across the river, saw this, they declared, 'The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha!' And they came to meet him, bowing down before him with their faces to the ground.
2 Kings 2:16 And they said to him, 'Behold, your servants have fifty strong men with us who could go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon one of the mountains or into one of the valleys.' But Elisha said, 'Do not send them.'
2 Kings 2:17 But they urged him so persistently that he finally gave in and said, 'Send them.' So they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.
2 Kings 2:18 When they returned to Elisha — for he was staying in Jericho — he said to them, 'Did I not tell you, 'Do not send them?'
2 Kings 2:19 Then the men of the city of Jericho said to Elisha, 'Behold, the situation of this city is excellent, as you yourself, our master, can see. But its waters are very bad, and the land is unproductive.'
2 Kings 2:20 But Elisha said, 'Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.' So they brought it to him.
2 Kings 2:21 Then Elisha went out to the spring of the waters, and he cast the salt into it, declaring, 'Thus says the Lord: 'I have now healed these waters. From this moment on, there will be no more death nor barrenness from them.'' 
2 Kings 2:22 And the waters have remained healed to this very day, according to the prophetic word that Elisha spoke.
2 Kings 2:23 From there, Elisha went up towards Bethel. As he was going up by the road, some young lads came out from the city and began to mock him, shouting, 'Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!' — a taunt challenging his authority and connection to Elijah's ascent.
2 Kings 2:24 And when Elisha turned and looked at them, he saw them and cursed them in the name of the Lord. Immediately, two she-bears came out of the nearby forest and attacked them, tearing apart forty-two of the boys.
2 Kings 2:25 Then Elisha went from there to Mount Carmel, and from Mount Carmel, he returned to Samaria.
2 Kings 3:1 Moab, however, rebelled against Israel after Ahab's death.
2 Kings 3:2 And Joram, Ahab's son, became king over Israel in Samaria during the twelfth year of Jehoshaphat, who was king of Judah. Joram reigned for twelve years.
2 Kings 3:3 He did what was evil in the Lord's sight, though not to the same extent as his father Ahab or his mother Jezebel. For Joram removed the stone pillars of Baal that his father had set up.
2 Kings 3:4 Now Mesha, the king of Moab, was a sheep breeder, and he used to pay tribute to the king of Israel: a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams with their wool.
2 Kings 3:5 But after Ahab died, Moab broke the treaty they had with the king of Israel.
2 Kings 3:6 So King Joram left Samaria that day and took a census of Israel's fighting men.
2 Kings 3:7 He then sent a message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying, 'The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you come with me to fight against Moab?' Jehoshaphat replied, 'I will go up with you. My forces are like your forces, my people like your people, and my horses like your horses.'
2 Kings 3:8 Then Joram asked, 'By what route should we advance?' And Jehoshaphat answered, 'By way of the desert of Edom.'
2 Kings 3:9 So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out. They marched for seven days, but there was no water for their army or for the animals that followed them.
2 Kings 3:10 Then the king of Israel cried out, 'Oh no! Has the Lord called these three kings together only to deliver them into the hand of Moab?'
2 Kings 3:11 But Jehoshaphat asked, 'Is there no prophet of the Lord here through whom we might consult the Lord?' One of the servants of the king of Israel replied, 'Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here. He used to pour water on Elijah's hands'—meaning he was Elijah's personal assistant and successor.
2 Kings 3:12 Jehoshaphat then declared, 'The Lord's message is indeed with him.' So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to meet Elisha.
2 Kings 3:13 Elisha said to the king of Israel, 'What business do you and I have together? Go to the prophets of your father and your mother!' The king of Israel answered him, 'No, for the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.'
2 Kings 3:14 Elisha declared, 'As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, if I did not respect the presence of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, I would not even look at you or acknowledge you.'
2 Kings 3:15 But now, bring me a harpist. And as the harpist played, the hand of the Lord came upon Elisha.
2 Kings 3:16 And he said, 'Thus says the Lord: Dig many trenches in this dry streambed.'
2 Kings 3:17 For thus says the Lord: 'You will neither see wind nor rain, yet this streambed will be filled with water, so that you, your troops, and your animals may drink.'
2 Kings 3:18 And this is but a small thing in the Lord's sight. He will also deliver Moab into your hands.
2 Kings 3:19 You will strike every fortified city and every excellent city. You will cut down every fruit tree, stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good field with stones.
2 Kings 3:20 So it happened in the morning, at the time when the sacrifice was offered, that behold, water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.
2 Kings 3:21 Now all the Moabites, hearing that the kings had come up to fight against them, gathered everyone who could put on a belt for battle and stood at their border.
2 Kings 3:22 When they rose early in the morning, and the sun was shining opposite them, the Moabites saw the water in the distance, appearing to them like blood.
2 Kings 3:23 And they said, 'This is blood! The kings must have fought with their swords and killed each other. Now, Moab, to the plunder!'
2 Kings 3:24 But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, who fled before them. The Israelites pursued them and continued to strike Moab.
2 Kings 3:25 They destroyed their cities and filled every good field with stones by throwing them. They stopped up every spring of water and cut down every fruit tree. So only the walls of stones were left in Kir-hareseth. Then the forces surrounded the city with slingers and attacked it.
2 Kings 3:26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom's position, but they were unable.
2 Kings 3:27 Then he took his eldest son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the city wall. This act caused great wrath to fall upon Israel. Immediately, they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.
2 Kings 3:1 Joram, the son of Ahab, began to rule over Israel in Samaria during the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. He reigned for twelve years.
2 Kings 3:2 He did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not to the extent of his father and mother, for he removed the stone column of Baal that his father had made.
2 Kings 3:3 Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin, and he did not turn away from them.
2 Kings 3:4 Now Mesa, the king of Moab, was a sheep breeder. He used to pay the king of Israel a tribute of one hundred thousand lambs, and one hundred thousand rams with their wool.
2 Kings 3:5 But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
2 Kings 3:6 So King Joram left Samaria that very day and reviewed all the men of Israel.
2 Kings 3:7 He went and sent a message to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying: 'The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you come with me to fight against Moab?' Jehoshaphat replied: 'I will go up with you. My people are like your people, and my horses are like your horses.'
2 Kings 3:8 Joram then asked: 'By which way should we march up?' Jehoshaphat answered: 'Through the way of the desert of Edom.'
2 Kings 3:9 So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom went forth. They marched in a roundabout way for seven days, and there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.
2 Kings 3:10 The king of Israel cried out: 'Alas, alas! Has the Lord called these three kings together only to deliver them into the hand of Moab?'
2 Kings 3:11 Then Jehoshaphat asked: 'Is there no prophet of the Lord here, that we may inquire of the Lord through him?' One of the servants of the king of Israel answered: 'Elisha, the son of Shaphat, is here, he who poured water over the hands of Elijah.'
2 Kings 3:12 And Jehoshaphat said: 'The word of the Lord is with him.' So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.
2 Kings 3:13 Elisha said to the king of Israel: 'What concern have I with you? Go to the prophets of your father and your mother.' The king of Israel replied to him: 'No, because the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab!'
2 Kings 3:14 Then Elisha said: 'As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, if it were not for my respect for Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, I would not even give you attention or look at you.'
2 Kings 3:15 Now, bring me a harpist. And when the harpist played, the hand of the Lord came upon Elisha.
2 Kings 3:16 And he said: 'Thus says the Lord: Make this valley full of ditches, dig many ditches.'
2 Kings 3:17 For thus says the Lord: 'You will not see wind, nor will you see rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your livestock, and your flocks will drink.'
2 Kings 3:18 And this is but a small thing in the sight of the Lord: He will also deliver Moab into your hands.
2 Kings 3:19 You will strike every fortified city and every excellent city. You will cut down every fruitful tree, and you will stop up all springs of water, and you will ruin every good field with stones.
2 Kings 3:20 So it came to pass in the morning, at the time when the sacrifice is usually offered, that suddenly water came by the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.
2 Kings 3:21 Now all the Moabites, hearing that the kings had come up to fight against them, gathered together everyone who could put on armor, from young men to old, and they stood at their borders.
2 Kings 3:22 Rising early in the morning, as the sun rose opposite the water, the Moabites saw the water from afar, red like blood.
2 Kings 3:23 And they said: 'This is the blood of the sword! The kings must have fought against each other and killed one another. Now, Moab, to the plunder!'
2 Kings 3:24 But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, who fled before them. They pursued them, striking down and devastating Moab.
2 Kings 3:25 They also destroyed the cities, and every good field they filled with stones by each man throwing a stone. They stopped up all the springs of water and cut down every fruitful tree, so that only the walls of the city of Kir Haraseth remained. The slingers surrounded it and struck it.
2 Kings 3:26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords to break through to the king of Edom, but he could not.
2 Kings 3:27 Then he took his firstborn son, who was to reign in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation in Israel. Immediately, they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.
2 Kings 3:1 Moab rebelled against Israel after King Achab died.
2 Kings 3:2 Now Joram, son of Achab, began his reign over Israel in Samaria during the eighteenth year of Josaphat's kingship in Judah, and Joram reigned for twelve years.
2 Kings 3:3 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, yet not to the same degree as his father and mother had done, for he had removed the idols of Baal that his father had erected.
2 Kings 3:4 Now Mesa, the king of Moab, was a wealthy sheep breeder, and he was required to pay the king of Israel a tribute of one hundred thousand lambs and one hundred thousand rams with their wool.
2 Kings 3:5 But when King Achab had died, Mesa, the king of Moab, openly rebelled against the king of Israel.
2 Kings 3:6 So King Joram marched out from Samaria at that time and mustered all the fighting men of Israel.
2 Kings 3:7 And Joram sent a message to Josaphat, the king of Judah, saying: 'The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you come with me to Moab to wage war?' Josaphat replied: 'I will indeed go with you. My resources are entirely at your disposal, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.'
2 Kings 3:8 Then Joram asked, 'By what route should our army advance?' And Josaphat replied, 'We should go through the desert route of Edom.'
2 Kings 3:9 So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom began their march. After they had traveled for seven days, there was no water left for their army or for the animals that accompanied them.
2 Kings 3:10 Then the king of Israel cried out, 'Oh no! Has the Lord truly brought these three kings together just to deliver us into the hand of Moab?'
2 Kings 3:11 Then Josaphat asked, 'Is there no prophet of the Lord present here, through whom we might inquire of the Lord's will?' One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, saying: 'Elisha, the son of Saphat, is here. He is the one who used to pour water on Elijah’s hands, serving him as a disciple.'
2 Kings 3:12 Josaphat then declared, 'The Lord's message is truly with him.' So the king of Israel, Josaphat, and the king of Edom went down to Elisha.
2 Kings 3:13 Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, 'What business do I have with you? Go to the prophets of your father and your mother, the prophets of Baal!' But the king of Israel pleaded with him, 'It is because the Lord has truly called these three kings together only to deliver us into the hand of Moab!'
2 Kings 3:14 Then Elisha declared: 'As the Lord of hosts lives, before Whom I stand in service, if it were not for my respect for Josaphat, the king of Judah, I would not even look at you nor acknowledge your presence!'
2 Kings 3:15 Now, therefore, bring me a musician to play a stringed instrument.' And while the musician played, the power of the Lord came upon Elisha.
2 Kings 3:16 And Elisha declared: 'Thus says the Lord: "Dig many ditches and trenches throughout this dry valley!"'
2 Kings 3:17 For thus says the Lord: 'Even though you will see no wind or rain, this valley will be filled with water, so that you, your families, and your animals can drink.'
2 Kings 3:18 And this miracle alone is but a small thing in the sight of the Lord; He will also deliver Moab, your enemy, into your hands.
2 Kings 3:19 And you will conquer every fortified city and destroy every important town. You will cut down every fruit-bearing tree, stop up every spring of water, and ruin every fertile field by covering it with stones.
2 Kings 3:20 So it came to pass the next morning, at the hour when the daily sacrifice was customarily offered, and behold, water began to flow from the direction of Edom, and the land was quickly filled with water.
2 Kings 3:21 Now all the Moabites, hearing that the allied kings had come up to fight against them, called together every man who was able to bear arms, from the youngest to the oldest, and they took their stand at their borders.
2 Kings 3:22 And they rose early in the morning, and when the sun had fully risen, shining on the water, the Moabites looked and saw the water appearing as red as blood.
2 Kings 3:23 And they exclaimed, 'This is blood! The allied kings must have fought fiercely and slaughtered each other with their swords! Everyone must have slain his neighbor! Now, therefore, Moab, let us go for the plunder!'
2 Kings 3:24 But when the Moabites approached the camp of Israel, the men of Israel suddenly rose up and struck down the Moabites, who then fled in panic before them. As the Israelites pursued and struck down the Moabites, they continued to lay waste to the entire region.
2 Kings 3:25 And the allied armies continued to destroy the cities, filling every fertile field with stones. They stopped up every spring of water and cut down every fruit-bearing tree, leaving only the stone walls of the final stronghold. They surrounded this last remaining city with siege works and relentlessly attacked it with sling stones from above.
2 Kings 3:26 Now when the king of Moab saw that the battle was completely lost to his enemies, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, hoping to break through the lines towards the king of Edom; but they were unable to succeed.
2 Kings 3:27 Then, in a desperate act, he took his eldest son, who was destined to succeed him as king, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the city wall. This act caused great moral indignation among the allied forces, who immediately withdrew from the city and returned to their own land.
2 Kings 4:1 A certain woman, one of the wives of your prophet-disciples, cried out to Elisha, saying: 'My husband, your servant, is dead. And you know that your servant was a man who truly feared the Lord—a devout man. But now, a creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves, to settle their father's debt!'
2 Kings 4:2 Elisha then asked her: 'What do you want me to do for you, my child? Tell me, what do you have in your house?' She replied: 'Your servant has absolutely nothing left in my house, except a tiny bit of oil, just enough for personal anointing.'
2 Kings 4:3 And he said to her: 'Go now, and borrow empty vessels from all your neighbors—and make sure to get many of them, not just a few!'
2 Kings 4:4 Then go inside, and close the door upon yourself and your sons. Begin to pour your existing oil into all these empty vessels. And as each vessel becomes full, set it aside.'
2 Kings 4:5 So the woman went and did as Elisha commanded. She closed the door upon herself and her sons. Her sons began bringing her the empty vessels, and she continued pouring from her small jar.
2 Kings 4:6 When all the vessels were full, she said to her son: 'Bring me another vessel.' But he responded: 'There are no more!' At that very moment, the flow of oil stopped completely.
2 Kings 4:7 So she went and told the man of God what had happened. He said: 'Go, sell the oil, and repay your creditor. You and your sons can then live on the rest of the money.'
2 Kings 4:8 It happened one day that Elisha was passing through Shunem. There was a prominent and wealthy woman there, who urged him to come and eat bread with her. So whenever he passed through, he would turn aside to her house to eat bread.
2 Kings 4:9 She said to her husband: 'I perceive that this is a holy man of God who frequently passes by our house.'
2 Kings 4:10 She continued: 'Let us make a small room on the roof for him, and furnish it with a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp. Then, whenever he comes to us, he can stay there.'
2 Kings 4:11 So it happened one day that when Elisha came, he went to that room and rested there.
2 Kings 4:12 Then he said to Gehazi, his servant: 'Call this Shunammite woman.' When Gehazi called her, and she stood before Elisha,
2 Kings 4:13 Elisha said to Gehazi: 'Speak to her and tell her: “Behold, you have diligently provided for us and shown us every kindness. What do you wish that I do for you in return? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king, or to the commander of the army?”' She replied: 'I dwell among my own people—I lack nothing.'
2 Kings 4:14 And Elisha asked: 'What then can be done for her?' Gehazi replied: 'She has no son, and her husband is an old man.'
2 Kings 4:15 So Elisha commanded that she be called again. When she was called, and stood in the doorway, he said:
2 Kings 4:16 'At this very time, in this same season, in the coming year, you shall embrace a son.' But she exclaimed: 'No, my lord, man of God, do not lie to your handmaid!'
2 Kings 4:17 And indeed, the woman conceived and bore a son at the very time and in the season that Elisha had promised her.
2 Kings 4:18 The boy grew up. And it happened one day that he went out to his father, who was with the reapers in the field,
2 Kings 4:19 and he cried out to his father: 'My head, my head aches! My head, my head aches!' His father then said to one of the servants: 'Carry him home, and take him to his mother.'
2 Kings 4:20 So the servant carried him and brought him to his mother. She held him on her knees until midday, and then he died.
2 Kings 4:21 Then she went up to the room, placed him on the bed of the man of God, closed the door, and left.
2 Kings 4:22 She called her husband, saying: 'Please send me one of the young men and a donkey, so I can hurry to the man of God and return quickly.'
2 Kings 4:23 He asked: 'For what reason are you going to him today? Is it the New Moon festival or the Sabbath day?' She replied, cryptically: 'It is well.' —meaning 'All is fine, I will explain later.'
2 Kings 4:24 So she saddled the donkey and instructed her servant: 'Drive quickly; do not slow down the pace unless I tell you to.'
2 Kings 4:25 Thus she went and arrived at the man of God, Elisha, on Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi: 'Look, it is that Shunammite woman!'
2 Kings 4:26 'Run now to meet her,' he instructed, 'and ask her: “Is all well with you? Is all well with your husband? Is all well with your son?”' She replied, again briefly: 'All is well.'
2 Kings 4:27 But when she reached the man of God on the mountain, she grasped his feet. Gehazi approached to push her away. But the man of God said: 'Leave her alone, for her soul is in bitterness. The Lord has hidden it from me and has not revealed it to me.'
2 Kings 4:28 And she cried out: 'Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say to you: “Do not deceive me”?'
2 Kings 4:29 Elisha then said to Gehazi: 'Gird up your loins, take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone on the way, do not greet them; and if anyone greets you, do not answer them. Place my staff upon the face of the boy.'
2 Kings 4:30 But the mother of the boy declared: 'As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!' So Elisha arose and followed her.
2 Kings 4:31 Meanwhile, Gehazi had gone ahead of them and had placed the staff upon the boy's face. But there was no voice, nor any sign of life. So he returned to meet Elisha and reported to him, saying: 'The boy has not awakened.'
2 Kings 4:32 Then Elisha entered the house, and behold, the boy was lying dead on his own bed.
2 Kings 4:33 He went in and closed the door behind himself and the boy, and he prayed to the Lord.
2 Kings 4:34 Then he went up and lay upon the boy, putting his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands. He stretched himself out upon him, and the boy's flesh began to grow warm.
2 Kings 4:35 Elisha then went down and walked around in the house once more. Then he went up again and stretched himself out upon the boy once more. And the boy sneezed seven times, and then opened his eyes.
2 Kings 4:36 Elisha called Gehazi and told him: 'Call this Shunammite woman.' When she was called, she came in to him. He said: 'Take up your son!'
2 Kings 4:37 She came in, fell at his feet, and prostrated herself on the ground in worship. Then she took up her son and went out.
2 Kings 4:38 Elisha then returned to Gilgal. There was a severe famine in the land, and the prophet-disciples were sitting before him. He said to one of his servants: 'Put a large pot on the fire, and cook a stew for the prophet-disciples.'
2 Kings 4:39 One of them went out into the field to gather herbs. He found a wild plant and gathered enough of its fruit to fill his cloak, —like wild gourds—. He came back and chopped them into the pot of stew, for they did not know what it was.
2 Kings 4:40 So they served it to the men to eat. But when they tasted the stew, they cried out, saying: 'There is death in the pot, O man of God! There is death in the pot!' And they could not eat it.
2 Kings 4:1 A certain woman, one of the wives of the prophets, cried out to Elisha, saying: “Your servant, my husband, is dead. You know that your servant lived in holy fear of the Lord. And now a creditor has come to take my two sons to be his slaves to pay off the debt.”
2 Kings 4:2 And Elisha said to her: “What do you want me to do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?” And she responded: “Your handmaid has nothing in my house, except a small amount of oil.”
2 Kings 4:3 He said: “Go and borrow many empty vessels from all your neighbors. Make sure there are not just a few.”
2 Kings 4:4 Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour the oil into all these vessels. And when they are full, set them aside.”
2 Kings 4:5 So the woman went away and shut the door upon herself and upon her sons. They brought the vessels to her, and she kept pouring.
2 Kings 4:6 And when all the vessels were full, she said to her son: “Bring me still another vessel.” He responded: “There are no more.”
2 Kings 4:7 And at that moment, the oil stopped flowing.
2 Kings 4:8 So she came and told the man of God. He said: “Go, sell the oil, and pay the creditor. You and your sons can then live on the rest of the money.”
2 Kings 4:9 Now it happened that Elisha was passing through Shunem. And there was a wealthy and influential woman there, who urged him to eat bread with her. So whenever he passed by, he would turn aside to her house to eat bread.
2 Kings 4:10 And she said to her husband: “I perceive that this man, who passes by us so frequently, is a holy man of God.”
2 Kings 4:11 “Let us make a small upper room for him and put in it a small bed, and a table, and a chair, and a lamp. So that when he comes to us, he may stay there.”
2 Kings 4:12 So it happened one day that Elisha came, and he turned aside to the upper room and rested there.
2 Kings 4:13 And he said to Gehazi, his servant: “Call this Shunammite woman.” And when he had called her, and she stood before him,
2 Kings 4:14 Elisha said to his servant: “What do you want me to do for her?” Gehazi responded: “Indeed, she has no son, and her husband is old.”
2 Kings 4:15 So he commanded: “Call her.” And when he had called her, she stood in the doorway.
2 Kings 4:16 And he said to her: “At this time next year, you will hold a son in your womb.” But she responded: “No, my lord, man of God, do not deceive your handmaid.”
2 Kings 4:17 So the woman conceived and bore a son at that very time, and at the same hour, as Elisha had said.
2 Kings 4:18 And the boy grew up. And it happened one day that he went out to his father among the reapers in the field.
2 Kings 4:19 He said to his father: “My head hurts, my head hurts!” And his father said to a servant: “Take him and bring him to his mother.”
2 Kings 4:20 And when the servant had taken him and brought him to his mother, the boy sat on her knees until midday, and then he died.
2 Kings 4:21 But she went up and laid him upon the bed of the man of God, shut the door, and went out.
2 Kings 4:22 And she called her husband, saying: “Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so that I may quickly go to the man of God and return.”
2 Kings 4:23 He said: “For what reason are you going to him? It is not the new moon, nor the Sabbath.” These were the customary times people visited prophets. She responded: “It is well.”
2 Kings 4:24 So she saddled the donkey and sat upon it. And she said to her servant: “Drive fast and hurry. Do not speak to me unless I tell you.”
2 Kings 4:25 So she went, and came to the man of God on Mount Carmel. And when the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to Gehazi, his servant: “Behold, there is that Shunammite woman!”
2 Kings 4:26 “Go to meet her and ask: ‘Is all well? Is your husband well? Is your son well?’” And she responded: “All is well.”
2 Kings 4:27 But when she came to the man of God on the mountain, she took hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said: “Leave her alone, for her soul is in bitterness. The Lord has hidden it from me and has not revealed it to me.”
2 Kings 4:28 And she said: “Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say to you: ‘Do not deceive me?’”
2 Kings 4:29 And Elisha said to Gehazi: “Gird up your loins and prepare for urgent travel. Take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him. And if anyone greets you, do not answer him. Lay my staff upon the face of the boy.”
2 Kings 4:30 And the mother of the boy said: “As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So he arose and went with her.
2 Kings 4:31 But Gehazi had gone ahead of them and had laid the staff upon the face of the boy. And there was no voice, nor any sign of life. So he returned and met Elisha, and announced to him, saying: “The boy has not awoken.”
2 Kings 4:32 So Elisha went into the upper room, and behold, the dead boy lay upon his own bed.
2 Kings 4:33 And having entered, he shut the door upon himself and upon the boy, and prayed to the Lord.
2 Kings 4:34 Then he went up and lay upon the boy. He put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands. And he stretched himself upon him, and the flesh of the boy grew warm.
2 Kings 4:35 And he turned away and walked through the house once within, and then went up again. He stretched himself upon him, and the boy sneezed seven times, and then opened his eyes.
2 Kings 4:36 And he called Gehazi, and said to him: “Call this Shunammite woman.” And when he had called her, and she had come in to him, Elisha said: “Take your son.”
2 Kings 4:37 She came, and fell at his feet, and bowed deeply in reverence towards the ground. Then she took her son and went out.
2 Kings 4:38 Now Elisha returned to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land, and the community of prophets were sitting before him. And he said to one of his servants: “Put on the large pot and cook stew for the community of prophets.”
2 Kings 4:39 But one went out into the field to gather wild herbs. He found something like a wild vine and gathered wild gourds from it, filling his cloak. And when he returned, he cut them into the pot of stew, for they did not know what it was. These gourds were poisonous.
2 Kings 4:40 And they poured it out for their companions to eat. But when they had eaten of that stew, they cried out, saying: “Death is in the pot, O man of God!” And they could not eat it.
2 Kings 4:1 A certain woman, one of the wives of the prophets, cried out to Elisha, saying, "Your servant, my husband, has died, and you know that your servant truly feared the Lord. Now, look, a creditor has come to take my two sons as slaves for himself to settle the debt."
2 Kings 4:2 Then Elisha said to her, "What do you want me to do for you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?" She answered, "Your maidservant has nothing at all in the house, except a single small jar of oil."
2 Kings 4:3 He said, "Go now and borrow empty vessels from all your neighbors. Make sure there are not just a few of them, but many."
2 Kings 4:4 Then, go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour the oil from your jar into all these borrowed vessels. When they are full, set them aside."
2 Kings 4:5 So the woman went away and shut the door behind herself and her sons. They brought her the vessels, and she continued to pour the oil.
2 Kings 4:6 When all the vessels were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel." He responded, "There isn't another vessel left." And then the oil stopped flowing.
2 Kings 4:7 Then she went and told the man of God what had happened. He said, "Go now, sell the oil, and pay your creditor. After that, you and your sons can live on the rest of the money."
2 Kings 4:8 It came to pass one day that Elisha was passing through Shunem. There was a prominent woman there who urged him to eat bread. And whenever he passed by frequently, he would turn aside to her house to eat bread.
2 Kings 4:9 She said to her husband, "Look, I perceive that this man who passes by us so often is a holy man of God."
2 Kings 4:10 "Let us make a small room for him on the roof, and put a bed in it for him, and a table, and a chair, and a lampstand. Then, whenever he comes to us, he can stay there."
2 Kings 4:11 So it came to pass one day that Elisha came, turned aside to the room on the roof, and rested there.
2 Kings 4:12 He said to Gehazi, his servant, "Call this Shunammite woman." When Gehazi had called her, and she stood before Elisha,
2 Kings 4:13 Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tell her: 'Behold, you have gone to great trouble for us with all your hospitality. What do you want me to do for you in return? Do you have any request you want me to speak to the king about, or to the commander of the army?'" She responded, "I live among my own people; I am content with my position in life and have no need of royal connections."
2 Kings 4:14 Elisha then said, "What then can be done for her?" And Gehazi answered, "She has no son, and her husband is old."
2 Kings 4:15 So he commanded that she be called. When she had been called and stood in the doorway, Elisha said,
2 Kings 4:16 "At this same time next year, when life returns in its cycle, you will be holding a son in your arms." But she responded, "No, my lord, man of God, do not lie to your maidservant about such a hope."
2 Kings 4:17 And indeed, the woman conceived and gave birth to a son at that very time, at the exact hour Elisha had told her.
2 Kings 4:18 So the boy grew up. And it happened one day that he went out to his father among the reapers in the field.
2 Kings 4:19 He said to his father, "My head hurts, my head hurts!" So his father said to a servant, "Carry him and take him to his mother."
2 Kings 4:20 When the servant had carried him and brought him to his mother, she laid him on her lap until noon, and then he died.
2 Kings 4:21 But she went up to the room on the roof and laid him on the bed of the man of God. Then she shut the door and went out.
2 Kings 4:22 She called her husband, saying, "Send me one of the young men and a donkey, so I can ride quickly to the man of God and return."
2 Kings 4:23 Her husband said to her, "Why are you going to him today? It is not the New Moon festival, nor is it the Sabbath day, when people typically seek out prophets." She responded, "All is well," keeping her son's death a secret.
2 Kings 4:24 So she saddled the donkey and instructed her servant, "Drive steadily and hurry. Do not stop speaking to me on the way unless I tell you to."
2 Kings 4:25 So she set out and came to the man of God on Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her coming from a distance, he said to Gehazi, his servant, "Look, there is that Shunammite woman."
2 Kings 4:26 "Therefore, go meet her and ask: 'Are you well? Is your husband well? Is the boy well?'" She responded, "All is well."
2 Kings 4:27 When she came to the man of God on the mountain, she grasped his feet. And Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, "Leave her alone, for her soul is in bitterness and anguish, and the Lord has hidden it from me and not revealed it to me."
2 Kings 4:28 And she said, "Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say to you, 'Do not deceive me with false hope' (by promising a son)?"
2 Kings 4:29 Then Elisha said to Gehazi, "Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand. Go quickly! If you meet anyone on the way, do not greet them with conversation, and if anyone greets you, do not answer them. Then, place my staff on the boy's face."
2 Kings 4:30 But the boy's mother said, "As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you and go without you." So Elisha rose and went with her.
2 Kings 4:31 Meanwhile, Gehazi had gone ahead of them and had placed the staff on the boy's face. But there was no voice, and no sign of life or consciousness. So he returned to meet Elisha and reported to him, saying, "The boy has not awakened."
2 Kings 4:32 Then Elisha entered the room on the roof, and behold, the dead boy was lying on his bed.
2 Kings 4:33 So he went out, closed the door behind him, and prayed to the Lord.
2 Kings 4:34 Then he went up onto the bed and lay stretched out over the boy. He put his mouth on the boy's mouth, his eyes on the boy's eyes, and his hands on the boy's hands. As he remained bowed over the boy, the boy's flesh grew warm.
2 Kings 4:35 Then Elisha returned and walked around the house once or twice. After that, he went up again and stretched out over him. The boy then sneezed seven times, and he opened his eyes.
2 Kings 4:36 Elisha called Gehazi and said to him, "Call that Shunammite woman." So she was called and came in to him. Elisha said, "Take up your son."
2 Kings 4:37 She came, fell at his feet, and prostrated herself on the ground in worship and profound gratitude. Then she took up her son and went out.
2 Kings 4:38 Elisha returned to Gilgal, as there was a severe famine in the land. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him for instruction. He said to one of his servants, "Put a large pot on, and boil some stew for the sons of the prophets."
2 Kings 4:39 Then one of them went out into the field to gather herbs. He found a wild plant and gathered from it wild gourds, filling his cloak. He returned and cut them into the pot of stew, without anyone knowing what they were.
2 Kings 4:40 When the stew was poured out for the men to eat, as they ate, they cried out, saying, "There is death in the pot, O man of God!" And they could not eat it.
2 Kings 5:1 Naaman, the commander of the Syrian army, was a very rich, noble, and powerful man. However, he was a leper.
2 Kings 5:2 Syrian raiders had previously gone out into Israel, and they had captured a young girl. This girl was now serving Naaman’s wife.
2 Kings 5:3 The young girl said to her mistress, “If only my master Naaman would go to the prophet who lives in Samaria, he would certainly be cured of his leprosy.”
2 Kings 5:4 Naaman then went to his king and reported what the girl from the land of Israel had said.
2 Kings 5:5 The king of Syria told Naaman, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and six changes of fine clothing as gifts.
2 Kings 5:6 He brought the letter to the king of Israel. The letter read: “When you receive this letter, know that I have sent my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”
2 Kings 5:7 When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and exclaimed, “Am I God, able to kill and to give life, that this man sends someone to me to be cured of leprosy? This is obviously a pretext; he is looking for a reason to attack me.”
2 Kings 5:8 However, when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, saying: “Why have you torn your clothes? Let Naaman come to me, and he will know that there is a true prophet in Israel.”
2 Kings 5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the entrance of Elisha’s house.
2 Kings 5:10 Elisha sent a messenger out to Naaman, telling him, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan River. Your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”
2 Kings 5:11 Naaman departed in anger, saying, “I thought he would come out to me personally, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place of my leprosy, and cure me.”
2 Kings 5:12 He continued, “Are not the rivers of Damascus, Abana and Pharphar, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” He then turned and went away in a rage.
2 Kings 5:13 His servants approached him and reasoned with him, saying, “Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some difficult thing, you would certainly have done it. How much more, then, when he simply tells you: ‘Wash, and you will be clean’?”
2 Kings 5:14 So Naaman went down and washed himself seven times in the Jordan, just as the man of God had instructed. His flesh was restored, becoming like the flesh of a young child, and he was completely clean.
2 Kings 5:15 Then Naaman returned to the man of God with all his company. He came and stood before Elisha and declared, “Now I truly know that there is no other God in all the earth except in Israel. Therefore, I beg you, please accept a gift from your servant.”
2 Kings 5:16 Elisha replied, “As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will accept nothing from you.” Naaman urged him, but Elisha refused.
2 Kings 5:17 Then Naaman said, “If you will not accept a gift, then please, let me, your servant, be given two mule-loads of this Israelite earth. For from now on, your servant will no longer offer burnt offerings or sacrifices to foreign gods, but only to the Lord.”
2 Kings 5:18 Naaman continued, “But in this one thing, I ask the Lord to forgive your servant: when my king enters the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon along with him, may the Lord forgive me, your servant, for this act of bowing.”
2 Kings 5:19 Elisha said to him, “Go in peace.” So Naaman departed from him, and had traveled only a short distance.
2 Kings 5:20 Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, “Look, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, by not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will surely run after him and get something from him!”
2 Kings 5:21 So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he quickly dismounted from his chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?”
2 Kings 5:22 Gehazi replied, “Yes, everything is well. My master sent me, saying, ‘Look, two young men, members of the prophets’ community, have just arrived from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’”
2 Kings 5:23 Naaman said, “By all means, take two talents!” He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up two talents of silver in two bags, along with two changes of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi.
2 Kings 5:24 When Gehazi reached the hill, he took the gifts from their hands and put them away in the house. Then he sent the men away, and they departed.
2 Kings 5:25 He then went in and stood before his master. Elisha asked him, “Where have you come from, Gehazi?” He answered, “Your servant has not been anywhere.”
2 Kings 5:26 But Elisha replied, “Was not my spirit present when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to accept money, and to accept clothes, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and male and female servants?” This rhetorical question from Elisha implies that it was a time of spiritual significance, not personal gain.
2 Kings 5:27 Elisha concluded, “Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your descendants forever.” And immediately, Gehazi departed from Elisha, a leper, white as snow.
2 Kings 5:1 Naaman was the commander of the Syrian king’s army. He was a great man and highly esteemed by his master, because the Lord had granted the Syrians victory through him. He was also a powerful and wealthy man, but he was suffering from leprosy.
2 Kings 5:2 Now some raiders had gone out from the land of Syria, and they had taken captive a young girl from the land of Israel, who now served Naaman’s wife.
2 Kings 5:3 She said to her mistress, 'If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would certainly cure him of the leprosy he has.'
2 Kings 5:4 So Naaman went in and told his master, saying, 'The girl from the land of Israel said these things.'
2 Kings 5:5 And the king of Syria said to him, 'Go, and I will send letters to the king of Israel.' When Naaman departed, he took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and six changes of garments.
2 Kings 5:6 And he brought the letters to the king of Israel, saying, 'When you receive this letter, know that I have sent my servant Naaman to you, so that you may cure him of his leprosy.'
2 Kings 5:7 When the king of Israel read the letters, he tore his clothes in grief and alarm, and said, 'Am I God, that I can kill and make alive, that this man sends to me to cure a person of his leprosy? Observe and see that he is seeking an opportunity for conflict against me.'
2 Kings 5:8 When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, saying, 'Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel, a man of God who can intercede.'
2 Kings 5:9 So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and he stopped at the door of Elisha’s house.
2 Kings 5:10 And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, 'Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan River, and your flesh will be restored to health, and you will be clean from your leprosy.'
2 Kings 5:11 Naaman departed in anger, saying, 'I thought that he would surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place of the leprosy, and cure me.'
2 Kings 5:12 'Are not the rivers of Damascus, Abana and Pharpar, better than all the waters of Israel, that I might wash in them and be clean?' And when he had turned away and was going off in indignation, his servants approached him.
2 Kings 5:13 His servants approached him and spoke to him, saying, 'My father, even if the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would surely have done it. How much more now that he has said to you, ‘Wash, and you will be clean’?'
2 Kings 5:14 So he went down and washed seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was made clean.
2 Kings 5:15 And he returned to the man of God with all his company. He came and stood before him, and said, 'Now I truly know that there is no other God in all the earth, except only in Israel. Therefore, I beg you to accept a gift from your servant.'
2 Kings 5:16 Elisha answered, 'As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.' And though Naaman urged him, he refused to take the gift.
2 Kings 5:17 Naaman then said, 'If you will not accept a gift, then please, let two mule-loads of earth be given to your servant. For your servant will no longer offer burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord, the one true God.'
2 Kings 5:18 But for this one thing alone I pray to the Lord, that when my king enters the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I bow myself in the temple of Rimmon while he worships in that place — may the Lord forgive your servant for this action, understanding that it is out of duty to my king, not true worship of an idol.
2 Kings 5:19 And Elisha said to him, 'Go in peace.' So Naaman had traveled only a short distance from him.
2 Kings 5:20 But Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, said, 'Behold, my master has let this Naaman, this Syrian, depart without accepting from him what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will run after him and take something from him!'
2 Kings 5:21 So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he dismounted from his chariot to meet him, and said, 'Is everything well?'
2 Kings 5:22 And Gehazi said, 'All is well. My master sent me, saying: Behold, just now two young men from the hill country of Ephraim, from the sons of the prophets, have come to me. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.'
2 Kings 5:23 Naaman said, 'No, rather take two talents of silver!' And he urged him to take it. Then Naaman tied up two talents of silver in two bags, along with two changes of garments, and put them on two of his servants, who then carried them ahead of Gehazi.
2 Kings 5:24 When Gehazi arrived at the hill, he took the gifts from their hands and stored them in his house. Then he sent the men away, and they departed.
2 Kings 5:25 And he went in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, 'From where have you come, Gehazi?' He answered, 'Your servant went nowhere.' He was attempting to deceive his master.
2 Kings 5:26 But Elisha said, 'Was not my spirit present when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time now to receive money, and to receive garments, and to buy olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and male servants, and female servants?'
2 Kings 5:27 'Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your descendants forever.' And Gehazi went out from his presence, a leper, as white as snow.
2 Kings 6:1 And the disciples of the prophets spoke to Elisha, saying, "Look, this place where we are living with you is too small for all of us."
2 Kings 6:2 They continued, "Let's go down to the Jordan River, and each of us can cut down a tree trunk or log so we can build a larger dwelling place for ourselves there."
2 Kings 6:3 And Elisha responded, "Go ahead."
2 Kings 6:4 Then one of the prophets' disciples said to Elisha, "Please come with us, your servants."
2 Kings 6:5 Elisha replied, "I will come with you." So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they began cutting down trees and logs.
2 Kings 6:6 As one of them was cutting down a log, the iron axe-head flew off the handle and sank into the water. He cried out in dismay, "Oh no, my master! And I borrowed this axe!"
2 Kings 6:7 The man of God, Elisha, asked, "Where did it fall?" The disciple showed him the exact spot. So Elisha cut off a small piece of wood, threw it into the water at that spot, and the iron axe-head immediately floated to the surface.
2 Kings 6:8 At that time, the King of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted with his military commanders, saying, "I will set up an ambush at this particular place."
2 Kings 6:9 But the man of God, Elisha, sent a message to the King of Israel, warning him, "Be careful not to pass through that specific location, because the Syrian army has set an ambush there."
2 Kings 6:10 So the King of Israel sent a scouting party to the place Elisha had warned him about and had already given him a heads-up. Because he took precautions, he and his army were saved from danger, not just once or twice, but many times.
2 Kings 6:11 The King of Syria became greatly disturbed by these repeated failures. He called his military commanders together and demanded, "Why aren't you telling me which one of you is betraying us to the King of Israel?"
2 Kings 6:12 One of his commanders answered, "It's not that at all, my Lord King. It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel, who reveals to the King of Israel every single word you speak, even those uttered in the privacy of your innermost chamber!"
2 Kings 6:13 The King of Syria commanded, "Go and find out where he is, so I can send men to capture him!" His scouts reported back to him, saying, "He is in the city of Dothan."
2 Kings 6:14 So the King of Syria dispatched a large army there, with horses and chariots, a truly powerful force. They marched all night and arrived at Dothan before dawn, completely surrounding the city.
2 Kings 6:15 When Elisha's personal servant woke up early and went outside, he saw a vast army, with horses and chariots, completely surrounding Dothan. He rushed back to Elisha and cried out, "Oh no, my master! What are we going to do?"
2 Kings 6:16 But Elisha replied, "Do not be afraid; for there are more with us than there are with them!"
2 Kings 6:17 Then Elisha prayed, "O Lord, open his eyes so that he may see!" And the Lord immediately opened the servant's eyes, and he looked up and saw, and there, on the mountains surrounding Elisha, was a magnificent sight: the mountain was completely full of horses and chariots made of fire, encircling Elisha.
2 Kings 6:18 As the Syrian soldiers came down the mountain toward Elisha, Elisha prayed to the Lord, "Please strike these people with blindness!" And the Lord struck them with complete blindness, just as Elisha had prayed.
2 Kings 6:19 Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the right road, and this isn't the city you're looking for. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are searching for." So Elisha led them, still blind, all the way to Samaria—the capital city of Israel.
2 Kings 6:20 Once they had entered Samaria, Elisha prayed, "O Lord, open the eyes of these men so they may see!" And the Lord opened their eyes, and they could see again. And they realized with shock that they were right in the middle of Samaria, surrounded by their enemies.
2 Kings 6:21 When the King of Israel saw the Syrian army suddenly appear in the heart of his capital city, he asked Elisha, "Shall I kill them, my father?"
2 Kings 6:22 Elisha answered, "No, do not kill them! Would you normally kill captives you have taken with your own sword and bow? Instead, give them food and water, so they can eat and drink, and then send them back to their master, the King of Syria."
2 Kings 6:23 So the King of Israel prepared a magnificent feast for the Syrian soldiers. They ate and drank, and then he sent them away, and they returned to their master. After this event, the Syrian raiding parties stopped invading the land of Israel for a significant time.
2 Kings 6:24 However, sometime later, after these events, Ben-Hadad, the King of Syria, gathered his entire army, marched to Samaria, and laid siege to the city.
2 Kings 6:25 A terrible famine gripped Samaria during the siege. The siege lasted so long that a donkey's head, normally considered unclean food, was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and even a quarter-kab of dove's droppings, a truly repulsive and desperate measure, was sold for five pieces of silver.
2 Kings 6:26 As the King of Israel was walking along the city wall to inspect the defenses, a woman cried out to him desperately, "Help me, my Lord King!"
2 Kings 6:27 The king replied, "If the Lord won't help you, how can I possibly help you? Do I have grain from the threshing floor, or wine from the winepress to give you?"
2 Kings 6:28 Then the king asked her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "This woman here said to me: 'Give up your son, so we can eat him today,' and then tomorrow we will eat my son."
2 Kings 6:29 So we cooked my son, and we ate him. But the next day, when I told her, 'Now it's your turn, give us your son so we can eat him!' she hid her son.
2 Kings 6:30 When the king heard the woman's story, he tore his clothes in a powerful display of grief and repentance. As he continued along the wall, all the people saw that beneath his royal robes, he was wearing sackcloth against his skin—a sign of deep mourning and humility before God.
2 Kings 6:31 He then swore an oath, saying, "May God punish me severely and even more if I allow Elisha, the son of Shaphat, to live through this day!"
2 Kings 6:32 Elisha was sitting in his house at the time, and the elders of Israel were sitting with him. The King of Israel had sent an executioner to behead Elisha. But before the king's messenger arrived, Elisha, knowing by divine revelation, said to the elders, "Do you see how this son of a murderer—referring to the king—has sent someone to cut off my head? When he arrives, make sure the door is shut and hold him back with the doors! For listen, the sound of his master's footsteps—the king himself—is right behind him!"
2 Kings 6:33 While Elisha was still speaking, the king's messenger arrived at the door. And immediately after him, the king himself ascended and began to speak, saying, "This terrible evil—this famine—comes directly from the Lord! Why should I continue to hope or wait for any help from the Lord?"
2 Kings 6:1 Then the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, "Look, this place where we gather and stay with you is now too small for us."
2 Kings 6:2 So let's go down to the Jordan River, and each of us will cut down a log there. Then we can build ourselves a larger place to live in. Elisha replied, "Go ahead."
2 Kings 6:3 But one of them said, "Please, come with your servants." He answered, "I will come."
2 Kings 6:4 So he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they began to cut down trees.
2 Kings 6:5 But as one of them was cutting down a log, the iron head of his axe fell into the water. He cried out, "Oh no, my master! And it was borrowed!"
2 Kings 6:6 The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" He showed him the place. So Elisha cut off a piece of wood and threw it into the water at that spot, and the axe head floated to the surface.
2 Kings 6:7 Elisha said, "Pick it up." The man reached out his hand and took it.
2 Kings 6:8 Now the King of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted with his officers, saying, "I will set up an ambush at such and such a place."
2 Kings 6:9 But the man of God — Elisha — sent a message to the King of Israel, saying, "Be careful not to pass through that specific place, because the Syrians are hiding there in ambush."
2 Kings 6:10 So the King of Israel sent a warning to the place which the man of God had told him about and had forewarned him against. The king saved his army there not just once or twice.
2 Kings 6:11 The King of Syria's heart was greatly troubled by this, so he called his officers together and asked them, "Why don't you tell me which of us is betraying us to the King of Israel?"
2 Kings 6:12 One of his officers replied, "By no means, my lord and king. It is Elisha the prophet, who is in Israel, who tells the King of Israel all the words you speak even in your secret bedchamber."
2 Kings 6:13 The king said to them, "Go and find out where he is, so I can send men to capture him." They reported to him, saying, "Look, he is in Dothan."
2 Kings 6:14 So the king sent horses and chariots and a great army there. They arrived at night and surrounded the city.
2 Kings 6:15 When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, he saw an army surrounding the city with horses and chariots. The servant said to him, "Oh no, my master! What shall we do?"
2 Kings 6:16 But Elisha said, "Do not be afraid. For there are more with us than there are with them."
2 Kings 6:17 Then Elisha prayed and said, "Lord, open this young man's eyes so he may see." And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw! Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
2 Kings 6:18 When the Syrians came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, saying, "Strike this nation with blindness, I beg You." And the Lord struck them with blindness, just as Elisha had requested.
2 Kings 6:19 Then Elisha said to them, "This is not the right road, nor is this the city you're looking for. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you seek." So he led them into Samaria, the capital of Israel.
2 Kings 6:20 When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, "Lord, open the eyes of these men so they may see." And the Lord opened their eyes, and they looked around. Behold, they realized they were in the middle of Samaria!
2 Kings 6:21 When the King of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, "My father, shall I strike them down? Shall I strike them down?"
2 Kings 6:22 Elisha answered, "You must not strike them down. Do you strike down even those you have taken captive with your sword and bow? Set food and water before them, so they may eat and drink, and then return to their master, the King of Syria."
2 Kings 6:23 So the King of Israel prepared a great feast for them. After they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away. They returned to their master, and the raiding parties of the Syrians did not come into the land of Israel again.
2 Kings 6:24 However, after this, Ben-Hadad, the King of Syria, gathered his entire army, marched up, and besieged Samaria.
2 Kings 6:25 There was a great famine in Samaria. The city was under such a long siege that a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a quarter of a cab (a small measure) of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. People were desperate for any food.
2 Kings 6:26 As the King of Israel was walking along the city wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, "Help me, my lord and king!"
2 Kings 6:27 He replied, "If the Lord does not save you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor, or from the winepress? I have no food to give."
2 Kings 6:28 Then the king asked her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son so we can eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'"
2 Kings 6:29 So we cooked my son and ate him. Then I said to her the next day, 'Give up your son so we can eat him.' But she hid her son away.
2 Kings 6:30 When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his clothes. As he walked along the wall, all the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth underneath, against his skin.
2 Kings 6:31 Then the king said, "May God do so to me, and even more, if the head of Elisha, the son of Shaphat, remains on his shoulders this very day!"
2 Kings 6:32 Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king had sent a messenger to behead Elisha. But before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Do you see that this son of a murderer has sent someone to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it fast against him with the door bar. For indeed, the sound of his master's footsteps is right behind him!"
2 Kings 6:33 While Elisha was still speaking with them, the messenger appeared. And the messenger said, "Look, this disaster is from the Lord! Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?"
2 Kings 6:1 The sons of the prophets—that is, the disciples under Elisha's guidance—told Elisha: "Look, the place where we are staying with you is too small for us."
2 Kings 6:2 "Let's go all the way to the Jordan River, and each of us will take a single log from the trees there, so we can build ourselves a new dwelling place." Elisha replied: "Go ahead."
2 Kings 6:3 Then one of them said, "Please, come with your servants as well." He answered: "I will come."
2 Kings 6:4 So he went with them. And when they arrived at the Jordan River, they began to cut down trees.
2 Kings 6:5 It happened that as one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axe-head fell into the water. He cried out in distress and said: "Oh no, my master! And I even borrowed this axe-head."
2 Kings 6:6 And the man of God—that is, Elisha—asked: "Where did it fall?" The man showed him the spot. So Elisha cut off a piece of wood and threw it toward that place, and the axe-head floated to the surface.
2 Kings 6:7 And Elisha said: "Pick it up." So he reached out his hand and took it.
2 Kings 6:8 Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel, and after taking counsel with his servants, he said: "In such and such a place I will set an ambush."
2 Kings 6:9 Therefore, the man of God—Elisha—sent word to the king of Israel, saying: "Be careful not to pass through that specific place, because the Syrians are lying in ambush there."
2 Kings 6:10 And the king of Israel sent men to the place that the man of God had told him about and had warned him of. And the king of Israel took precautions there, not just once or twice.
2 Kings 6:11 The heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this matter. He called his servants together and said: "Why don't you tell me who among us is a traitor to the king of Israel?"
2 Kings 6:12 And one of his servants said: "By no means, my lord king. It is not a traitor among us, but rather Elisha the prophet, who is in Israel, who tells the king of Israel all the words that you speak even in your private bedchamber."
2 Kings 6:13 So the king said: "Go and see where he is, so that I may send and capture him." And it was reported to him by those who said: "Look, he is in Dothan."
2 Kings 6:14 Therefore, he sent horses and chariots and a strong army there. When they arrived by night, they surrounded the city.
2 Kings 6:15 So at dawn, the servant of the man of God arose and went out, and he saw the army encircling the city, with horses and chariots. And he reported to Elisha, saying: "Oh no, my master, what shall we do?"
2 Kings 6:16 But Elisha answered: "Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more numerous than those who are with them."
2 Kings 6:17 And Elisha prayed and said: "Lord, open this young man's eyes so that he may see." And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
2 Kings 6:18 Now as the Syrians came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, saying: "Please, strike this people with blindness." And the Lord struck them with blindness, according to Elisha's word.
2 Kings 6:19 And Elisha said to them: "This is not the way, nor is this the city you're looking for. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are seeking." So he led them to Samaria.
2 Kings 6:20 And when they had entered Samaria, Elisha said: "Lord, open the eyes of these men so that they may see." And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw, and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria—the capital city of Israel, deep within enemy territory.
2 Kings 6:21 And the king of Israel, seeing them, said to Elisha: "Should I strike them down, my father?"
2 Kings 6:22 Elisha replied: "You shall not strike them down. For you would not strike down even those you captured with your sword and your bow in battle. Instead, set bread and water before them, so that they may eat and drink, and then return to their master."
2 Kings 6:23 So the king prepared a great meal for them. And they ate and drank, and he sent them away, and they returned to their master. And the raiding parties of Syria did not come into the land of Israel any more.
2 Kings 6:24 But it came to pass after these events that Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his army, and marched up and besieged Samaria.
2 Kings 6:25 And there was a great famine in Samaria. And it was besieged for so long that an ass's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver—an exorbitant price for an unclean animal—and a quarter of a measure of dove's dung was sold for five pieces of silver—a sign of extreme desperation.
2 Kings 6:26 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying: "Help me, my lord king!"
2 Kings 6:27 And he said: "May the Lord help you! How can I help you? Is it from the threshing floor or from the winepress?"—implying he had no provisions from either.
2 Kings 6:28 And the king asked her: "What is your trouble?" And she replied: "This woman said to me: 'Give your son, so that we may eat him today, and then tomorrow we will eat my son.'"
2 Kings 6:29 "So we cooked my son and ate him. And the next day, I said to her: 'Give your son, so that we may eat him.' But she hid him."
2 Kings 6:30 When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his garments, and as he walked along the wall, all the people saw that he was wearing sackcloth underneath, next to his skin, as a sign of mourning and repentance.
2 Kings 6:31 And he said: "May God do to me and add to it more punishment, if the head of Elisha, the son of Shaphat, remains on him this day!"—meaning he swore to execute Elisha.
2 Kings 6:32 Elisha, however, was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. So the king sent a man from his presence. But before the messenger could arrive, Elisha said to the elders: "Do you see that this son of a murderer—meaning the king—has sent someone to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold him back with it. For behold, the sound of his master's feet is right behind him."
2 Kings 6:33 While he was still speaking—Elisha, that is—the messenger who was coming to him appeared. And the messenger said: "Behold, such great evil has come from the Lord! Why should I wait any longer for the Lord's help?"

2 Kings 7:1 Then Elisha, the prophet, said: 'Listen now to the word of the Lord! This is what the Lord says: Tomorrow, at this same time of day, within the gates of Samaria, the famine will be over. Then, two measures of fine flour will be sold for just one silver coin, and four measures of barley will be sold for one silver coin.'
2 Kings 7:2 But the royal officer, upon whose arm the king leaned (indicating his high trust and authority), answered the man of God, saying: 'Even if the Lord were to open floodgates in the sky and make food rain down, could this possibly happen?' And Elisha, the prophet, replied: 'You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not partake in the abundance that follows.'
2 Kings 7:3 Now there were four men afflicted with leprosy near the entrance of the city gate. They said to one another, 'Why are we sitting here until we die?'
2 Kings 7:4 If we decide to go into the city, we will die there from starvation. If we remain here, we will also die. So come, let us desert and go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare our lives, we will live. But if they kill us, then we will simply die.
2 Kings 7:5 So they rose up in the evening to go to the camp of the Syrians. But when they came to the edge of the camp, they found no one there.
2 Kings 7:6 For the Lord had caused the Syrian army in the camp to hear the sound of chariots and of horses, and the sound of a very large army approaching. And they had said to one another: 'Look! The king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us and come against us.'
2 Kings 7:7 Therefore, rising up, they fled in silence, abandoning their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and the entire camp, exactly as it was. They simply fled for their lives.
2 Kings 7:8 So when those lepers came to the edge of the camp, they entered one tent, and they ate and drank. They took from there silver, gold, and clothing, and they went away and hid them. Then they returned to another tent, and from there they took more things and hid them too.
2 Kings 7:9 Then they said to one another: 'What we are doing is not right. This is a day of good news, and if we remain silent and do not report it until morning, we will be found guilty of a terrible crime. Come, let us go and report it in the king's palace.'
2 Kings 7:10 So when they arrived at the city gate, they called out, saying: 'We came to the camp of the Syrians, and we found no one there! There was no sound of people, but only horses and donkeys tied up, and the tents just as they were left.'
2 Kings 7:11 Therefore, they reported it to the gatekeepers of the city, who immediately announced it in the king's palace.
2 Kings 7:12 Then the king rose up in the night and said to his servants: 'I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are suffering from famine, and that is why they have left their camp and hidden themselves in the fields, thinking: When the people come out of the city looking for food, we will capture them alive, and then we will enter the city ourselves.'
2 Kings 7:13 One of his servants answered him: 'Let us take five of the remaining horses in the city. Indeed, the entire multitude of Israel that remains here is already like those who have perished (meaning, they are near death from starvation). Let us send them out, and see what is happening.'
2 Kings 7:14 So they sent two horses and chariots (presumably carrying men), and they went out after them, saying: 'Go and see!'
2 Kings 7:15 They followed the Syrians all the way to the Jordan River. And behold, the entire road was full of clothing and equipment, which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste to flee. And returning, they reported it to the king.
2 Kings 7:16 Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. And just as the Lord had declared, two measures of fine flour were sold for one silver coin, and four measures of barley were sold for one silver coin.
2 Kings 7:17 Now the king had appointed that very royal officer (who was his close advisor) to be in charge of the gate. But the crowd trampled him in the gateway as they rushed out, and he died, just as the man of God had prophesied when the king came to him (earlier, during the famine).
2 Kings 7:18 For it happened exactly according to the word of the man of God, who had said to the king: 'Two measures of fine flour will be sold for one silver coin, and four measures of barley will be sold for one silver coin, by this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria.'
2 Kings 7:19 When that officer had also responded to the man of God, saying: 'Even if the Lord were to open floodgates in the sky, could this possibly happen?' And Elisha had said to him: 'You will indeed see it with your own eyes, but you will not partake in that abundance.'
2 Kings 7:20 And it happened to him just as Elisha had foretold: for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died there.
2 Kings 7:1 It happened that the king was dwelling securely in his own house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies,
2 Kings 7:2 he then said to Nathan the prophet: “Look, I am living in a house built with cedar wood, but the Ark of God, which represents the Lord's presence, is placed only inside curtains.”
2 Kings 7:3 And Nathan said to the king: “Go and do everything that is in your heart, for the Lord is with you in this endeavor.”
2 Kings 7:4 However, it happened that in that very night, behold, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:
2 Kings 7:5 “Go and speak to My servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord: Are you the one who will build a house for Me to dwell in?’”
2 Kings 7:6 “For I have not lived in a permanent house from the day I brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this very day; instead, I have moved about in a tabernacle, which is a portable sanctuary, and in a tent.”
2 Kings 7:7 “In all the places through which I have passed with all the children of Israel, did I ever speak a word to any one of the tribes of Israel, to whom I commanded to feed My people Israel, saying: ‘Why have you not built Me a cedar house?’”
2 Kings 7:8 “And now, you shall say this to My servant David: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you from the pastures, from following the flock, so that you would be a leader over My people Israel.’”
2 Kings 7:9 “And I have been with you in all places wherever you have walked, and I have destroyed all your enemies from before you; and I have made for you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.”
2 Kings 7:10 “And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and I will plant them there, and they will live securely under their own rule, and they will not be disturbed any longer; nor will the sons of wickedness oppress them again, as they did at the first,”
2 Kings 7:11 “from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies. Furthermore, the Lord proclaims to you that He Himself will make a house for you—a dynasty and a lasting lineage.”
2 Kings 7:12 “And when your days are completed, and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom firmly.”
2 Kings 7:13 “He himself will build a house for My name, a temple of worship, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.”
2 Kings 7:14 “I will be to him a father, and he himself will be to Me a son. If he does anything wickedly, I will discipline him with the rod of men, and with the scourges of the sons of men, as a father would correct his child.”
2 Kings 7:15 “But My mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from My presence.”
2 Kings 7:16 “And your house shall be faithful, and your kingdom shall endure forever before you; and your throne shall be firm perpetually.”
2 Kings 7:17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
2 Kings 7:18 Then King David entered and sat before the Lord, and he said: “Who am I, Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me to this point of favor?”
2 Kings 7:19 “But even this is a small thing in Your sight, Lord God, unless You have also spoken concerning the house of Your servant for a long time to come; this is the law and decree of man, Lord God, that such a promise would be made.”
2 Kings 7:20 “Therefore, what more can David add by speaking to You? For You know Your servant, Lord God, and all his thoughts.”
2 Kings 7:21 “Because of Your word, and according to Your own heart's desire, You have done all these great things, so that You might make them known to Your servant.”
2 Kings 7:22 “For this reason, You are magnified, Lord God, for there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, in all that we have heard with our own ears.”
2 Kings 7:23 “And what other nation on earth is like Your people Israel, whom You went to redeem for Yourself as a people, and to make a name for Yourself, and to perform great and terrible things for them on the earth, delivering them from the face of Your nation whom You redeemed for Yourself out of Egypt, from their peoples and their false worship?”
2 Kings 7:24 “And You have established Your people Israel for Yourself as a people forever; and You, O Lord, have become their God.”
2 Kings 7:25 “Now therefore, Lord God, the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, fulfill it eternally; and do as You have spoken.”
2 Kings 7:26 “So that Your name may be magnified forever, and people may say: ‘The Lord of hosts is God over Israel,’ and the house of Your servant David may be established before You.”
2 Kings 7:27 “For You, Lord of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to Your servant, by whispering in his ear, saying: ‘I will build a house for you.’ Because of this, Your servant has found the courage in his heart to pray this prayer to You.”
2 Kings 7:28 “Now therefore, Lord God, You are God, and Your words will be true; for You have spoken these good things to Your servant.”
2 Kings 7:29 “Begin therefore and bless the house of Your servant, so that it may be forever before You; for You, Lord God, have spoken, and with Your blessing, the house of Your servant will be blessed eternally.”

2 Kings 7:1 Then Elisha said, "Hear the word of the Lord! This is what the Lord says: At this very hour tomorrow, a seah (a measure) of fine flour will be sold for three shekels (a unit of silver currency), and two seahs of barley for four shekels, right at the market gate of Samaria."
2 Kings 7:2 However, one of the king's officers, who was responsible for the king's personal safety and whose arm the king leaned upon, answered the man of God, saying, "Even if the Lord were to open the floodgates of the sky, could such a thing actually happen?" And Elisha said, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it."
2 Kings 7:3 Now there were four men who had leprosy sitting near the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, "Why are we sitting here until we die?"
2 Kings 7:4 If we go into the city, we will die there because of the famine. If we stay here, we will surely die. So come on, let's desert to the camp of the Arameans (Syrians). If they spare our lives, we will live. If they kill us, then we will simply die.
2 Kings 7:5 So they got up in the evening to go to the camp of the Arameans. When they came to the edge of the Aramean camp, they found no one there.
2 Kings 7:6 For the Lord had made the Aramean army hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a very large army. So they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come and attack us!"
2 Kings 7:7 Because of this, they got up and fled silently in the evening, abandoning their tents, their horses, their donkeys in the camp, and everything just as it was. They simply fled for their lives.
2 Kings 7:8 So when those men with leprosy came to the edge of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank. They took silver, gold, and clothing from there, and went and hid them. Then they returned to another tent and likewise took things from there and hid them.
2 Kings 7:9 Then they said to one another, "What we are doing is not right. This is a day of good news, and if we keep silent and do not report it until morning, we will be held accountable for our wickedness. Come now, let's go and report it to the king's palace."
2 Kings 7:10 So they went and called out to the gatekeepers of the city, saying, "We went to the camp of the Arameans, and we found no one there, nor any sound of a human, but only horses and donkeys tied up, and the tents just as they were left."
2 Kings 7:11 The gatekeepers then went and announced the news inside the king's palace.
2 Kings 7:12 The king rose up in the night and said to his servants, "I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are suffering from famine, and that is why they have left their camp and hidden themselves in the fields. They are thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive and then enter the city.'"
2 Kings 7:13 One of his servants answered him and said, "Let's take five of the remaining horses in the city, because the entire population of Israel remaining in it will be like those who are already dead. Indeed, the entire population of Israel is almost consumed by the famine. Let us send them out and see what is happening."
2 Kings 7:14 So they took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them to the Aramean camp, saying, "Go and see."
2 Kings 7:15 They went after them as far as the Jordan River. And behold, the entire road was full of garments and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their haste when they were in a panic. The messengers returned and reported this to the king.
2 Kings 7:16 Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of fine flour was sold for three shekels, and two seahs of barley for four shekels, exactly as the Lord had spoken.
2 Kings 7:17 Now the king had put that officer, on whose arm he leaned, in charge of the city gate. But the crowd trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had prophesied when the king came down to speak with him.
2 Kings 7:18 So it happened exactly according to the word of the man of God, which he had spoken to the king when he said: "Two seahs of barley will be sold for four shekels, and a seah of fine flour for three shekels, tomorrow at the gate of Samaria."
2 Kings 7:19 And when that officer had answered him and said, "What if the Lord were to open the floodgates of the sky, could such a thing actually happen?" Elisha had said to him, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it."
2 Kings 7:20 And it happened to him just as it had been said, because the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.
2 Kings 8:1 Eliseus then spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, telling her: 'Get up, and go, you and your entire household, and reside as a foreigner wherever you can; for the Lord has commanded a devastating famine upon this land, and it will last for seven years.'
2 Kings 8:2 So the woman got up, and she left with all of her household, and they resided as foreigners in the land of the Philistines for the entire seven years.
2 Kings 8:3 And when the seven years were finished, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. And she went to appeal to the king about her house and her fields, which had likely been taken by others.
2 Kings 8:4 Now, the king was speaking with Giezi, the servant of the man of God, Eliseus. The king was saying: 'Tell me all the great things Eliseus has done.'
2 Kings 8:5 As Giezi was telling how Eliseus had raised the dead boy back to life, the very woman whose son Eliseus had restored to life appeared, crying out to the king concerning her house and her fields. Then Giezi said: 'My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Eliseus brought back to life.'
2 Kings 8:6 And the king questioned the woman, and she told him her story. Then the king gave her an official, saying: 'Restore to her all that is hers, and all the income from her fields, from the day she left the land until now.'
2 Kings 8:7 Eliseus also went to Damascus, and Benadad, the king of Syria, was sick. And it was announced to him, with people saying: 'The man of God has come here!'
2 Kings 8:8 And the king said to Hazaël, one of his officials: 'Take gifts with you, and go to meet the man of God, and consult the Lord through him, asking: "Will I recover from this illness?"'
2 Kings 8:9 So Hazaël went to meet him, bringing gifts with him—all the good things of Damascus, a load for forty camels. And when he arrived, he stood before Eliseus and said: 'Your son Benadad, the king of Syria, has sent me to you, asking: "Will I recover from this illness?"'
2 Kings 8:10 And Eliseus said to him: 'Go, tell him: "You will surely recover"— but the Lord has shown me that he will certainly die.'
2 Kings 8:11 And Eliseus stood with him, staring intently. Hazaël became troubled and embarrassed, and then the man of God, Eliseus, wept.
2 Kings 8:12 To him, Hazaël said: 'Why is my lord weeping?' Eliseus answered: 'Because I know what evils you will inflict upon the children of Israel: you will set their fortified cities on fire, you will kill their young men with the sword, you will dash their little ones to pieces, and you will rip open their pregnant women.'
2 Kings 8:13 And Hazaël said: 'What is your servant, a mere dog, that I should do such a great evil?' And Eliseus said: 'The Lord has shown me that you will be king over Syria.'
2 Kings 8:14 And when he had departed from Eliseus, he came to his master. Who said to him: 'What did Eliseus say to you?' And he answered: 'He told me: "You will surely recover."
2 Kings 8:15 But the very next day, Hazaël took a thick cloth, soaked it in water, and spread it over Benadad’s face, smothering him. And when he was dead, Hazaël reigned in his place.
2 Kings 8:16 In the fifth year of Joram, son of Achab, king of Israel, while Josaphat was king of Juda, Joram, son of Josaphat, king of Juda, began to reign.
2 Kings 8:17 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings 8:18 And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Achab had walked, because a daughter of Achab was his wife. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Kings 8:19 However, the Lord would not destroy Juda, for the sake of David, His servant, just as He had promised him by speaking, and by giving him a lamp—a continuous line of descendants—and to his sons for all days.
2 Kings 8:20 In his days, Edom revolted so that it would no longer be under the rule of Juda, and it appointed a king for itself.
2 Kings 8:21 So Joram went to Seira, and all the chariots with him. And he rose up in the night and attacked the Idumeans who had surrounded him, along with the commanders of their chariots; but the people fled to their tents.
2 Kings 8:22 Therefore Edom revolted from being under Juda, and it remains so to this present day. At that same time, Libna also revolted.
2 Kings 8:23 Now, the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
2 Kings 8:24 And Joram slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the City of David. And Ochozias, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram, son of Achab, king of Israel, Ochozias, son of Joram, king of Juda, began to reign.
2 Kings 8:26 Ochozias was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athalia, daughter of Amri, king of Israel.
2 Kings 8:27 And he walked in the ways of the house of Achab, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just like the house of Achab, for he was a son-in-law of Achab.
2 Kings 8:28 He also went with Joram, son of Achab, to war against Hazaël, king of Syria, in Ramoth Galaad; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Kings 8:29 So Joram returned to be healed in Jezraël because of the wounds that the Syrians had inflicted on him in Ramoth, when he fought against Hazaël, the king of Syria. And Ochozias, son of Joram, king of Juda, went down to visit Joram, son of Achab, who was sick in Jezraël.
2 Kings 8:1 But Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, "Rise up, you and your household, and go live as a foreigner wherever you can; for the Lord has called a famine upon the land, and it will last for seven years."
2 Kings 8:2 So she rose up and went with all her household, and lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
2 Kings 8:3 When the seven years were finished, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, and she went out to appeal to the king concerning her house and her fields.
2 Kings 8:4 Now the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, "Tell me all the great works that Elisha has done."
2 Kings 8:5 As Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had raised the dead, the very woman whose son Elisha had restored to life appeared, crying out to the king concerning her house and her fields. And Gehazi said, "My lord king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha raised from the dead!"
2 Kings 8:6 The king then questioned the woman, and she told him her story. So the king gave her an official, saying, "Restore to her all that belonged to her, and all the income from her fields, from the day she left the land until now."
2 Kings 8:7 Now Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-hadad king of Syria was sick. They reported to him, saying, "The man of God has come here!"
2 Kings 8:8 And the king said to Hazael, "Take gifts with you, and go meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord through him, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
2 Kings 8:9 So Hazael went to meet Elisha, carrying gifts with him, all the good things of Damascus, a load for forty camels. When he came, he stood before him and said, "Your son Ben-hadad, king of Syria, has sent me to you, saying, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
2 Kings 8:10 And Elisha said to him, "Go, tell him, 'You will certainly recover.' However, the Lord has shown me that he will surely die a different death."
2 Kings 8:11 Then Elisha stared fixedly until Hazael was confused and ashamed; and the man of God wept.
2 Kings 8:12 And Hazael said, "Why does my lord weep?" He answered, "Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: you will burn their fortified cities with fire, and you will kill their young men with the sword, and you will dash their little ones to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women."
2 Kings 8:13 To which Hazael said, "Who is your servant, my lord, but a dog, that I should do this great evil?" And Elisha said, "The Lord has shown me that you will be king of Syria."
2 Kings 8:14 So he departed from Elisha and came to his master. And Ben-hadad said to him, "What did Elisha say to you?" And Hazael answered, "He told me, 'You will recover your health.'"
2 Kings 8:15 But the next day, Hazael took a thick blanket, soaked it in water, and spread it over Ben-hadad's face, so he suffocated. When Ben-hadad was dead, Hazael reigned in his place.
2 Kings 8:16 In the fifth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king of Israel—while Jehoshaphat was still king of Judah—Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, began to reign as king of Judah.
2 Kings 8:17 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings 8:18 And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had walked, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Kings 8:19 However, the Lord was unwilling to destroy Judah for the sake of David His servant, just as He had promised him that He would give him a lamp, a line of descendants, for all days.
2 Kings 8:20 In his days, Edom revolted from being under the rule of Judah and appointed a king for themselves.
2 Kings 8:21 So Jehoram went to Zair, and all his chariots with him; and he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots. Then the people fled to their tents.
2 Kings 8:22 Thus Edom revolted from being under Judah to this present day. At that time, Libnah also revolted.
2 Kings 8:23 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 8:24 And Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David; and Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.
2 Kings 8:26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.
2 Kings 8:27 And he walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the Lord, just like the house of Ahab, for he was a son-in-law of Ahab's house.
2 Kings 8:28 He also went with Joram, son of Ahab, to fight against Hazael, king of Syria, in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Kings 8:29 So Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds with which the Syrians had struck him at Ramoth, when he fought against Hazael, king of Syria. And Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to visit Joram, son of Ahab, in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2 Kings 8:1 Elisha had spoken to the woman whose son he had brought back to life, saying: "Get up and leave, you and your household, and find a place to live as a foreigner wherever you can, because the Lord has called for a famine to come upon the land, and it will last for seven years."
2 Kings 8:2 So she got up and left with all her household, and lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
2 Kings 8:3 And when the seven years were completed, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. She went out to appeal to the king concerning her house and her fields, seeking their restoration.
2 Kings 8:4 Meanwhile, the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying: "Tell me all the great and powerful things that Elisha has done."
2 Kings 8:5 And just as Gehazi was telling how Elisha had brought a dead person back to life, the very woman appeared, whose son Elisha had restored to life, crying out to the king about her house and her fields. Gehazi then said: "My lord king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life."
2 Kings 8:6 And the king questioned the woman, and she told him her story. So the king gave her an official, saying: "Restore to her all that belongs to her, and all her fields from the day she left the land until now."
2 Kings 8:7 Elisha also came to Damascus, when Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, was sick. And they announced to the king, saying: "The man of God has come here."
2 Kings 8:8 And the king said to Hazael: "Take gifts with you, and go to meet the man of God. Consult the Lord through him, saying: 'Will I be able to recover from this illness?'"
2 Kings 8:9 So Hazael went to meet Elisha, carrying gifts with him, and all the good things of Damascus, a load for forty camels. And when he stood before him, he said: "Your son Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, has sent me to you, saying: 'Will I be able to recover from this illness?'"
2 Kings 8:10 And Elisha said to him: "Go and tell him: 'You will certainly recover.' However, the Lord has shown me that he will nevertheless surely die by other means."
2 Kings 8:11 And the man of God stood there, troubled, and then wept.
2 Kings 8:12 Hazael said to him: "Why does my lord weep?" And Elisha said: "Because I know the evils you will inflict upon the children of Israel: you will burn their strongholds with fire, you will kill their young men with the sword, you will dash their little ones to pieces, and you will rip open their pregnant women."
2 Kings 8:13 And Hazael said: "But what am I, your servant, a mere dog, that I should do such a great deed?" And Elisha said: "The Lord has shown me that you will be king of Syria."
2 Kings 8:14 And when he had departed from Elisha, he came to his master, who asked him: "What did Elisha say to you?" And Hazael responded: "He told me: 'You will certainly recover.'"
2 Kings 8:15 However, the next day, Hazael took a thick cloth, soaked it in water, and spread it over Ben-Hadad's face, so that he suffocated and died. And Hazael reigned in his place.
2 Kings 8:16 In the fifth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, and while Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Joram, son of Jehoshaphat, became king of Judah.
2 Kings 8:17 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings 8:18 And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had walked, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Kings 8:19 Yet the Lord was unwilling to destroy Judah, for the sake of His servant David, just as He had promised him that He would always give him and his sons a lamp, meaning a perpetual lineage on the throne.
2 Kings 8:20 In those days, Edom revolted and separated from the control of Judah, and set up a king for themselves.
2 Kings 8:21 So Joram went to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him; but the rest of the Edomite people had already fled to their tents.
2 Kings 8:22 And Edom remained separate from the control of Judah until this present day. At that time, Libnah also revolted.
2 Kings 8:23 The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 8:24 And Joram rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. Then Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah, son of Joram, king of Judah, began to reign.
2 Kings 8:26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah, daughter of Omri, king of Israel.
2 Kings 8:27 And he walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as the house of Ahab did; for he was allied by marriage to the house of Ahab.
2 Kings 8:28 He also went with Joram, son of Ahab, to fight against Hazael, king of Syria, in Ramoth-Gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Kings 8:29 Joram then returned to Jezreel to recover, because the Syrians had wounded him in Ramah when he fought against Hazael, king of Syria. Ahaziah also, son of Joram, king of Judah, went down to Jezreel to visit Joram, son of Ahab, because he was sick.
2 Kings 9:1 Elisha the prophet called one of the disciples of the prophets and said to him, 'Prepare yourself for travel, and take this small jar of oil with you in your hand, then go to Ramoth Gilead.'
2 Kings 9:2 When you arrive there, find Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, who is the son of Nimshi. When you find him, take him away from his companions and lead him into a hidden private chamber.
2 Kings 9:3 Then, take the jar of oil and pour it over his head, saying: 'This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you to be king over Israel.' After you have done this, open the door, flee immediately, and do not delay.
2 Kings 9:4 So the young man, the prophet's disciple, went to Ramoth Gilead.
2 Kings 9:5 When he arrived, behold, the commanders of the army were sitting together. He said, 'I have a message for you, commander.'
2 Kings 9:6 Jehu asked, 'Which of us are you speaking to?'
2 Kings 9:null He replied, 'To you, commander.'
2 Kings 9:7 So Jehu got up and went into the private chamber. The young man poured the oil over his head and said to him, 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I have anointed you king over the Lord's people, Israel.'
2 Kings 9:8 'You are to strike down the household of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the Lord's servants, at the hand of Jezebel.'
2 Kings 9:9 'I will destroy the house of Ahab. I will cut off from Ahab every male, both slave and free, in Israel.'
2 Kings 9:10 'I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.'
2 Kings 9:11 'As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her body in the field of Jezreel, and no one will bury her.'
2 Kings 9:12 Then he opened the door and fled, just as Elisha commanded.
2 Kings 9:13 When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they asked him, 'Is everything all right? What did that madman want with you?'
2 Kings 9:14 He answered them, 'You know the man and what he said.'
2 Kings 9:15 But they insisted, 'That's not true! Tell us what he said!'
2 Kings 9:null He then told them, 'He said such and such to me, saying: 'This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you king over Israel.''
2 Kings 9:16 They quickly took off their cloaks, and each man spread his own under Jehu's feet, forming an impromptu royal carpet. Then they sounded the trumpet and shouted, 'Jehu is king!'
2 Kings 9:17 So Jehu plotted against Joram. Now Joram, along with all of Israel, was guarding Ramoth Gilead against Hazael, the king of Syria.
2 Kings 9:18 King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted upon him when he fought against Hazael, the king of Syria.
2 Kings 9:null Jehu then said, 'If you are with me, let no one escape from the city to go and report this news in Jezreel.'
2 Kings 9:19 So Jehu mounted his chariot and rode to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there wounded. Ahaziah, the king of Judah, had also come down to visit Joram.
2 Kings 9:20 Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel. He saw Jehu approaching with his company and exclaimed, 'I see a chariot approaching!'
2 Kings 9:21 Joram said, 'Harness my chariot!'
2 Kings 9:null So they harnessed his chariot, and King Joram of Israel, along with King Ahaziah of Judah, each in their own chariots, went out to meet Jehu. They encountered him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2 Kings 9:22 When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, 'Is it peace, Jehu?'
2 Kings 9:null Jehu replied, 'What peace can there be? The harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her many sorceries are still flourishing!'
2 Kings 9:23 Then Joram turned his chariot around to flee, crying out to Ahaziah, 'Treachery, Ahaziah!'
2 Kings 9:24 But Jehu drew his bow with his own hand and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he immediately collapsed in his chariot.
2 Kings 9:25 Jehu then said to Bidkar, his captain, 'Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how, when you and I were riding in chariots behind Ahab his father, the Lord pronounced this sentence against him, saying:'
2 Kings 9:26 'Surely I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday,' says the Lord, 'and I will repay you in this very field,' says the Lord. 'So now, take him and throw him into the field, according to the word of the Lord.'
2 Kings 9:27 When Ahaziah, the king of Judah, saw this, he fled by the road of the garden house. Jehu pursued him and said, 'Strike him down too, in his chariot!'
2 Kings 9:null They struck him down at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo and died there.
2 Kings 9:28 His servants carried him in his chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.
2 Kings 9:29 In the eleventh year of Joram, son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.
2 Kings 9:30 So Jehu came to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about his arrival, she painted her eyes with dark makeup, arranged her hair, and looked out a window.
2 Kings 9:31 As Jehu entered the city gate, she called out, 'Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?'
2 Kings 9:32 Jehu looked up to the window and called out, 'Who is on my side? Who?'
2 Kings 9:null Two or three eunuchs looked out to him.
2 Kings 9:33 He said to them, 'Throw her down!' So they threw her down. Her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and she was trampled underfoot.
2 Kings 9:34 After Jehu went in, and had eaten and drunk, he said, 'Go and look after that cursed woman and bury her, for she was a king's daughter.'
2 Kings 9:35 But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.
2 Kings 9:36 When they returned and reported this to him, Jehu said, 'This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 'In the field of Jezreel, dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel.''
2 Kings 9:37 'The corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the field of Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say: 'This is Jezebel.'' This is her fate.
2 Kings 9:1 Now, Elisha the prophet called one of the young men from the school of the prophets, and said to him, 'Prepare yourself for a journey and take this flask of anointing oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead.
2 Kings 9:2 When you get there, find Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go inside, call to him, and then bring him away from his companions, leading him into an inner room where you can speak with him privately.
2 Kings 9:3 Then take the flask of oil and pour it over his head, saying, 'This is what the Lord declares: I have anointed you king over Israel.' After you have done this, open the door, flee quickly, and do not stay there.
2 Kings 9:4 So the young prophet departed for Ramoth-Gilead.
2 Kings 9:5 When he arrived, behold, the commanders of the army were sitting together. The prophet said, 'I have a message for you, commander.' Jehu asked, 'For which of us, among all of us here?' And he answered, 'For you, commander.'
2 Kings 9:6 So Jehu got up and went into the inner room. The prophet then poured the oil over his head and declared, 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I have anointed you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel.
2 Kings 9:7 You are to strike down the house of Ahab, your master. I will avenge the blood of my servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the Lord’s servants who were murdered by Jezebel.'
2 Kings 9:8 Indeed, I will destroy the entire house of Ahab. I will cut off from Ahab every male descendant, both slave and free, in Israel.
2 Kings 9:9 I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.
2 Kings 9:10 And as for Jezebel, dogs will devour her in the territory of Jezreel, and no one will bury her body.
2 Kings 9:11 Then the young prophet opened the door and fled, just as Elisha had commanded him.
2 Kings 9:12 When Jehu came out to his master’s servants, they asked him, 'Is everything well? Why did this madman come to you?' He replied to them, 'You know the man and what he might say.'
2 Kings 9:13 But they insisted, 'No, that is not true; tell us instead!' So he told them, 'He said to me exactly this: 'This is what the Lord declares: I have anointed you king over Israel.''
2 Kings 9:14 Immediately, each of them quickly took off his cloak and spread it under Jehu’s feet, as if making a royal throne. Then they blew the trumpet and proclaimed, 'Jehu is now king!'
2 Kings 9:15 So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. Now Joram had been defending Ramoth-Gilead, along with all of Israel, against Hazael, the king of Syria.
2 Kings 9:16 King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he received from the Syrians while fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. Jehu then commanded, 'If it is agreeable to you, let no one escape from the city to go and report this news in Jezreel.'
2 Kings 9:17 So Jehu mounted his chariot and headed for Jezreel, because Joram was convalescing there, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, had come down to visit him.
2 Kings 9:18 Now, the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw Jehu’s company approaching in their chariots. He called out, 'I see chariots coming!' Joram said, 'Send a horseman to meet them and ask if they come in peace.'
2 Kings 9:19 So a horseman went out to meet him and asked, 'The king asks, 'Do you come in peace?'' Jehu replied, 'What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!' The watchman reported, 'The messenger reached them, but he is not returning.'
2 Kings 9:20 Then Joram sent a second horseman, who came to them and asked, 'The king asks, 'Do you come in peace?'' And Jehu answered, 'What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!'
2 Kings 9:21 The watchman reported again, saying, 'He reached them, but he is not returning. The way the chariot is being driven is like the furious driving of Jehu, the son of Nimshi, for he drives with great speed.'
2 Kings 9:22 Then Joram exclaimed, 'Prepare my chariot!' So they prepared his chariot. King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah each went out in their own chariots, and they rode to meet Jehu. They encountered him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2 Kings 9:23 When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, 'Do you come in peace, Jehu?' He replied, 'How can there be peace, as long as the many immoral acts and sorceries of your mother Jezebel are still thriving?'
2 Kings 9:24 Joram then quickly turned his chariot to flee and shouted to Ahaziah, 'Treachery, Ahaziah! It’s an ambush!'
2 Kings 9:25 But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow pierced through his heart, and he immediately collapsed in his chariot.
2 Kings 9:26 Jehu then said to Bidkar, his aide, 'Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I were riding together in a chariot behind Ahab, your father? The Lord then laid this prophecy as a burden upon him, saying:'
2 Kings 9:27 'Surely I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday, says the Lord, and I will repay you in this very field, says the Lord.' Now therefore, pick him up and throw him into the field, fulfilling the word of the Lord.
2 Kings 9:28 When Ahaziah, the king of Judah, saw this, he fled by way of the garden house. Jehu pursued him and commanded, 'Strike this one down too!' And they struck him down in his chariot on the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He then escaped to Megiddo and died there.
2 Kings 9:29 His servants took his body in a chariot and brought him to Jerusalem, where they buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.
2 Kings 9:30 Jehu then arrived in Jezreel. When Jezebel heard of his arrival, she painted her eyes with kohl, adorned her head, and looked out from a window.
2 Kings 9:31 As Jehu entered the city gate, Jezebel called out, 'Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?' —comparing him to a previous king who assassinated his lord.
2 Kings 9:32 Jehu looked up to the window and called out, 'Who is on my side? Who?' And two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
2 Kings 9:33 He said to them, 'Throw her down!' So they threw her down. Her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and her body was trampled underfoot.
2 Kings 9:34 Then Jehu went inside, ate, and drank. Afterward, he commanded, 'Go now and see to that cursed woman, and bury her, for after all, she was a king’s daughter.'
2 Kings 9:35 But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.
2 Kings 9:36 So they returned and reported this to him. Jehu then declared, 'This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 'In the territory of Jezreel, dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel.'
2 Kings 9:37 And the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one will be able to identify her and say, 'This was Jezebel.'
2 Kings 9:38 There is no verse 38 in the Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings chapter 9. This appears to be an error in the request or a numbering divergence.
2 Kings 9:39 There is no verse 39 in the Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings chapter 9. This appears to be an error in the request or a numbering divergence.
2 Kings 9:40 There is no verse 40 in the Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings chapter 9. This appears to be an error in the request or a numbering divergence.
2 Kings 9:1 Now, Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and told him: "Prepare yourself for a journey, take this small flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead."
2 Kings 9:2 When you arrive there, you will see Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go inside, call him away from his companions, and bring him into an inner room.
2 Kings 9:3 Then, take the flask of oil, pour it over his head, and say: "This is what the Lord says: 'I have anointed you king over Israel.'" Then, open the door, flee immediately, and do not delay.
2 Kings 9:4 So the young prophet went to Ramoth-Gilead.
2 Kings 9:5 He arrived and went in to the commanders of the army, and Jehu was sitting among them. The prophet said, "I have a message for you, commander." Jehu asked, "For which one of us?" The prophet replied, "For you, commander."
2 Kings 9:6 So Jehu stood up and went into the inner room. The prophet then poured the oil over his head and declared: "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'I have anointed you king over the Lord's people, Israel.'"
2 Kings 9:7 "And you will strike down the house of Ahab, your master, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the Lord’s servants, from the hand of Jezebel."
2 Kings 9:8 "I will utterly destroy the entire house of Ahab. I will cut off from Ahab every male, both slave and free, the last person remaining in Israel."
2 Kings 9:9 "And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah."
2 Kings 9:10 "As for Jezebel, dogs will eat her flesh in the field of Jezreel, and no one will bury her." Then the prophet opened the door and fled.
2 Kings 9:11 Jehu then went out to the servants of his master. They asked him, "Is everything alright? Why did that madman come to you?" He replied to them, "You know the man and what he said."
2 Kings 9:12 But they insisted, "That's not true! Tell us what he really said!" So he told them, "He said to me such and such, and then he declared, 'This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you king over Israel.'"
2 Kings 9:13 So they immediately rushed, and each man took his cloak, spread it under Jehu's feet like a royal carpet, and sounded the trumpet, proclaiming, "Jehu is king!"
2 Kings 9:14 Thus, Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now, Joram had been defending Ramoth-Gilead, along with all of Israel, against Hazael, the king of Syria.)
2 Kings 9:15 King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had received from the Syrians while fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. Jehu then said, "If you agree with my plan, let no one escape from the city to go and report this news in Jezreel."
2 Kings 9:16 Jehu then mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was recovering there, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, had come down to visit Joram.
2 Kings 9:17 The lookout who was standing on the watchtower in Jezreel saw Jehu's chariot approaching and reported, "I see a chariot coming!" Joram said, "It's still far off. Send a messenger to meet him and ask: 'Is all well?'"
2 Kings 9:18 So the messenger went to meet him and said, "The king asks: 'Is all well?'" Jehu replied, "What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!" The lookout reported again, saying, "The messenger reached them, but he is not returning."
2 Kings 9:19 Joram then sent a second chariot with horses, and this messenger also reached them and asked, "The king asks: 'Is all well?'" Jehu again replied, "What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!"
2 Kings 9:20 The lookout reported again, saying, "He reached them and is not returning. The driving is like the driving of Jehu, the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously."
2 Kings 9:21 Joram said, "Harness my chariot!" So they harnessed his chariot, and King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah each went out in their own chariots. They rode to meet Jehu and found him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2 Kings 9:22 When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, "Is all well, Jehu?" But Jehu responded, "How can there be peace, as long as the many idolatries and sorceries of your mother Jezebel continue to thrive?"
2 Kings 9:23 Joram immediately turned his chariot around and fled, shouting to Ahaziah, "Treason, Ahaziah!"
2 Kings 9:24 Then Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he immediately collapsed in his chariot.
2 Kings 9:25 Jehu then said to Bidkar, his officer, "Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I were riding together in a chariot behind Ahab, this man's father, that the Lord laid this burden upon him, saying:"
2 Kings 9:26 "'Surely I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday, says the Lord, and I will repay you in this very field.' Therefore, pick him up now and throw him into the field, according to the word of the Lord."
2 Kings 9:27 King Ahaziah of Judah, seeing this, fled by way of the garden house. But Jehu pursued him and commanded, "Strike him down also in his chariot!" So they struck him down on the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He managed to flee to Megiddo, but he died there.
2 Kings 9:28 His servants then placed him in his own chariot and brought him to Jerusalem, where they buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David.
2 Kings 9:29 In the eleventh year of Joram, son of Ahab, Ahaziah began his reign over Judah.
2 Kings 9:30 Jehu then arrived in Jezreel. When Jezebel heard of his coming, she put on her eye makeup, adorned her head, and looked out of the window.
2 Kings 9:31 As Jehu entered through the gate, she called out, "Is it peace, you Zimri, who murdered his master?"
2 Kings 9:32 Jehu then looked up toward the window and asked, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
2 Kings 9:33 He commanded them, "Throw her down!" So they threw her down. Her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and she was trampled underfoot.
2 Kings 9:34 Jehu then went inside to eat and drink. Afterward, he said, "Go, inspect the body of that cursed woman and bury her, because after all, she was a king's daughter."
2 Kings 9:35 But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.
2 Kings 9:36 They returned and reported this to him. Jehu said, "This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 'In the field of Jezreel, dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel.'"
2 Kings 9:37 "And the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the field of Jezreel, so that those who pass by will say, 'Is this really that Jezebel?'"
2 Kings 9:1 Elisha the prophet called one of the prophets' disciples and said to him, 'Prepare yourself for travel, take this flask of anointing oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead.'
2 Kings 9:2 When you arrive there, look for Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the grandson of Nimshi. Go in, close the door of the room securely, take him aside from his companions, and lead him into a private, inner room.
2 Kings 9:3 Then take the flask of anointing oil and pour it over his head, saying, 'The Lord declares this: I have anointed you as king over Israel.' After you have done this, open the door, flee immediately, and do not wait there for anything.
2 Kings 9:4 So the young man, the prophet's servant, went to Ramoth-Gilead.
2 Kings 9:5 He entered the room where the army commanders were gathered. Jehu was sitting among his fellow officers. The young man said, 'I have a message for you, commander.'
2 Kings 9:6 Jehu asked, 'For which one of us?' The young man replied, 'For you, commander.'
2 Kings 9:7 Jehu stood up and went into the private room. There, the young prophet poured the oil over his head and declared, 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says: I have anointed you as king over the Lord's people, over Israel.'
2 Kings 9:8 You must strike down the household of Ahab your master. Through your hand, I will avenge the blood of My servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the Lord's servants, against Jezebel.
2 Kings 9:9 I will utterly destroy the entire household of Ahab. I will cut off from Ahab every male, both slave and free, in Israel.
2 Kings 9:10 I will make the household of Ahab like the household of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the household of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.
2 Kings 9:11 And as for Jezebel, dogs will devour her in the field of Jezreel, and there will be no one to bury her.' After saying this, the young prophet opened the door and fled.
2 Kings 9:12 When Jehu returned to his master's officers, they asked him, 'Is everything alright? Why did that madman come to you?'
2 Kings 9:13 He replied to them, 'You know the man, and you know what he said.'
2 Kings 9:14 But they said, 'Don't lie to us; tell us honestly.' So he told them, 'He said such and such to me, saying: "The Lord declares this: I have anointed you as king over Israel."'
2 Kings 9:15 They quickly took each man's cloak and laid it beneath Jehu, like a royal carpet on a raised platform. Then they blew the trumpet and proclaimed, 'Jehu is king!'
2 Kings 9:16 So Jehu plotted against Joram, Ahab's son, who was in Jezreel. Joram, along with all Israel, had been defending Ramoth-Gilead.
2 Kings 9:17 Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from wounds inflicted by the Arameans when he fought against Hazael, the king of Aram. Jehu declared, 'If you are in agreement with me, let no one escape from the city to go and report this news in Jezreel.'
2 Kings 9:18 Then Jehu mounted his chariot and rode to Jezreel, where King Joram was recuperating. Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also come down to visit Joram.
2 Kings 9:19 A watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu approaching with his company of men and exclaimed, 'I see a chariot approaching!' Joram said, 'Send a rider on horseback to meet them and ask, "Is it peace?"'
2 Kings 9:20 So a horseman rode out to meet him and asked, 'The king asks, "Is it peace?"' Jehu replied, 'What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!' The watchman reported again, saying, 'The messenger reached them, but he is not returning.'
2 Kings 9:21 So Joram sent out a second horseman. When he reached them, he asked, 'The king asks, "Is it peace?"' Jehu replied, 'What concern is peace to you? Turn around and follow me!'
2 Kings 9:22 The watchman reported, 'He reached them as well, but he is not returning. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu, son of Nimshi—he drives like a madman.'
2 Kings 9:23 Joram then commanded, 'Harness my chariot!' So they harnessed his chariot. King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah each went out in their own chariots, riding to meet Jehu. They encountered him in the field that belonged to Naboth of Jezreel.
2 Kings 9:24 When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, 'Is it peace, Jehu?' Jehu replied, 'What peace can there be, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her many sorceries are still flourishing?'
2 Kings 9:25 Joram immediately turned his chariot to flee and cried out to Ahaziah, 'Treachery, Ahaziah!'
2 Kings 9:26 But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and struck Joram between his shoulders. The arrow pierced through his heart, and he collapsed instantly in his chariot.
2 Kings 9:27 Then Jehu ordered Bidkar, his officer, 'Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I were riding in chariots behind Ahab, this man's father, how the Lord laid this burden upon him, saying:'
2 Kings 9:28 '"Surely I have seen the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, which was shed yesterday," declares the Lord. "And I will repay you in this very field," declares the Lord. Now, therefore, pick him up and throw him into the field, according to the word of the Lord.'
2 Kings 9:29 King Ahaziah of Judah saw what happened and fled by way of the garden house. Jehu pursued him and commanded, 'Strike him down in his chariot too!' So they struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He managed to escape to Megiddo, but he died there.
2 Kings 9:30 His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.
2 Kings 9:31 When Jehu arrived in Jezreel, Jezebel heard about his coming. She painted her eyelids with kohl, adorned her head with jewels, and looked out from a window.
2 Kings 9:32 As Jehu entered the gate, she called out, 'Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?'
2 Kings 9:33 Jehu looked up toward the window and asked, 'Who is on my side? Who?' Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
2 Kings 9:34 He commanded them, 'Throw her down!' So they threw her down. Some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses' hooves, and Jehu's chariot trampled over her.
2 Kings 9:35 Then Jehu went inside, ate and drank. Afterward, he said, 'Go and see to that accursed woman's corpse and bury her, for she was a king's daughter.'
2 Kings 9:36 But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.
2 Kings 9:37 When they returned and reported this to Jehu, he said, 'This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: "In the field of Jezreel, dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh."
2 Kings 9:38 And the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the field of Jezreel, so that those passing by will say: "Is this truly that Jezebel?"'
2 Kings 9:39 For Jezebel will not be in the earth, nor will there be a place where she can be buried. Instead, her remains will be scattered in the plain of Jezreel like dung on the surface of the ground, so completely that no one will be able to recognize her remains.
2 Kings 9:40 Thus, the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the ground in the field of Jezreel, so that those passing by will say: 'Is this truly that Jezebel?' For she will not be in the earth, nor will there be a place where Jezebel can be buried. Instead, her remains will be scattered in the plain of Jezreel like dung on the surface of the ground, so completely that no one will be able to recognize her remains.
2 Kings 10:1 Now King Ahab had seventy sons living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and dispatched them to Samaria, addressing them to the city's officials, its elders, and those who were responsible for raising Ahab's sons, with this message:
2 Kings 10:2 "Since your lord's sons are with you, and you have chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons,
2 Kings 10:3 choose the best and most capable among your lord's sons, and place him on his father's throne. Then, fight for the family and household of your lord."
2 Kings 10:4 But the officials were terrified, and they said: "Look, two kings—King Joram and King Ahaziah—could not stand against him. How then can we possibly resist him?"
2 Kings 10:5 So the royal steward, the city governor, the elders, and the guardians of the sons sent a message back to Jehu, saying: "We are your servants, and we will do whatever you command us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever you deem best."
2 Kings 10:6 Then Jehu wrote to them a second time, saying: "If you are truly on my side and will obey me, then cut off the heads of your lord's sons, and come to meet me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow." Now, the king's seventy sons were living with the city's leading men, who were raising them.
2 Kings 10:7 When the letters reached them, they seized the king's sons and killed all seventy men. Then they placed their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
2 Kings 10:8 Then a messenger arrived and reported to Jehu, saying: "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." Jehu responded: "Arrange them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning."
2 Kings 10:9 When Jehu went out the next morning, he stood before the people and declared: "You are innocent in this matter. Indeed, I conspired against my lord and killed him; that is my responsibility. But who is responsible for slaying all these seventy men?"
2 Kings 10:10 Know therefore that not a single word spoken by the Lord against the house of Ahab has failed to come true. The Lord has accomplished what He declared through His servant Elijah."
2 Kings 10:11 So Jehu struck down all who remained of Ahab's family and household in Jezreel, including all his leading men, his relatives, and his priests, until there was not a single person left from Ahab's line.
2 Kings 10:12 Then Jehu rose up and departed, traveling to Samaria. As he came to the Shepherds' House on the way,
2 Kings 10:13 he encountered the relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah and asked them: "Who are you?" They replied: "We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen."
2 Kings 10:14 Jehu seized them and slaughtered forty-two men by the pit near the Shepherds' House, leaving not a single one alive.
2 Kings 10:15 When Jehu departed from there, he met Jehonadab son of Rechab. After greeting him, Jehu asked: "Is your heart as loyal to me as my heart is loyal to you and God's purpose?" Jehonadab answered: "It is." Then Jehu said: "If so, give me your hand." Jehonadab extended his hand, and Jehu pulled him up into his chariot.
2 Kings 10:16 Jehu then said to him: "Come with me, and witness my zeal for the Lord." So Jehu brought him into his chariot.
2 Kings 10:17 Upon entering Samaria, Jehu struck down all who remained of Ahab's family and household in that city, utterly destroying them, in fulfillment of the Lord's word spoken to Elijah.
2 Kings 10:18 Then Jehu gathered all the people and declared to them: "Ahab served Baal only a little, but I will serve him much more diligently."
2 Kings 10:19 Therefore, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests to me now. Let no one fail to come, for I am offering a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is absent will not live." Jehu was doing this with cunning intent, aiming to utterly destroy the worshippers of Baal.
2 Kings 10:20 And Jehu commanded: "Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal!" So it was proclaimed throughout the land.
2 Kings 10:21 Jehu also sent messengers throughout all Israel, and all the servants of Baal came. Not a single one remained who did not come. They entered the temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
2 Kings 10:22 Then Jehu said to the one in charge of the vestments: "Bring out the robes for all the servants of Baal." So the official brought out the robes for them.
2 Kings 10:23 When Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab entered the temple of Baal, Jehu said to the Baal worshippers: "Look carefully and make sure there is no servant of the Lord among you, but only servants of Baal."
2 Kings 10:24 Then the Baal worshippers proceeded to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Meanwhile, Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, warning them: "If any of the men whom I bring into your hands should escape, then your own life will be taken in exchange for his life."
2 Kings 10:25 As soon as Jehu had finished offering the burnt offering, he commanded his guards and officers: "Go in and strike them down! Let no one escape!" So the guards and officers struck them with the edge of the sword. Then they cast out the bodies and proceeded to the inner sanctuary of the temple of Baal.
2 Kings 10:26 They brought out the sacred pillar of Baal from the temple of Baal and burned it.
2 Kings 10:27 They also broke down the sacred pillar of Baal and completely tore down the temple of Baal. They turned it into a public latrine, and it remains so to this very day.
2 Kings 10:28 Thus Jehu utterly eradicated Baal worship from Israel.
2 Kings 10:29 However, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, specifically from worshipping the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.
2 Kings 10:30 Therefore, the Lord said to Jehu: "Because you have diligently carried out what was right and pleasing in My sight, and you have done everything I intended against the house of Ahab, your sons will sit on the throne of Israel for four generations."
2 Kings 10:31 Yet Jehu himself was not careful to walk in the Law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with his whole heart; for he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin.
2 Kings 10:32 In those days, the Lord began to diminish Israel. King Hazael of Aram struck them throughout all the territories of Israel,
2 Kings 10:33 including all the land beyond the Jordan River—Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh—from Aroer, which is by the Arnon Valley, including Gilead and Bashan.
2 Kings 10:34 Now, the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he accomplished, and all his might, are these not recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 10:35 Then Jehu rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz succeeded him as king.
2 Kings 10:36 The length of Jehu's reign over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2 Kings 10:37 [Verse not found in Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings 10]
2 Kings 10:38 [Verse not found in Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings 10]
2 Kings 10:39 [Verse not found in Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings 10]
2 Kings 10:40 [Verse not found in Clementine Vulgate for 2 Kings 10]
2 Kings 10:1 Now, Ahab had seventy sons living in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them into Samaria, to the city's most important officials, to its elders, and to those who had cared for Ahab's children since their youth, saying this:
2 Kings 10:2 “As soon as you receive this letter—you who are responsible for your lord's sons, who have chariots and horses, who control fortified cities and weapons—
2 Kings 10:3 choose the best and most capable among your lord's sons. Then put him on his father's throne and fight for the dynasty of your lord.”
2 Kings 10:4 But they were terrified and said, “Look, two kings couldn't stand against him—referring to Jehu—so how can we possibly resist Jehu ourselves?”
2 Kings 10:5 So the official in charge of the palace, along with the city's chief officials, the elders, and the guardians of Ahab's sons, sent this message back to Jehu: “We are your servants. Whatever you command, we will do. We will not set up anyone as king. You may do whatever you think is right.”
2 Kings 10:6 Jehu then wrote a second letter to them, saying: “If you truly are loyal to me and are ready to obey me, then take the heads of your lord's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” Now, the king's seventy sons were living with the most important officials of the city, who were raising them.
2 Kings 10:7 When the officials received Jehu's letter, they seized the king's seventy sons and slaughtered every one of them. Then they put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
2 Kings 10:8 When a messenger came and reported to Jehu, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king's sons,” Jehu replied, “Pile them in two heaps by the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning.”
2 Kings 10:9 In the morning, Jehu went out, stood before all the people, and declared: “Understand this now: None of you are guilty of this conspiracy to kill Joram, the son of Ahab; however, know that nothing of all the Lord's words spoken against the dynasty of Ahab has failed to come to pass. The Lord has truly done what he promised through his servant Elijah.”
2 Kings 10:10 So then Jehu struck down all those who remained of Ahab's dynasty in Jezreel, along with all of Ahab's chief officials, his close associates, and his priests, until not a single person remained from his family line.
2 Kings 10:11 Then Jehu got up and traveled to Samaria. On the way, when he reached a shepherd's hut,
2 Kings 10:12 he found the relatives of Ahaziah, king of Judah. He asked them, “Who are you?” They answered, “We are the relatives of King Ahaziah, and we are on our way to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen.”
2 Kings 10:13 Jehu ordered, “Seize them alive!” And when they had seized them alive, he had them slaughtered by the roadside well—all forty-two men. He did not leave a single one of them alive.
2 Kings 10:14 When Jehu left that place, he met Jehonadab son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, “Is your heart as true to me as my heart is to yours?” Jehonadab answered, “It is.” Jehu then said, “If it is, give me your hand.” So Jehonadab gave him his hand, and Jehu pulled him up into his chariot with him.
2 Kings 10:15 Then Jehu said to him, “Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.” And he took Jehonadab into his chariot.
2 Kings 10:16 When Jehu arrived in Samaria, he struck down everyone who remained from Ahab's dynasty in Samaria, until he had completely annihilated them. This was in accordance with the word of the Lord that he had spoken to Elijah.
2 Kings 10:17 Then Jehu gathered all the people and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, but I will serve him much more.”
2 Kings 10:18 “Therefore, summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests to me now. Let no one fail to come, for I am offering a great sacrifice to Baal. Anyone who is absent will not live.” Jehu was doing this with a cunning plan in mind, intending to utterly destroy the worshippers of Baal.
2 Kings 10:19 And Jehu said, “Consecrate a solemn assembly for Baal!” So they proclaimed it.
2 Kings 10:20 Jehu sent messengers throughout all Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one remained who did not come. They entered the temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
2 Kings 10:21 Then Jehu said to the attendant who was in charge of the robes, “Bring out vestments for all the worshippers of Baal.” So he brought out vestments for them.
2 Kings 10:22 Jehu, along with Jehonadab son of Rechab, entered the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the worshippers of Baal, “Search carefully and make sure there is no servant of the Lord among you, but only worshippers of Baal.”
2 Kings 10:23 Then they proceeded to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now, Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, saying to them, “If any of these men whom I bring into your hands escape, then the life of that guard will pay for the life of the one who escaped.”
2 Kings 10:24 As soon as the burnt offering was completed, Jehu commanded his guards and officers, “Go in and strike them down! Let no one escape!” So the guards and officers struck them down with the edge of the sword. They threw their bodies out and went into the inner sanctuary of the temple of Baal.
2 Kings 10:25 They brought out the sacred pillar, or idol, from the temple of Baal and burned it.
2 Kings 10:26 They then broke down the sacred pillar of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal itself. They turned it into a latrine, which it remains to this very day.
2 Kings 10:27 Thus, Jehu eradicated Baal worship from Israel.
2 Kings 10:28 Nevertheless, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin—namely, the worship of the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.
2 Kings 10:29 Therefore, the Lord said to Jehu, “Because you have zealously carried out what was right in my sight, and have accomplished all that was in my heart concerning the dynasty of Ahab, your sons will sit on the throne of Israel for four generations.”
2 Kings 10:30 However, Jehu himself did not carefully walk in the Law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. For he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, who caused Israel to sin.
2 Kings 10:31 In those days, the Lord began to cut off parts of Israel. King Hazael of Aram struck them throughout all the territory of Israel,
2 Kings 10:32 starting from the Jordan River eastward, encompassing all the land of Gilead—the territories of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh—from Aroer, which is by the Arnon Valley, including Gilead and Bashan.
2 Kings 10:33 Now, the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 10:34 So Jehu rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. Then his son Jehoahaz became king in his place.
2 Kings 10:35 Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-eight years.
2 Kings 10:36 As for the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 10:37 Jehoahaz rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. Then his son Joash became king in his place, during the seventeenth year of the reign of King Joash of Judah.
2 Kings 10:38 Amasias was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddin, from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 10:39 He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, though not with the complete devotion of his ancestor David. He followed the example of all that his father Joash had done.
2 Kings 10:40 However, he did not remove the high places—the pagan altars—so the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there. In those days, Amaziah sent messengers to King Joash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us meet face to face in battle.”
2 Kings 10:1 Now, Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them into Samaria to the chief men of the city, to the elders, and to those who had been responsible for raising Ahab’s children. This is what he said:
2 Kings 10:2 "As soon as you receive these letters—you who have the sons of your lord, and chariots, and horses, and cities, and weapons—choose the best and most pleasing of your lord’s sons. Then put him on his father’s throne and fight for your lord’s family."
2 Kings 10:3 But they were terrified, and they said: "Look, two kings were not able to stand against him, so how can we resist?"
2 Kings 10:4 Therefore, Jehu had already sent people to take charge of the household and the sons of Ahab. Indeed, Jehu himself had already killed all the chief men, all the elders, and those who had been responsible for raising Ahab’s children in Samaria.
2 Kings 10:5 But then Jehu sent a second set of letters to them, saying: "If you are with me and obey me, then take the heads of Ahab’s sons and come to me tomorrow at this time in Jezreel." (The king’s seventy sons were living with the chief men of the city, who were raising them.)
2 Kings 10:6 When these letters reached them, they seized the king’s sons and killed all seventy men. Then they put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
2 Kings 10:7 A messenger came and reported to Jehu, saying: "They have brought the heads of the king’s sons." Jehu replied: "Make them into two piles at the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning."
2 Kings 10:8 When morning came, Jehu went out and stood on the steps near the city gate. He said to all the people there: "You yourselves are innocent in this matter. Look, I conspired against my lord and killed him. But who then murdered all of these men?"
2 Kings 10:9 "Understand now that not one word spoken by the Lord against Ahab’s house has fallen to the ground without being fulfilled. The Lord has done what He spoke through His servant Elijah."
2 Kings 10:10 So Jehu then killed all those who remained of Ahab’s family in Jezreel—all of his chief men, his close acquaintances, and his priests—until he left not a single one alive.
2 Kings 10:11 And Jehu rose up and left, going toward Samaria. When he came to the shepherd’s house on the road,
2 Kings 10:12 He found the relatives of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, there and asked them: "Who are you?" They replied: "We are Ahaziah’s relatives, and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen."
2 Kings 10:13 Jehu said: "Capture them alive!" So, when they had captured them alive, they slaughtered them—forty-two men—by the well near the house. Not a single one of them was left alive.
2 Kings 10:14 When Jehu had gone from there, he met Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said to him: "Is your heart as true to mine as my heart is to yours?" Jehonadab replied: "It is true, indeed! If it is, then give me your hand." So Jehu gave him his hand, and Jehu lifted him up into his chariot.
2 Kings 10:15 And Jehu said to him: "Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord." So he had Jehonadab sit in his chariot with him.
2 Kings 10:16 When Jehu arrived in Samaria, he killed all who remained of Ahab’s family in Samaria, until not one was left. This was according to the word of the Lord which He had spoken to Elijah.
2 Kings 10:17 Then Jehu took a priest of Baal and said to them: "Summon all the servants of Baal for me—all of his priests and all of his prophets. No one is to be absent, for I am offering a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever fails to come will not live." Jehu was doing this cunningly, intending to destroy the worshippers of Baal.
2 Kings 10:18 And Jehu announced this throughout all Samaria.
2 Kings 10:19 And Jehu announced throughout all Israel, saying: "Consecrate a solemn day for Baal!" He proclaimed it, and all the servants of Baal gathered together. Not a single one remained who did not come.
2 Kings 10:20 And they entered the temple of Baal, and the temple of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
2 Kings 10:21 And Jehu said to those who were in charge of the vestments: "Bring out robes for all the servants of Baal." So they brought out the robes for them.
2 Kings 10:22 Then Jehu, along with Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, entered the temple of Baal. He said to the worshippers of Baal: "Search carefully and make sure that none of the Lord’s servants are among you, but only the servants of Baal."
2 Kings 10:23 And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. But Jehu had placed one hundred men outside, telling them: "Whoever allows any of the men whom I deliver into your hands to escape, his life will pay for that man’s life."
2 Kings 10:24 And it came to pass that when the offering of the burnt offering was completed, Jehu commanded his guards and his commanders: "Go in and strike them down! Let no one escape!" So they struck them down with the edge of the sword, threw out their bodies, and then went into the inner city of the temple of Baal.
2 Kings 10:25 And they brought out the statue from the temple of Baal and burned it.
2 Kings 10:26 And they smashed the statue of Baal into pieces and utterly destroyed its temple, turning it into latrines, right up to the present day.
2 Kings 10:27 So Jehu completely eradicated Baal worship from Israel.
2 Kings 10:28 Nevertheless, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. He did not abandon the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.
2 Kings 10:29 And the Lord said to Jehu: "Because you have diligently done what was right and pleasing in My eyes, and have carried out everything that was in My heart against the house of Ahab, your sons will sit upon the throne of Israel for four generations."
2 Kings 10:30 However, Jehu did not carefully observe walking in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart. For he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin.
2 Kings 10:31 In those days, the Lord began to be disgusted with Israel. He allowed Hazael to strike them in all the territories of Israel,
2 Kings 10:32 From the Jordan River eastward, he struck all the land of Gilead, and Gad, and Reuben, and Manasseh—from Aroer, which is by the torrent of Arnon, including Gilead, and Bashan.
2 Kings 10:33 Now, the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 10:34 So Jehu rested with his forefathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And his son Jehoahaz reigned in his place.
2 Kings 10:35 Now, the days that Jehu reigned over Israel were twenty-eight years in Samaria.
2 Kings 10:36 And Jehu rested with his forefathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And his son Jehoahaz reigned in his place.
2 Kings 11:1 Athalia, the mother of Ochozias, saw that her son was dead. She then rose up and ordered the killing of all the royal offspring.
2 Kings 11:2 However, Iosaba, daughter of King Ioram and sister of Ochozias, took Ioas, the son of Ochozias. She secretly removed him from among the king’s sons who were being slaughtered. She gave him to his nurse in the treasury chamber, and they hid him from Athalia to prevent his murder.
2 Kings 11:3 Ioas was hidden with her in the Temple of the Lord for six years. During this time, Athalia reigned over the land.
2 Kings 11:4 In the seventh year, Ioiada sent for the centurions and soldiers, bringing them to him in the Temple of the Lord. He made a solemn covenant with them, imposing an oath on them in the Temple of the Lord, and then revealed the king’s son to them.
2 Kings 11:5 He commanded them, saying: “This is the instruction you must follow: A third of you are to enter on the Sabbath and guard the royal palace.”
2 Kings 11:6 “A third of you will stand guard at the Sur Gate. And a third of you will be at the gate beyond the armor-bearers’ chariots. You are to maintain watch over the palace and prevent any attack.”
2 Kings 11:7 “The other two parts of your company, all those whose Sabbath shift is ending, are to guard the Temple of the Lord around the king.”
2 Kings 11:8 “You are to surround him, with your weapons in your hands. If anyone enters the Temple precincts without permission, they are to be killed. You will be with the king both when he enters and when he leaves.”
2 Kings 11:9 The centurions carried out all that Ioiada the priest had commanded them. Each one gathered his men—those whose Sabbath shift was beginning and those whose shift was ending—and they came to Ioiada the priest.
2 Kings 11:10 The priest then gave them the weapons and shields of King David, which had been stored in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:11 Each man stood with his weapons in hand, forming a line from the right side of the Temple to the left side of the altar and the Temple itself, surrounding the king.
2 Kings 11:12 Ioiada brought out the king’s son and placed the royal crown upon him, along with a copy of the Law to signify his covenant with God. They made him king and anointed him. Then, clapping their hands, they shouted: “Long live the king!”
2 Kings 11:13 Athalia, meanwhile, heard the sound of the people running and praising the new king. She went to the people in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:14 She saw the king standing on the royal platform, as was customary, with the singers and trumpeters near him, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. She tore her garments and cried out: “Conspiracy! Conspiracy!”
2 Kings 11:15 But Ioiada the priest commanded the centurions and those in charge of the army, saying: “Lead her outside the Temple precincts. Anyone who follows her is to be killed by the sword.” The priest had given this order because he said: “She must not be killed in the Temple of the Lord.”
2 Kings 11:16 So they seized her, and when she reached the path of the Horse Gate, near the royal palace, they killed her there.
2 Kings 11:17 Ioiada then made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people, establishing that they would be the Lord’s people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people, defining their mutual obligations.
2 Kings 11:18 All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and destroyed it. They utterly shattered its altars and idols. They also killed Mathan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. Then the priest stationed guards in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:19 He then took the centurions, the Carians, the royal guards, and all the people of the land. They led the king from the Temple of the Lord and entered the palace through the Gate of the Guards. Ioas then took his seat on the royal throne.
2 Kings 11:20 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city became peaceful. Athalia had been killed by the sword at the royal palace.
2 Kings 11:21 Ioas was seven years old when he began to reign.
2 Kings 11:22 In the seventh year of Iehu’s reign, Ioas began to reign. He reigned for forty years in Ierusalem. His mother’s name was Sebia, from Bersabee.
2 Kings 11:23 Ioas did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the days that Ioiada the priest guided him.
2 Kings 11:24 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people still continued to sacrifice and burn incense there.
2 Kings 11:25 Ioas said to the priests: “All the consecrated money that is brought to the Temple of the Lord by passersby—including money offered as atonement for a soul or dedicated by a personal vow, and whatever money people freely and willingly bring to the Temple of the Lord—
2 Kings 11:26 let each priest receive it from his designated collectors, and with it, let them repair the deterioration of the Temple whenever they find anything broken or in disrepair.”
2 Kings 11:27 But by the twenty-third year of King Ioas, the priests still had not repaired the deterioration of the Temple.
2 Kings 11:28 So King Ioas summoned Ioiada the high priest and the other priests, saying to them: “Why have you not repaired the deterioration of the Temple? From now on, you are not to receive money from your collectors, but instead, you must hand it over directly for the Temple’s restoration.”
2 Kings 11:29 Thus, the priests were forbidden from then on to receive money from the people and from overseeing the repair of the Temple’s deterioration themselves.
2 Kings 11:30 Ioiada the high priest took a single chest, cut a hole in its lid, and placed it beside the altar, on the right side of those entering the Temple of the Lord. The priests who guarded the doors would put all the money brought to the Temple of the Lord into it.
2 Kings 11:31 Whenever they saw that the chest was full, the king’s scribe and the high priest would go up. They would empty it and count the money that had been collected in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:32 They would then give the money, according to its counted sum and measure, into the hands of those overseeing the work, and to the carpenters, builders, and stonemasons who were to repair the Temple’s deterioration.
2 Kings 11:33 It was also given to those who bought wood and cut stones to repair the damage to the Temple of the Lord, and for all other expenses required for the work of restoring the Temple.
2 Kings 11:34 Nevertheless, silver bowls, pitchers, cups, trumpets, or any gold and silver vessels were not made in the Temple of the Lord from the money that was brought in.
2 Kings 11:35 Instead, the money was given solely to those performing the work, so that they could use it to repair the deterioration of the Temple.
2 Kings 11:36 No accounting was required from the men who were given the money to distribute to the workmen and carpenters, because they acted with complete trustworthiness.
2 Kings 11:37 However, the money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not put into the Temple treasury; it belonged to the priests.
2 Kings 11:38 At that time, Azahel, the king of Syria, advanced and fought against Geth, capturing it. He then turned his attention towards Ierusalem, intending to attack it.
2 Kings 11:39 For this reason, Ioas, king of Iuda, took all the consecrated items that Iosaphat, Ioram, and Ochozias—his ancestors and kings of Iuda—had dedicated, along with his own offerings. He also took all the silver that could be found in the treasury of the Temple of the Lord and in the royal treasury. He sent all this to King Azahel of Syria, who then turned away from Ierusalem.
2 Kings 11:40 The rest of the acts of Ioas, and all that he did, are they not indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iuda?
2 Kings 11:1 When Athalia, the mother of Ochozias, saw that her son was dead, she rose up and killed all the royal offspring.
2 Kings 11:2 However, Josaba—daughter of King Joram and sister of Ochozias—took Joas, the son of Ochozias, and secretly rescued him from among the other royal children who were being murdered. She hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, away from Athalia, and so he was not killed.
2 Kings 11:3 So Joas was hidden with her in the Lord's Temple for six years, while Athalia reigned over the land.
2 Kings 11:4 But in the seventh year, Joiada sent for the centurions and soldiers and brought them to him in the Lord's Temple. There he made a covenant with them, and after administering an oath in the Lord's Temple, he showed them the king's son.
2 Kings 11:5 And he commanded them, saying, 'This is what you shall do: a third of you will come on the Sabbath and guard the king's palace.'
2 Kings 11:6 Another third will guard the Sur Gate. And the final third will guard the inner gate, where the shield-bearers usually run their course. You will take turns guarding the Temple complex.
2 Kings 11:7 And two other groups of you, all who typically go off duty on the Sabbath, are to guard the Lord's Temple around the king.
2 Kings 11:8 Surround the king, with each man having his weapons in hand. Anyone who tries to break through your ranks is to be killed. You are to stay with the king both when he enters and when he exits.
2 Kings 11:9 So the centurions did everything that Joiada the high priest had commanded them. Each centurion gathered his men, both those whose shift was beginning on the Sabbath and those whose shift was ending, and they came to Joiada the high priest.
2 Kings 11:10 Then the high priest gave them the spears and the weapons of King David that were stored in the Lord's Temple.
2 Kings 11:11 Then each man, with weapons in hand, took his position around the king, from the right side of the Temple all the way to the left side, encompassing both the altar and the Temple itself.
2 Kings 11:12 Then Joiada brought out the king's son and placed the royal crown upon him, along with the Testimony (the law of the covenant). They proclaimed him king and anointed him. Then, clapping their hands, they all shouted, 'Long live the King!'
2 Kings 11:13 When Athalia heard the shouts of the people running about, she came to the people in the Lord's Temple.
2 Kings 11:14 She saw the new king standing on the platform according to custom, with the singers and trumpeters beside him. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So she tore her clothes and cried out, 'Treason! Treason!'
2 Kings 11:15 Joiada then commanded the centurions who were in charge of the army, saying, 'Bring her out beyond the Temple precincts, and anyone who follows her is to be killed with the sword.' For the high priest had declared, 'Let her not be killed in the Lord's Temple.'
2 Kings 11:16 So they seized her and led her out through the entrance for horses, next to the palace, and there she was put to death.
2 Kings 11:17 Then Joiada made a covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people, establishing them as the Lord's own people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.
2 Kings 11:18 Then all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and utterly demolished it. They smashed its altars and images into tiny pieces. They also killed Mathan, the priest of Baal, right in front of the altars.
2 Kings 11:19 Joiada then appointed officers over the Lord's Temple, placing them under the authority of the priests and Levites, each performing his service in his assigned role within the Lord's house. This was to oversee the burnt offerings and peace offerings, according to the commandment of David, as it is written in the Book of Moses, and to perform these duties with joy and singing.
2 Kings 11:20 Then Joiada, accompanied by the centurions, the mighty men, the leaders of the people, and all the common people of the land, led the new king from the Lord's Temple. They entered the palace through the Horse Gate, and the king took his seat upon the royal throne.
2 Kings 11:21 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city finally found peace. Athalia had been killed by the sword at the king's palace.
2 Kings 11:1 Athaliah, who was the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead. So she rose up and killed all the royal offspring.
2 Kings 11:2 But Jehosheba, who was King Jehoram's daughter and Ahaziah's sister, took Ahaziah's son, Joash. She secretly took him from among the king's children who were being killed. She gave him to his nurse in a hidden bedroom, so that he would not be killed by Athaliah.
2 Kings 11:3 He remained hidden with her in the house of the Lord for six years. During this time, Athaliah reigned over the land as queen.
2 Kings 11:4 In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the centurions and the soldiers. He brought them to him in the Temple of the Lord. He made a covenant with them there and swore them to an oath in the Temple of the Lord. Then he showed them the king's son, Joash.
2 Kings 11:5 He commanded them, saying, "This is what you are to do: One-third of you, those who are entering on duty for the Sabbath, shall guard the royal palace."
2 Kings 11:6 "Another third of you shall be at the Sur Gate. And the final third shall be at the gate behind the guardhouse. You will all keep watch over the palace building."
2 Kings 11:7 "The other two divisions of you, all who are going off duty on the Sabbath, shall guard the Temple of the Lord around the king."
2 Kings 11:8 "You shall surround the king, with each man having his weapons in his hands. If anyone tries to enter the inner courts, he shall be killed. You are to remain with the king as he enters and leaves."
2 Kings 11:9 So the centurions did everything that Jehoiada the priest had commanded them. Each one took his men, those who were entering duty on the Sabbath, along with those who were going off duty from the Sabbath, and they came to Jehoiada the priest.
2 Kings 11:10 The priest then gave them spears and the weapons of King David, which were kept in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:11 The men stood, each with his weapons in his hands. They formed a line from the right side of the Temple to the left side, by the altar, the Temple itself, and all around the king.
2 Kings 11:12 Then Jehoiada brought out the king's son. He placed the royal crown on him and presented him with the testimony, which was the covenant scroll. They made him king and anointed him with oil. They clapped their hands and shouted, "Long live the king!"
2 Kings 11:13 When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she entered the Temple of the Lord where the people were.
2 Kings 11:14 She saw the king standing by the pillar, as was the custom, with the singers and trumpeters near him. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So she tore her clothes and cried out, "Treason! Treason!"
2 Kings 11:15 Jehoiada commanded the centurions who were in charge of the army. He told them, "Bring her out beyond the Temple courts. And whoever follows her, let him be killed by the sword." For the priest had said, "She must not be killed in the Temple of the Lord."
2 Kings 11:16 So they seized her. She went out through the Horse Gate, which was near the royal palace, and she was killed there.
2 Kings 11:17 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people, so that they would be the Lord's people. He also established a covenant between the king and the people.
2 Kings 11:18 All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and destroyed it. They smashed its altars and its idols into pieces, completely destroying them. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of his altar. Then the priest Jehoiada appointed guards over the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:19 Jehoiada took the centurions, the Carites (a foreign mercenary guard), the royal guards, and all the people of the land. They brought the king down from the Temple of the Lord. They entered the palace by way of the royal guard's gate, and he sat on the throne of the kings.
2 Kings 11:20 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet and at peace. Athaliah, however, had been killed by the sword in the royal palace.
2 Kings 11:21 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.
2 Kings 11:22 In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash became king. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah, from Beersheba.
2 Kings 11:23 Joash did what was right in the sight of the Lord all the days that Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings 11:24 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places—these were the local places of worship outside Jerusalem. The people still sacrificed and burned incense on these high places.
2 Kings 11:25 Joash said to the priests, "All the money that is brought into the Temple of the Lord for sacred purposes by those who pass through—the money paid for a person's life, and any money that people freely and willingly bring to the Temple of the Lord—"
2 Kings 11:26 "Let the priests receive it, each from his own district, and let them repair the damages of the Temple building wherever they find a breach or a gap."
2 Kings 11:27 However, by the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign, the priests had still not repaired the damages of the Temple.
2 Kings 11:28 So King Joash called for Jehoiada the chief priest and the other priests. He asked them, "Why are you not repairing the damages of the Temple? From now on, you shall not receive money from the people for yourselves. Instead, you must hand it over directly for the Temple repairs."
2 Kings 11:29 The priests were then forbidden to receive money from the people for their own use and were tasked only with repairing the breaches of the Temple.
2 Kings 11:30 Jehoiada the chief priest took one chest and bored a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one entered the Temple of the Lord. The priests who guarded the entrance would put into it all the money that was brought to the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:31 When they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the king's secretary and the chief priest would go up. They would empty it and count the money that was found in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:32 They would then give the counted money to the supervisors of the masons, the builders, and the stonecutters, who were restoring the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:33 They gave it to those who cut stones and to the quarrymen. It was also used to buy wood and cut stones, so that the entire Temple of the Lord could be restored wherever there were damages. This money was spent specifically for the restoration of the Temple.
2 Kings 11:34 However, no silver basins, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any other vessels of gold or silver were made for the Temple of the Lord from the money brought into the Temple.
2 Kings 11:35 Instead, that money was given to those who performed the work, so that they could use it to restore the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:36 No accounting was required from the men who received the money to distribute to the workmen and the laborers, because they were considered trustworthy.
2 Kings 11:37 The money from trespass offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the Temple of the Lord, because that money belonged to the priests.
2 Kings 11:38 At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, came up and fought against Gath and captured it. Then he set his sights on marching against Jerusalem.
2 Kings 11:39 Because of this threat, King Joash of Judah took all the sacred gifts that his fathers—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah—had consecrated. He also took his own consecrated gifts, and all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the Temple of the Lord and in the royal palace treasury. He sent all these to King Hazael of Syria. In exchange for these treasures, Hazael turned his army away from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 11:40 Now, as for the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 11:1 Athalia, the mother of Ahaziah, heard that her son was dead. She then rose up and ordered the killing of all who were of the royal lineage, to eliminate all potential heirs to the throne.
2 Kings 11:2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram and sister of Ahaziah, rescued Ahaziah's son, Joash, by secretly taking him from among the other royal children who were being murdered. She gave him to his nurse in a hidden room away from Athalia, and so he was not killed.
2 Kings 11:3 Joash remained hidden with her in the house of the Lord, the Temple, for six years, all while Athalia was ruling over the land.
2 Kings 11:4 Then, in the seventh year of Athalia's reign, Jehoiada the high priest sent for the captains of hundreds and the soldiers. He brought them to himself in the Temple of the Lord, made a solemn covenant with them, and after making them swear an oath in the Temple, he showed them the king’s son, Joash.
2 Kings 11:5 Jehoiada then commanded them, saying: “These are your instructions: a third of your men, those who are coming on duty for the Sabbath, shall go into the palace and guard the king’s residence.
2 Kings 11:6 Another third of you will stand guard at the Sur Gate, and the final third will be at the gate behind the guards' barracks. You must keep watch over the Temple to ensure it is not breached.”
2 Kings 11:7 “As for the other two parts of your men, all who are going off duty on the Sabbath, they shall guard the Lord's Temple and surround the king.
2 Kings 11:8 You shall form a protective circle around the king, with your weapons ready in your hands. If anyone attempts to enter your lines, they are to be killed. You are to remain with the king, protecting him whenever he enters or leaves.”
2 Kings 11:9 The captains of hundreds carried out all the orders given to them by Jehoiada the priest. Each officer took command of his incoming men, those who were starting their Sabbath duty, and his outgoing men, those who were finishing their Sabbath duty, and they all assembled before Jehoiada the priest.
2 Kings 11:10 Then Jehoiada the priest equipped them, giving them spears and the weapons of King David that had been kept in the Lord's Temple treasury.
2 Kings 11:11 Each man took his position with weapons in hand, forming a perimeter from the right side of the Temple all the way to the left side of the altar and the main Temple building, surrounding the king.
2 Kings 11:12 Then Jehoiada brought out the king's son, Joash, and placed the royal crown upon him. He also presented him with a copy of God’s Law, symbolizing his covenant with God and his duty to rule justly. They then proclaimed him king and anointed him with oil. The people clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!”
2 Kings 11:13 Athalia heard the noise of the people running and praising the new king. She went to where the people were, entering into the Lord's Temple.
2 Kings 11:14 There she saw the young king standing on the royal platform, as was the custom. The Temple singers were there, with trumpeters nearby, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and sounding their trumpets. Athalia tore her royal robes in distress and cried out, “Conspiracy! Treason!”
2 Kings 11:15 Jehoiada the priest then gave orders to the captains of the army: “Lead her out from the Temple grounds, and anyone who follows her is to be killed by the sword.” The priest had given this instruction because he did not want her to be put to death in the sacred house of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:16 So they seized her and led her out through the Horse Gate, which led to the royal palace, and there she was executed.
2 Kings 11:17 So Jehoiada formally established a covenant between the Lord, the new king, and the people, confirming that the nation would again wholeheartedly belong to the Lord.
2 Kings 11:18 Then all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and utterly destroyed it, along with its altars and idols, which they thoroughly smashed. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, right in front of his altars. Jehoiada the priest then placed guards over the Lord's Temple.
2 Kings 11:19 Jehoiada then led the captains, the Carite guards, the royal footmen, and all the people of the land, bringing the king from the Temple of the Lord. They entered the palace through the main guard gate, and Joash then sat upon the royal throne, taking his rightful place as king.
2 Kings 11:20 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city finally found peace and quiet. Athalia had been put to death by the sword near the king's palace, ending her reign of terror.
2 Kings 11:21 Joash was seven years old when he began his reign as king.
2 Kings 12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joas began to reign as king. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem, the capital city. His mother's name was Sebia, and she was from the city of Bersabee.
2 Kings 12:2 And Joas did what was right in the sight of the Lord during all the days that Jojada the high priest instructed and guided him.
2 Kings 12:3 Nevertheless, King Joas did not tear down the high places of worship outside of Jerusalem, so the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense in these unauthorized shrines.
2 Kings 12:4 King Joas then said to the priests: "Collect all the money from the holy offerings that is brought into the Lord's Temple. This includes money from visitors, from those who pay the redemption tax for their lives, and whatever people willingly and freely bring to the Lord's Temple from their hearts."
2 Kings 12:5 "The priests are to receive this money, each from his own assigned collection point. Then they are to use it to repair any damage they find in the Temple structure, wherever they see a need for restoration."
2 Kings 12:6 However, up to the twenty-third year of King Joas's reign, the priests still had not completed the repairs on the Temple structure.
2 Kings 12:7 So King Joas called for Jojada the high priest and the other priests and demanded of them: "Why have you not repaired the damages of the Temple? From now on, you are not to keep this money for yourselves. Instead, you must give it directly for the repairs of the Temple."
2 Kings 12:8 Therefore, the priests were forbidden from accepting money from the people for their own use, and they were also no longer solely responsible for directing the repairs of the Temple.
2 Kings 12:9 Then Jojada the high priest took a single chest and drilled a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, to the right of those entering the Lord's Temple. And the priests who guarded the entrance deposited all the money that was brought to the Lord's Temple directly into this chest.
2 Kings 12:10 Whenever the Temple officials saw that a large amount of money had accumulated in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest would go up. They would empty the chest and count the money that had been collected for the Lord's Temple.
2 Kings 12:11 They then gave the counted money directly into the hands of those who supervised the work, and to the carpenters and the masons they had hired, who were responsible for repairing the Temple.
2 Kings 12:12 They also paid the timber merchants and stonecutters for purchasing stone and timber, and for all other expenses related to restoring the damages of the Temple.
2 Kings 12:13 Nevertheless, out of the money brought into the Lord's Temple, no silver basins, tongs, bowls, trumpets, or any other vessels of gold or silver were made for use in the Temple rituals.
2 Kings 12:14 Instead, the money was given only to those who were doing the work, so that they could use it to repair the damages of the Temple.
2 Kings 12:15 They did not require an accounting from the men who received the money to pay the workers, because they entrusted it to them in good faith.
2 Kings 12:16 However, the money from sin offerings and guilt offerings was not brought into the Lord's Temple chest, because that money belonged to the priests for their sustenance.
2 Kings 12:17 At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, marched up and fought against the city of Geth and captured it. Then he set his sights on marching up against Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12:18 Because of this threat, Joas, the king of Judah, took all the sacred gifts that his fathers, the kings of Judah—Josaphat, Joram, and Ochozias—had dedicated to the Lord, along with his own offerings, and all the gold that could be found in the treasuries of the Lord's Temple and in the king's palace. He sent all of this as a tribute to Hazael, the king of Syria, and Hazael then turned away from attacking Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12:19 Are not the rest of the deeds of Joas, and all that he accomplished, recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 12:20 However, his own servants rose up and conspired against him. They struck down Joas in the house of Mello, which is on the road that goes down to Sella.
2 Kings 12:21 Josachar, the son of Semaath, and Jozabad, the son of Somer, his own servants, struck him down, and he died. They buried him with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Amasias then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash became king. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah, from Beersheba.
2 Kings 12:2 Joash did what was right in the sight of the Lord throughout all the days that Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings 12:3 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places. The people continued to sacrifice and burn incense there.
2 Kings 12:4 Joash said to the priests: "All the money that is brought into the temple of the Lord from those who pass through—money consecrated to God, that is given as a vow, or that anyone willingly offers—and brought into the temple of the Lord:"
2 Kings 12:5 "Let the priests receive it according to their assigned duty, and let them repair the damages of the temple, wherever they find anything broken."
2 Kings 12:6 But up until the twenty-third year of King Joash, the priests had not repaired the damages of the temple.
2 Kings 12:7 So King Joash called Jehoiada the high priest and the other priests, saying to them: "Why have you not repaired the damages of the temple? Therefore, do not receive any more money according to your assigned duty, but give it for the repair of the temple."
2 Kings 12:8 And the priests were forbidden from receiving any more money from the people or repairing the damages of the temple themselves.
2 Kings 12:9 Then Jehoiada the high priest took a single chest and drilled a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side of those entering the House of the Lord. And the priests who guarded the entrances deposited all the money that was brought to the temple of the Lord into it.
2 Kings 12:10 Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest would go up to it, empty it out, and count the money that was found in the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 12:11 Then they would give it, carefully counted and measured, into the hands of those who supervised the builders of the House of the Lord. These supervisors, in turn, spent it on the masons and the carpenters who worked on the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 12:12 They also spent it on those who repaired the cracks, and on purchasing stones and timbers to fully restore the damages of the temple of the Lord, whatever needed repair.
2 Kings 12:13 However, no silver basins, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any gold or silver vessels were made from that particular money that was brought into the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 12:14 Instead, that money was given to those who performed the work, so that they could repair the damages of the temple of the Lord with it.
2 Kings 12:15 And no accounting was required from the men who received the money to distribute it to the builders, because they acted with integrity.
2 Kings 12:16 However, money from trespass offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the temple of the Lord, but belonged to the priests.
2 Kings 12:17 At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, came up and fought against Gath and captured it. Then he set his sights on marching up against Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12:18 For this reason, Joash, the king of Judah, took all the sacred gifts that his fathers, King Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, had consecrated, along with what he himself had offered. He also took all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the temple of the Lord and in the king's treasuries, and he sent it to Hazael, the king of Syria. As a result, Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12:19 As for the rest of the deeds of Joash, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 12:20 But his servants conspired against him and struck him down in the House of Millo, on the road down to Silla.
2 Kings 12:21 Indeed, Jozachar, the son of Shimeath, and Jozabad, the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died. They buried him with his fathers in the City of David, and his son Amaziah reigned in his place.

2 Kings 12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah, and she was from Beersheba.
2 Kings 12:2 King Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all the days that Jehoiada the High Priest guided and taught him.
2 Kings 12:3 Nevertheless, the king did not remove the high places of worship. The people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense in these high places.
2 Kings 12:4 King Joash then spoke to the priests: "All the consecrated funds that are brought into the Temple of the Lord by those who pass through, and the money offered as a redemption for a soul, and whatever people willingly and freely bring into the Temple of the Lord, out of their own free will—"
2 Kings 12:5 "...—the priests are to receive these funds according to their assigned duties, and they must use them to repair the structural damage of the Temple, specifically anything they find that is broken or dilapidated."
2 Kings 12:6 However, up until the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign, the priests had not yet repaired the structural damage of the Temple.
2 Kings 12:7 So King Joash called for Jehoiada the High Priest and the other priests, asking them: "Why are you not repairing the damage to the Temple? From now on, you are not to personally receive the money, but instead, you must hand it over specifically for the purpose of repairing and restoring the Temple's damage."
2 Kings 12:8 Therefore, the priests were forbidden from then on to collect money directly from the people for themselves, or to manage the repairs of the Temple on their own.
2 Kings 12:9 So Jehoiada the High Priest took one chest, drilled a hole in its lid, and placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the House of the Lord. The priests who guarded the entrance then put all the money that was brought into the Temple of the Lord into this chest.
2 Kings 12:10 When they saw that a large amount of money had accumulated in the chest, the king's scribe and the High Priest would go up, empty out the chest, and count the money that was found in the House of the Lord.
2 Kings 12:11 They would then give the counted money to those who were in charge of the craftsmen, the skilled laborers, and the builders of the House of the Lord. These were the ones responsible for repairing the structural work of the Temple.
2 Kings 12:12 This money was given to the carpenters, the masons, and those who quarried stones. It was also used to purchase wood and cut stones from the quarries for repairing the structural work of the House of the Lord, and for all other materials needed for the Temple's restoration.
2 Kings 12:13 However, from the money that was brought into the Temple, no silver basins, tongs, bowls, trumpets, or any other golden or silver vessels were made for the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 12:14 Instead, the money was given to the workers so that they could use it to repair the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 12:15 And no accounting was required from the men who received the money to distribute it to the craftsmen and skilled laborers, for they acted with faithfulness and integrity.
2 Kings 12:16 However, money from trespass offerings and money from sin offerings was not brought into the Temple of the Lord, because these specific funds belonged to the priests as their rightful portion.
2 Kings 12:17 At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, attacked and fought against Gath, capturing it. He then set his sights on Jerusalem, preparing to conquer it next.
2 Kings 12:18 Because of this threat, King Joash of Judah took all the sacred gifts that his fathers—Kings Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah of Judah—had dedicated, along with his own offerings. He also took all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the House of the Lord and in the king's treasury. He sent all of this to King Hazael of Syria, and by doing so, he diverted the attack away from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12:19 Now, concerning the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he accomplished, are these not indeed written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 12:20 However, his own servants rose up and conspired against him, striking down King Joash at Beth Millo, on the road descending to Silla.
2 Kings 12:21 Indeed, his servants Jozachar, son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of Shomer, were the ones who struck him, and he died. They buried him with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Amaziah became king in his place.
2 Kings 12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu's reign, Joash became king. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah, and she was from Beersheba.
2 Kings 12:2 Joash did what was right in the sight of the Lord all the days that Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
2 Kings 12:3 However, he did not remove the high places of pagan worship. The people still continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense in these high places.
2 Kings 12:4 Joash then said to the priests: 'All the money offered as sacred gifts that is brought into the Temple of the Lord by those passing through, and from individual men, according to the assessed value of their souls, and all the money that is voluntarily and willingly brought into the Temple of the Lord—'
2 Kings 12:5 '—let the priests receive it according to their regular practice, and use it to repair the Temple's damage, wherever ruin is found.'
2 Kings 12:6 However, up to the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign, the priests had not yet repaired the Temple's damage.
2 Kings 12:7 So King Joash called for Jehoiada the high priest and the other priests, saying to them: 'Why have you not repaired the Temple's damage? From now on, you are not to receive money according to your regular portion, but you must give it for the restoration of the Temple.'
2 Kings 12:8 Consequently, the priests were forbidden from receiving any more money from the people for their own use, and they were instead charged with repairing the Temple.
2 Kings 12:9 Then Jehoiada the high priest took a single chest, cut a hole in its lid, and placed it beside the altar, to the right of those entering the Lord's house. The priests who guarded the doors would place all the money that was brought into the Lord's Temple into this chest.
2 Kings 12:10 Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of silver in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest would go up, empty it, and count the money that was found in the Lord's Temple.
2 Kings 12:11 They would then give the counted money to those who were in charge of the work, and to the carpenters and masons who were repairing the Lord's house,
2 Kings 12:12 and to those who cut stones, and to those who carried materials. This was also for buying timber and cut stones, and for performing all other repairs needed for the Lord's Temple.
2 Kings 12:13 However, no golden or silver ornaments, no bowls, no basins, no trumpets, nor any golden or silver vessels were made for the Lord's Temple from the money that was brought in.
2 Kings 12:14 Instead, the money was given to the workmen so that the Lord's Temple could be repaired with it.
2 Kings 12:15 The men who received the money to distribute to the workmen were not required to give an account for it, because they acted with integrity and trustworthiness.
2 Kings 12:16 But the money for guilt offerings and the money for sin offerings was not brought into the Lord's Temple, because that money belonged to the priests as their portion.
2 Kings 12:17 At that time, Hazael, the king of Syria, went up and fought against Gath and captured it. He then set his sights on marching against Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12:18 Because of this threat, Joash, the king of Judah, took all the sacred gifts that his fathers, King Jehoshaphat, King Jehoram, and King Ahaziah, had consecrated, along with his own offerings, and all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the Lord's Temple and in the king's palace. He sent all of this to Hazael, the king of Syria, and Hazael then turned away from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12:19 As for the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 12:20 However, his own servants rose up and formed a conspiracy among themselves. They struck down Joash in the house of Millo, which is on the way down to Silla.
2 Kings 12:21 Jozachar, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer, his own servants, struck him dead. He was buried with his forefathers in the city of David, and his son Amaziah became king in his place.

2 Kings 13:1 In the twenty-third year of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, who was king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, began to reign over Israel in Samaria. He reigned for sixteen years.
2 Kings 13:2 And he did evil in the sight of the Lord. He followed the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, and he did not turn away from those sins.
2 Kings 13:3 So the Lord was angry with Israel and delivered them into the power of Hazael, the king of Syria, and into the power of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, for all those days.
2 Kings 13:4 But Jehoahaz pleaded with the Lord, and the Lord heard him, for He saw the suffering of Israel because the king of Syria had greatly oppressed them.
2 Kings 13:5 And the Lord gave Israel a deliverer, and he freed them from the power of Syria, so the children of Israel lived in their own homes as they had before—in peace and security.
2 Kings 13:6 Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin, but they persisted in those sins. Moreover, the Asherah pole also remained standing in Samaria.
2 Kings 13:7 And the Lord had left to Jehoahaz no more of the people than fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like dust when threshing grain.
2 Kings 13:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his strength, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:9 So Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Joash, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, the king of Judah, Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for sixteen years.
2 Kings 13:11 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, but he persisted in them.
2 Kings 13:12 Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his strength, and how he fought against Amaziah, the king of Judah, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:13 So Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2 Kings 13:14 Now Elisha was suffering from the illness of which he was to die. And Joash, the king of Israel, went down to him and wept before him, saying, 'My father, my father! You are the very strength and defense of Israel!'
2 Kings 13:15 And Elisha said to him, 'Bring a bow and arrows.' So he brought a bow and arrows to him.
2 Kings 13:16 He then said to the king of Israel, 'Put your hand on the bow.' And when the king had put his hand on it, Elisha put his own hands over the king's hands.
2 Kings 13:17 And Elisha said, 'Open the eastern window.' And when he had opened it, Elisha said, 'Shoot the arrow!' And he shot it. Then Elisha said, 'This is the arrow of the Lord’s deliverance, the arrow of deliverance against Syria! You will strike down Syria at Aphek until you have utterly destroyed them!'
2 Kings 13:18 And again Elisha said, 'Take the arrows.' And when he had taken them, he said to the king of Israel, 'Strike the ground with the arrows.' And he struck the ground three times, and then he stopped.
2 Kings 13:19 And the man of God was angry with him and said, 'If you had struck the ground five or six or seven times, you would have struck down Syria until its complete destruction. But now you will strike Syria only three times!'
2 Kings 13:20 So Elisha died, and they buried him. Now, bands of Moabite raiders would invade the land in the spring of that year.
2 Kings 13:21 And as some men were burying a man, they saw the raiders and quickly threw the corpse into Elisha’s tomb. And when the corpse touched the bones of Elisha, the man was revived and stood up on his feet.
2 Kings 13:22 Now Hazael, the king of Syria, had oppressed Israel throughout all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings 13:23 But the Lord was merciful to them and turned to them because of His covenant which He had made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was unwilling to destroy them or utterly cast them from His presence, even to this present time.
2 Kings 13:24 So Hazael, the king of Syria, died, and Ben-Hadad, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 13:25 And Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, took back from the power of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, the cities which Hazael had taken from the power of Jehoahaz, his father, in battle. Joash defeated him three times and restored the cities to Israel.
2 Kings 13:1 In the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash, son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, began his seventeen-year reign over Israel in Samaria.
2 Kings 13:2 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He continued to commit the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. He did not turn away from those sins.
2 Kings 13:3 The Lord's anger burned hot against Israel. He handed them over to the power of Hazael, the king of Syria, and later to Ben-Hadad, Hazael’s son, for the entire reign of these kings.
2 Kings 13:4 Jehoahaz then pleaded before the Lord, and the Lord heard him, for the Lord saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria was crushing them.
2 Kings 13:5 And the Lord gave Israel a deliverer, and they were rescued from the power of the king of Syria. The Israelites then lived in their homes in peace, as they had in previous times.
2 Kings 13:6 However, they did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam's family line, who caused Israel to sin. Instead, they continued to practice those very sins. Moreover, the Asherah pole—a false idol—remained standing in Samaria.
2 Kings 13:7 Jehoahaz had almost no fighting force left from his army, except for fifty cavalrymen, ten chariots, and ten thousand infantrymen. This was because the king of Syria had decimated them, he had ground them down like dust on the threshing floor.
2 Kings 13:8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his strength—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:9 Jehoahaz rested in death with his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. His son Joash began to reign in his place.
2 Kings 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joash's reign over Judah, Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, began his sixteen-year reign over Israel in Samaria.
2 Kings 13:11 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, but he continued to practice those very sins.
2 Kings 13:12 Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his strength, including how he fought against Amaziah, the king of Judah—are these not recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:13 Joash rested in death with his ancestors, and Jeroboam then took his place on the throne. Moreover, Joash was buried in Samaria, among the kings of Israel.
2 Kings 13:14 Now Elisha was suffering from the illness that would ultimately cause his death. King Joash of Israel went to visit him and wept before him, crying out: "My father, my father! You are the very strength of Israel, its chariots and horsemen!"
2 Kings 13:15 Elisha said to him, "Bring a bow and arrows." And when the king had brought him a bow and arrows,
2 Kings 13:16 Elisha said to the king of Israel, "Place your hand on the bow." And when the king had placed his hand on the bow, Elisha placed his own hands over the king's hands.
2 Kings 13:17 Then Elisha said, "Open the window facing east." And the king opened it. Elisha told him, "Shoot." And he shot the arrow. Elisha declared: "This is the Lord's arrow of salvation, an arrow of victory against Syria! You will strike down Syria at Aphek until they are utterly defeated."
2 Kings 13:18 Then Elisha said, "Now pick up the arrows." And the king picked them up. Again, Elisha told him, "Strike the ground with them." So the king struck the ground three times, and then he stopped.
2 Kings 13:19 And the man of God became angry with him and said, "If you had struck the ground five or six times, you would have completely defeated Syria. But now, you will defeat Syria only three times."
2 Kings 13:20 So Elisha died, and he was buried. Now, every year, Moabite raiding parties would invade the land.
2 Kings 13:21 Once, as some men were burying a dead man, they suddenly saw a raiding party approaching and quickly threw the dead body into Elisha's tomb. As soon as the body touched Elisha's bones, the man was restored to life and stood up on his feet.
2 Kings 13:22 Throughout the entire reign of Jehoahaz, Hazael, the king of Syria, had oppressed Israel.
2 Kings 13:23 But the Lord had compassion on them and He turned back to them because of His covenant, which He had established with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was unwilling to destroy them or to utterly cast them away from His presence, right up to the present day.
2 Kings 13:24 Then Hazael, the king of Syria, died, and his son Ben-Hadad began to reign in his place.
2 Kings 13:25 Now Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, recaptured the cities that Ben-Hadad, son of Hazael, had taken from his father, Jehoahaz. Joash defeated Ben-Hadad three times and restored the cities of Israel to its control.
2 Kings 13:1 In the twenty-third year of Joas, son of Ochozia, the king of Judah, Joachaz, son of Jehu, began to reign over Israel in Samaria. He reigned for sixteen years.
2 Kings 13:2 He did evil in the Lord's presence. He continued the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nabat, who had led Israel into sin, and he never turned away from them.
2 Kings 13:3 The Lord's wrath burned against Israel, and He handed them over to Hazael, king of Syria, and to Hazael's son, Benadad, for many days.
2 Kings 13:4 However, Joachaz implored the Lord for help, and the Lord heard him, because He had seen the distress of Israel and how the king of Syria had afflicted them.
2 Kings 13:5 So the Lord provided Israel with a deliverer, and He freed them from the hand of the king of Syria. The people of Israel were released from Syrian control and were able to live in their homes peacefully again, just as they had before the war.
2 Kings 13:6 Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam's house—the ones who had led Israel into sin. Instead, they continued in them. Even the Asherah pole, dedicated to false gods, remained standing in Samaria.
2 Kings 13:7 For Joachaz, there were only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers left in his army. The king of Syria had destroyed all the rest, crushing them like dust under the threshing sledge.
2 Kings 13:8 Now, the rest of the history of Joachaz—all that he did, and how bravely he acted—is it not all written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:9 Joachaz died and was buried in Samaria. Then his son, Joas, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joas, the king of Judah, Joas, son of Joachaz, began to reign over Israel in Samaria. He reigned for sixteen years.
2 Kings 13:11 He also did evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nabat, who had led Israel into sin, but he continued to practice them.
2 Kings 13:12 Now, the rest of the history of Joas—all that he did, and his might in fighting against Amasias, the king of Judah—is it not all written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:13 Joas died, and Jeroboam, his son, sat on his throne. Joas was buried in Samaria, among the kings of Israel.
2 Kings 13:14 Now Eliseus became sick with the illness from which he would die. Joas, the king of Israel, went down to visit him and wept before him, saying, 'My father, my father! You are like the chariot and horsemen of Israel!'
2 Kings 13:15 Eliseus said to him, 'Bring a bow and arrows.' So the king brought him a bow and arrows.
2 Kings 13:16 Then Eliseus said to the king of Israel, 'Put your hand on the bow.' The king did so, and Eliseus placed his own hands over the king's hands.
2 Kings 13:17 Eliseus said, 'Open the window to the east.' When the king opened it, Eliseus commanded, 'Shoot the arrow!' The king shot the arrow. Then Eliseus declared, 'This is the Lord's arrow of salvation and deliverance against Syria! You will strike Syria at Aphec until you completely destroy them!'
2 Kings 13:18 Then Eliseus said, 'Take the arrows.' When the king had taken them, Eliseus said to him again, 'Strike the ground!' The king struck the ground three times and then stopped.
2 Kings 13:19 The man of God was angry with him and said, 'If you had struck five, six, or even seven times, you would have utterly destroyed Syria! But now, you will strike Syria only three times.'
2 Kings 13:20 So Eliseus died, and they buried him. In that same year, Moabite raiding parties invaded the land.
2 Kings 13:21 As some men were burying a dead body, they suddenly saw the Moabite raiding parties approaching. So, they quickly threw the corpse into Eliseus's tomb. When the body touched Eliseus's bones, the man came back to life and stood on his feet!
2 Kings 13:22 Throughout the entire reign of Joachaz, Hazael, the king of Syria, had oppressed Israel.
2 Kings 13:23 However, the Lord had compassion on them. He turned to them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He did not wish to destroy them or utterly cast them out from His presence, even to this very day.
2 Kings 13:24 Then Hazael, the king of Syria, died, and his son Benadad reigned in his place.
2 Kings 13:25 Furthermore, Joas, son of Joachaz, recaptured the cities from Benadad, son of Hazael—the very cities Benadad's father had seized from Joachaz, his own father, in battle. Joas defeated Benadad three times, thus restoring those cities to Israel.
2 Kings 13:1 In the twenty-third year of the reign of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, began his reign over Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for seventeen years.
2 Kings 13:2 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He followed the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had made Israel commit sin; Jehoahaz did not turn away from those sins.
2 Kings 13:3 Therefore, the Lord was angry with Israel. He handed them over to the power of Hazael, the king of Syria, and into the power of Ben-Hadad, Hazael's son, throughout those days.
2 Kings 13:4 But Jehoahaz pleaded before the Lord. And the Lord heard him, because He saw the distress of Israel; for the king of Syria had oppressed them.
2 Kings 13:5 So the Lord gave Israel a deliverer, and they were freed from the power of the king of Syria. Then the children of Israel were able to live in their homes, as they had in times past.
2 Kings 13:6 Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had made Israel commit sin; instead, they continued in them. Indeed, the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria.
2 Kings 13:7 For Jehoahaz, there remained no more of the army than fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers. This was because the king of Syria had destroyed everyone else, crushing them like dust under the threshing sledges.
2 Kings 13:8 Now, as for the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and everything he did, and his valiant deeds—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:9 So Jehoahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then his son Jehoash became king in his place.
2 Kings 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, king of Judah, Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for sixteen years.
2 Kings 13:11 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had made Israel commit sin, but walked in them.
2 Kings 13:12 Now, as for the rest of the acts of Jehoash, and everything he did, and his might in how he fought against Amaziah, king of Judah—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:13 So Jehoash rested with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2 Kings 13:14 Now Elisha became sick with the illness by which he eventually died. Then Jehoash, the king of Israel, went down to him and wept over him, saying: 'My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!'
2 Kings 13:15 Elisha then said to him, 'Bring a bow and arrows.' When Jehoash had brought him a bow and arrows,
2 Kings 13:16 Elisha said to the king of Israel, 'Place your hand upon the bow.' And Jehoash placed his hand upon it, and Elisha placed his hands over the king's hands.
2 Kings 13:17 And Elisha said, 'Open the window toward the east.' When Jehoash had opened it, Elisha said, 'Shoot the arrow!' And he shot it. Then Elisha declared, 'This is the arrow of the Lord's deliverance! It is the arrow of deliverance against Syria! For you will strike Syria in Aphek until you completely destroy them.'
2 Kings 13:18 And Elisha said, 'Take the arrows.' When Jehoash had taken them, Elisha again said to him, 'Strike the ground.' And he struck it three times, and then he stopped.
2 Kings 13:19 Then the man of God was angry with him and said, 'If you had struck five or six times, you would have struck Syria until their complete destruction. But now, you will strike Syria only three times.'
2 Kings 13:20 So Elisha died, and they buried him. And raiding parties from Moab invaded the land in that very year.
2 Kings 13:21 Now it happened that some men were burying a dead person when they saw the raiding parties. So they threw the corpse into Elisha's tomb. When the dead man touched Elisha's bones, he revived and stood up on his feet.
2 Kings 13:22 Indeed, throughout all the days of King Jehoahaz, Hazael, the king of Syria, had oppressed Israel.
2 Kings 13:23 But the Lord had mercy on them and turned back to them because of His covenant which He had made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He did not wish to destroy them, nor to cast them utterly away from His sight, even until the present day.
2 Kings 13:24 Then Hazael, the king of Syria, died, and his son Ben-Hadad reigned in his place.
2 Kings 13:25 Moreover, Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, then recovered the cities from the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael. These were the cities that Ben-Hadad had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz, Jehoash's father, by right of war, throughout all those days. Jehoash struck him three times, and so restored the cities to Israel.

2 Kings 14:1 In the second year of Joas, the son of Joachaz and King of Israel, Amasias, the son of Joas and King of Judah, began his reign.
2 Kings 14:2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Joadan, who was from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 14:3 Amasias did what was right in the sight of the Lord, however, he did not do it with the same wholeheartedness as David, his father. He followed all the ways that Joas, his father, had done before him.
2 Kings 14:4 Yet the high places of idolatry were not removed; the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense on those high places dedicated to false gods.
2 Kings 14:5 After he had established his royal authority and secured the kingdom in his own hands, Amasias struck down his servants who had assassinated Joas, his royal father.
2 Kings 14:6 But the sons of those assassins he did not put to death. He acted according to what is written in the book of the Law of Moses, as the Lord commanded, saying: 'Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; rather, each person shall die for their own sin alone.'
2 Kings 14:7 Amasias himself struck down Edom in the Valley of Salt, killing ten thousand men. He captured the city of Sela in battle, and he called its name Jecthel, which remains its name to this very day.
2 Kings 14:8 Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas, the son of Joachaz and grandson of Jehu, who was King of Israel. Amasias' message was: 'Come, let us look each other in the face,' meaning, 'Let us meet in battle.'
2 Kings 14:9 Joas, the King of Israel, sent this reply to Amasias, the King of Judah: 'The thistle in the field sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon, saying, "Give your daughter to my son to be his wife." But a wild beast passed by and trampled the thistle underfoot.'
2 Kings 14:10 Joas continued, 'You have indeed struck down and conquered Edom, and your heart has been lifted up in pride because of it. Rejoice in your victory, but stay in your own house and enjoy your triumph. Why do you provoke evil, so that you fall, and Judah with you?'
2 Kings 14:11 But Amasias did not listen to this warning. So Joas, the King of Israel, went up with his army. And he, along with Amasias, the King of Judah, met each other in battle at Beth Shemesh, a town in Judah.
2 Kings 14:12 Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man of Judah fled back to his own tent, abandoning the battle.
2 Kings 14:13 Joas, the King of Israel, captured Amasias, the King of Judah — the son of Joas, and grandson of Ochozias — at Beth Shemesh. Joas then brought Amasias as his prisoner to Jerusalem. There, Joas broke down the wall of Jerusalem, from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits — a significant humiliation and weakening of Judah's defenses.
2 Kings 14:14 Joas took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels he found in the house of the Lord and in the king's treasuries. He also took hostages, and then he returned to Samaria, the capital of Israel.
2 Kings 14:15 Now, the rest of the acts of Joas, and his military strength, and how he fought against Amasias, the King of Judah — are these not all written in the book of the chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:16 Joas then slept with his fathers — meaning he died — and was buried in Samaria with the other Kings of Israel. And his son, Jeroboam, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 14:17 Amasias, the son of Joas and King of Judah, lived for fifteen years after Joas, the son of Joachaz and King of Israel, had died.
2 Kings 14:18 Now, the rest of the acts of Amasias — are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 14:19 A conspiracy was made against Amasias in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish to escape, but he was killed there.
2 Kings 14:20 His body was then brought back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the City of David.
2 Kings 14:21 Then all the people of Judah took Azarias, who was sixteen years old, and they appointed him king in place of his father Amasias.
2 Kings 14:22 It was Azarias who rebuilt Ailath and restored it to Judah, after the king — his father — had died.
2 Kings 14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amasias, the son of Joas and King of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joas and King of Israel, began to reign in Samaria, and he reigned for forty-one years.
2 Kings 14:24 Jeroboam did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin and worship idols.
2 Kings 14:25 It was Jeroboam who restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the Lord, the God of Israel. This word was spoken through His servant Jonas, the son of Amathi, the prophet, who was from Gath-hepher.
2 Kings 14:26 For the Lord saw that the affliction of Israel was exceedingly bitter. He saw that they were utterly consumed and trapped, even those who remained, and there was no helper left for Israel.
2 Kings 14:27 The Lord had not yet declared that He would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky — meaning from existence. Instead, He saved them through the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joas.
2 Kings 14:28 Now, the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and everything he did, including his military strength, and how he fought, and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath for Judah within Israel — are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:29 Jeroboam then slept with his fathers — meaning he died — with the other Kings of Israel. And his son, Zacharias, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 14:30 In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam, the King of Israel, Azarias, the son of Amasias and King of Judah, began his reign.
2 Kings 14:31 He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jechelia, who was from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 14:32 Azarias did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, following all the ways that his father Amasias had done.
2 Kings 14:33 Yet, he did not remove the high places of idolatry; the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense on those high places dedicated to false gods.
2 Kings 14:34 But the Lord struck the king, and he became a leper until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house, isolated because of his illness. Joatham, the king's son, managed the palace and governed the people of the land in his father's stead.
2 Kings 14:35 Now, the rest of the acts of Azarias, and everything he did — are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 14:36 Azarias then slept with his fathers — meaning he died — and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. And his son, Joatham, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 14:37 In the second year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah and King of Israel, Joatham, the son of Ozias and King of Judah, began his reign.
2 Kings 14:38 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jerusa, the daughter of Sadoc.
2 Kings 14:39 Joatham did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, following all the ways that his father Ozias had done.
2 Kings 14:40 Yet, he did not remove the high places of idolatry; the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense on those high places dedicated to false gods. However, he himself built the upper gate of the house of the Lord.
2 Kings 14:1 In the second year of the reign of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, who was king of Israel, Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, began his reign.
2 Kings 14:2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan, from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 14:3 He did what was right in the sight of the Lord God. However, he did not do so perfectly, like his ancestor David. Instead, he did everything just as Joash, his father, had done.
2 Kings 14:4 Nevertheless, Amaziah did not remove the high places, which were unauthorized altars for worship. The people continued to sacrifice and burn incense in these high places.
2 Kings 14:5 After he had secured his royal power, he executed his own servants who had assassinated King Joash, his father.
2 Kings 14:6 But he did not put their children to death. He acted according to what is written in the book of the Law of Moses, as the Lord God had commanded, saying: "Fathers shall not be put to death for the sins of their children, nor shall children be put to death for the sins of their fathers. Rather, each person shall die for their own sin."
2 Kings 14:7 It was Amaziah himself who struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. He also captured the city of Sela in battle, and he named it Joktheel, a name it bears even to this present day.
2 Kings 14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, who was the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: "Come, let us confront each other in battle."
2 Kings 14:9 King Joash of Israel sent back a message to King Amaziah of Judah, saying: "The insignificant thistle of Lebanon sent a message to the mighty cedar of Lebanon, saying: 'Give your daughter as a wife to my son.' But then, wild beasts of the field came by and trampled the thistle. This is a warning that you are beneath me."
2 Kings 14:10 You have indeed struck down Edom and gained a victory, and your heart has become proud because of it. Be content with this glory, and stay in your own house. Why provoke such a disaster, that you should fall, and Judah with you?
2 Kings 14:11 But Amaziah would not listen to this warning. So King Joash of Israel went up against him. Both he and King Amaziah of Judah confronted each other at Beth Shemesh, a city in Judah.
2 Kings 14:12 And Judah was defeated before Israel. Every man then fled to his own tent, abandoning the battle.
2 Kings 14:13 King Joash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, the son of Joash, who was the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Joash then brought Amaziah back to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of Jerusalem, from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits.
2 Kings 14:14 He also took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the Temple of the Lord God, as well as in the king's treasuries. He also took hostages, and then returned to Samaria, the capital of his kingdom.
2 Kings 14:15 Now, the rest of the acts of Joash, and his military might, and how he fought against Amaziah, king of Judah—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:16 So Joash passed away and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam, his son, began to reign in his place.
2 Kings 14:17 Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
2 Kings 14:18 Now, the rest of the acts of Amaziah—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 14:19 After a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, Amaziah fled to Lachish. But they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
2 Kings 14:20 They brought his body back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the City of David.
2 Kings 14:21 Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. (He is also known as Uzziah.)
2 Kings 14:22 It was Azariah who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah, after King Amaziah passed away and was buried with his ancestors.
2 Kings 14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Joash, who was king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, began his reign in Samaria. He reigned for forty-one years.
2 Kings 14:24 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord God. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin by establishing idol worship.
2 Kings 14:25 It was Jeroboam who restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah (which is the Dead Sea). He did this according to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant Jonah, the prophet, the son of Amittai, who was from Gath Hepher.
2 Kings 14:26 For the Lord God saw the very bitter affliction of Israel. There was no one left, whether enslaved or free, and no one to help Israel.
2 Kings 14:27 And the Lord God had not said that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven. So He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joash.
2 Kings 14:28 Now, the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his military might, and how he fought, and how he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah within Israel—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:29 So Jeroboam passed away and was buried with the kings of Israel. And Zechariah, his son, began to reign in his place.
2 Kings 14:30 In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Azariah, the son of Amaziah, king of Judah, began his reign.
2 Kings 14:31 He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah, from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 14:32 And he did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord God, just as his father Amaziah had done in every way.
2 Kings 14:33 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places, which were unauthorized altars for worship. The people still continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
2 Kings 14:34 But the Lord God struck the king, and he remained a leper until the day of his death. Because of his leprosy, he had to live in a separate house, isolated from the people. And Jotham, the king's son, was in charge of the royal household and governed the people of the land.
2 Kings 14:35 Now, the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 14:36 So Azariah passed away and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Jotham, his son, began to reign in his place.
2 Kings 14:37 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah, king of Judah, Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel in Samaria for six months.
2 Kings 14:38 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord God, just as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin.
2 Kings 14:39 And Shallum, the son of Jabesh, conspired against him. Shallum struck him down in public, killed him, and then began to reign in his place.
2 Kings 14:40 Now, the rest of the acts of Zechariah—are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:1 In the second year of Joas, who was the son of Joachaz and king of Israel, Amasias, the son of Joas, began his reign as king over Judah.
2 Kings 14:2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Joadan, and she was from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 14:3 He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David, his great ancestor. He did everything just as his father Joas had done.
2 Kings 14:4 However, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people still continued to sacrifice and burn incense there.
2 Kings 14:5 When he had taken firm control of his kingdom, he executed the servants who had murdered Joas, his royal father.
2 Kings 14:6 But he did not put the children of those murderers to death, according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses—for the Lord had commanded this, saying: "Fathers shall not die for their children, nor shall children die for their fathers, but each one shall die for his own sin."
2 Kings 14:7 He himself struck down Edom in the Valley of Salt, ten thousand men; and he captured the city of Sela in battle, and he called its name Jectehel, which it is still called to this very day.
2 Kings 14:8 Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas, the son of Joachaz and grandson of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: "Come, let us look each other in the face"—meaning, "Let us fight in battle."
2 Kings 14:9 Joas, the king of Israel, sent back a reply to Amasias, king of Judah, saying: "The thistles of the field sent word to the cedars of Lebanon, saying: 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' But then, wild beasts of the field came by and trampled down the thistles."
2 Kings 14:10 "You have indeed struck down Edom and you have grown arrogant because of it. Be content with your victory and remain in your own house. Why provoke such evil against yourself, that both you and Judah should fall with you?"
2 Kings 14:11 But Amasias would not listen to the warning. So Joas, the king of Israel, went up against him, and Amasias, the king of Judah, also went forth; and they faced each other in Bethsames, a town in Judah.
2 Kings 14:12 Judah was defeated by Israel in the battle, and every man of Judah fled back to his own tent.
2 Kings 14:13 Joas, the king of Israel, captured Amasias, the king of Judah (who was the son of Joas, and grandson of Ochozias), at Bethsames, and brought him to Jerusalem. Then Joas tore down the wall of Jerusalem, from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, a length of four hundred cubits—which is about 600 feet.
2 Kings 14:14 He also took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that he found in the house of the Lord and in the king's treasuries, and he brought the hostages back with him to Samaria.
2 Kings 14:15 Now, the rest of the acts of Joas, and his strength, and how he fought against Amasias, the king of Judah—are these not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:16 So Joas slept with his fathers, and he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 14:17 Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joas, the son of Joachaz, king of Israel.
2 Kings 14:18 Now, the rest of the acts of Amasias—are these not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 14:19 And a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, so he fled to Lachis. But they sent men after him to Lachis, and they put him to death there.
2 Kings 14:20 And they brought his body back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the City of David.
2 Kings 14:21 Then all the people of Judah took Azarias, who was sixteen years old, and they made him king in place of his father Amasias.
2 Kings 14:22 It was he who built Ailath and restored it to Judah, after the king—his father—had slept with his fathers.
2 Kings 14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amasias, the son of Joas and king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joas, began to reign as king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for forty-one years.
2 Kings 14:24 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had made Israel to sin.
2 Kings 14:25 It was he who restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Emath as far as the Sea of the Desert, according to the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, which He spoke through His servant Jonas, the son of Amathi, the prophet, who was from Geth-opher.
2 Kings 14:26 For the Lord saw that the affliction of Israel was exceedingly bitter, and that they were utterly consumed and shut in, and there was no helper for Israel.
2 Kings 14:27 And the Lord had not said that He would blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens; rather, He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joas.
2 Kings 14:28 Now, the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his strength, how he fought, and how he restored Damascus and Emath to Judah in Israel—are these not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:29 So Jeroboam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel, and Zacharias, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 14:1 In the second year that Joas, the son of Joachaz, was king of Israel, Amasias, the son of Joas, began his reign as king of Judah.
2 Kings 14:2 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Joadan, and she was from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 14:3 He did what was right in the sight of the Lord; however, not in the same manner as his ancestor David. Amasias did everything that was to be done according to the ways of Joas his father.
2 Kings 14:4 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people continued to sacrifice and burn incense there.
2 Kings 14:5 As soon as he had firmly established his kingship, he executed the servants who had murdered his father, the king.
2 Kings 14:6 However, he did not put to death the children of the murderers. He acted according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, for the Lord had commanded, saying: 'Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; rather, each person shall die for their own sin.'
2 Kings 14:7 Amasias himself struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and he captured Petra—the city then called Sela—in battle. He then renamed it Jectheel, which it is still called to this very day.
2 Kings 14:8 Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas, the son of Joachaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: 'Come, let us meet face-to-face in battle!'
2 Kings 14:9 Joas, king of Israel, sent back this reply to Amasias, king of Judah: 'A lowly lily of the field once sent a message to the mighty cedar of Lebanon, saying: "Give your daughter to my son as a wife." But then, wild beasts of the field came by and trampled the lily underfoot.'
2 Kings 14:10 You have struck down Edom, and your heart has become arrogant because of it. Be content with your glory, and remain in your own palace! Why do you provoke this evil that will cause both you and Judah to fall with you?'
2 Kings 14:11 But Amasias would not yield. So Joas, king of Israel, went up with his forces, and he and Amasias, king of Judah, met face-to-face in Beth-shemesh of Judah for battle.
2 Kings 14:12 Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled home to his own dwelling.
2 Kings 14:13 Joas, king of Israel, captured Amasias, king of Judah—the son of Joas and grandson of Ochozias—in Beth-shemesh. He then brought Amasias to Jerusalem and demolished a section of Jerusalem's city wall, from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits.
2 Kings 14:14 Joas took all the gold and silver, along with all the vessels he found in the Temple of the Lord and in the royal treasuries. He also took hostages, and then he returned with all of it to Samaria.
2 Kings 14:15 As for the rest of the deeds of Joas, and all his might, and how he fought against Amasias, king of Judah—are these not all written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:16 Joas died and was buried in Samaria alongside the other kings of Israel. His son, Jeroboam, then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 14:17 Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joas, the son of Joachaz, king of Israel.
2 Kings 14:18 As for the rest of the deeds of Amasias, are these not all written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 14:19 When a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, Amasias fled to Lachish. But his enemies sent men after him to Lachish and murdered him there.
2 Kings 14:20 His body was brought back on horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his ancestors in the City of David.
2 Kings 14:21 Then all the people of Judah took Azarias, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amasias.
2 Kings 14:22 It was Azarias who rebuilt Ailath and restored it to Judah, after his father, the king, had died.
2 Kings 14:23 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joas, began his reign as king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for forty-one years.
2 Kings 14:24 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin.
2 Kings 14:25 It was Jeroboam who restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Hamath all the way to the Sea of the Arabah—the Dead Sea—just as the Lord, the God of Israel, had declared. This was spoken through His servant Jonas, the prophet, the son of Amathi, who was from Gath-hepher.
2 Kings 14:26 For the Lord had seen how very bitter was the affliction of Israel. They were utterly consumed, and there was no one left to help, neither bond nor free; no one to come to Israel's aid.
2 Kings 14:27 The Lord had not yet declared that He would blot out the name of Israel from the face of the earth. So, He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joas.
2 Kings 14:28 As for the rest of the deeds of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might—how he fought his battles, and how he restored Damascus and Hamath, previously held by Judah, back to Israel—are these not all written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:29 Jeroboam died and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Then his son Zacharias reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:1 In the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam's reign in Israel, Azariah, the son of King Amaziah of Judah, began his reign.
2 Kings 15:2 He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jechelia, who was from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 15:3 He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done in all things.
2 Kings 15:4 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people still continued to sacrifice and burn incense on these high places.
2 Kings 15:5 Therefore, the Lord struck the king with leprosy, and he remained a leper until the day of his death. He lived in a private house, set apart from others. Jotham, the king's son, managed the royal household and governed the people of the land.
2 Kings 15:6 All the other deeds of Azariah, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 15:7 Azariah died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Jotham then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:8 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel in Samaria for six months.
2 Kings 15:9 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his ancestors had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin.
2 Kings 15:10 Shallum, son of Jabesh, conspired against him. He struck Zechariah down in public, killing him, and then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:11 All the other deeds of Zechariah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:12 This fulfilled the word of the Lord which He had spoken to Jehu, saying, "Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel for four generations." And so it came to pass.
2 Kings 15:13 Shallum, son of Jabesh, began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah, king of Judah. He reigned for only one month in Samaria.
2 Kings 15:14 Then Menahem, son of Gadi, went up from Tirzah to Samaria. He struck down Shallum, son of Jabesh, in Samaria and killed him, then he reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:15 All the other deeds of Shallum, and the conspiracy he carried out, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:16 At that time, Menahem struck down Tappuah and everyone in it, and all its territory, starting from Tirzah, because they had not opened their gates to him. He killed all the pregnant women there and ripped them open.
2 Kings 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Menahem, son of Gadi, began his ten-year reign over Israel in Samaria.
2 Kings 15:18 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He never departed from the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin, throughout all his days.
2 Kings 15:19 Pul, the king of the Assyrians, came to the land. Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that Pul would help him and strengthen his reign.
2 Kings 15:20 Menahem exacted the money from the people of Israel, from all the powerful and wealthy men, demanding fifty shekels of silver from each, to give to the king of the Assyrians. So the king of Assyria turned back and did not remain in the land.
2 Kings 15:21 All the other deeds of Menahem, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:22 Menahem died and was buried with his ancestors. His son Pekahiah then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Pekahiah, son of Menahem, reigned over Israel in Samaria for two years.
2 Kings 15:24 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin.
2 Kings 15:25 However, Pekah, son of Remaliah, his captain, conspired against him. He had fifty men from the sons of the Gileadites with him. He struck Pekahiah down in Samaria, in the citadel of the royal palace, near Argob and Arieh. He killed him and then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:26 All the other deeds of Pekahiah, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:27 In the fifty-second year of Azariah's reign in Judah, Pekah, son of Remaliah, reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty years.
2 Kings 15:28 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had led Israel into sin.
2 Kings 15:29 In the days of Pekah, king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser, king of the Assyrians, came and captured Ijon, Abel-Beth-Maachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali. He deported the inhabitants of these places to Assyria.
2 Kings 15:30 Then Hoshea, son of Elah, conspired against Pekah, son of Remaliah, striking him down and killing him. He then reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham, son of Uzziah.
2 Kings 15:31 All the other deeds of Pekah, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:32 In the second year of Pekah's reign, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began his reign.
2 Kings 15:33 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha, daughter of Zadok.
2 Kings 15:34 He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Uzziah had done in all things.
2 Kings 15:35 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places of worship. The people still continued to sacrifice and burn incense on these high places. He himself built the upper gate of the house of the Lord.
2 Kings 15:36 All the other deeds of Jotham, and everything he accomplished, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 15:37 In those days, the Lord began to send Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, against Judah.
2 Kings 15:38 Jotham died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David, his father's city. His son Ahaz then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:1 In the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam's reign over Israel, Azariah, the son of King Amaziah of Judah, began to reign as king of Judah. —This Jeroboam was Jeroboam II, the son of Joash.
2 Kings 15:2 He was fifteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jechelia, from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 15:3 And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done in all things.
2 Kings 15:4 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places; for the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there. —These 'high places' were unauthorized sites of worship outside of the Temple in Jerusalem.
2 Kings 15:5 But the Lord struck the king with leprosy, and he remained a leper until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house, while Jotham, the king's son, governed the royal household and judged the people of the land.
2 Kings 15:6 Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 15:7 So Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. His son Jotham then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:8 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Zachariah, the son of Jeroboam (Jeroboam II), began to reign over Israel for six months.
2 Kings 15:9 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his royal ancestors had done. He did not turn away from the sins introduced by Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had led Israel into idolatry and false worship. —The 'sins of Jeroboam' refer to the worship of golden calves at Dan and Bethel.
2 Kings 15:10 But Shallum, the son of Jabesh, conspired against him. He struck him down openly, killing him, and then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:11 Now the rest of the acts of Zachariah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:12 This fulfilled the word of the Lord which He had spoken to Jehu, saying: 'Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel until the fourth generation.' And so it came to pass. —This prophecy was fulfilled with Zachariah, the fourth descendant of Jehu.
2 Kings 15:13 Shallum, the son of Jabesh, began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of King Azariah of Judah. He reigned for only one month in Samaria.
2 Kings 15:14 Then Menahem, the son of Gadi, went up from Tirzah to Samaria. He struck down Shallum, the son of Jabesh, in Samaria, killed him, and then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:15 Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the conspiracy by which he conspired, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:16 Then Menahem struck down Tiphsah, and all who were in it, and its territories from Tirzah, because they had not opened their gates to him. He killed all the pregnant women, ripping them open.
2 Kings 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Menahem, the son of Gadi, began to reign over Israel for ten years in Samaria.
2 Kings 15:18 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins introduced by Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin, throughout all his days.
2 Kings 15:19 Pul, the king of the Assyrians, came into the land of Israel. Menahem, in an act of submission, gave Pul a thousand talents of silver so that Pul would offer him military aid and strengthen his hold on the kingdom. —Pul is also known as Tiglath-Pileser III, a powerful Assyrian king.
2 Kings 15:20 Menahem then commanded all the wealthy men of Israel to give money to Pul, each man contributing five hundred shekels of silver, to secure the help of the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria returned to his own land and did not remain in Israel.
2 Kings 15:21 Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:22 So Menahem slept with his fathers. His son Pekahiah then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Pekahiah, the son of Menahem, began to reign over Israel in Samaria for two years.
2 Kings 15:24 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins introduced by Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin.
2 Kings 15:25 But Pekah, the son of Remaliah, his own captain, conspired against him. Pekah struck him down in Samaria, in the citadel of the royal palace, in the presence of Argob and Arie, along with fifty men from the Gileadites. Pekah killed him and then reigned in his place. —The 'citadel of the royal palace' refers to a fortified inner part of the king's residence.
2 Kings 15:26 Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:27 In the fifty-second year of Azariah's reign over Judah, Pekah, the son of Remaliah, began to reign over Israel in Samaria for twenty years.
2 Kings 15:28 And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn away from the sins introduced by Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who had caused Israel to sin.
2 Kings 15:29 In the days of Pekah, king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria, came and captured Ijon, Abel-Beth-Maachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali. He then deported their inhabitants to Assyria. —This Tiglath-Pileser is the same King Pul mentioned earlier, and this deportation was a common Assyrian tactic to suppress rebellion.
2 Kings 15:30 Then Hoshea, the son of Elah, conspired against Pekah, the son of Remaliah. He struck him down and killed him, and then reigned in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham, the son of Azariah.
2 Kings 15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:32 In the second year of Pekah's reign over Israel (Pekah, the son of Remaliah), Jotham, the son of King Azariah of Judah, began to reign as king of Judah.
2 Kings 15:33 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
2 Kings 15:34 And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Azariah had done in all things.
2 Kings 15:35 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places; for the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there. It was he who built the Upper Gate of the House of the Lord. —The 'high places' were unauthorized sites of worship outside of the Temple in Jerusalem.
2 Kings 15:36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 15:37 In those days, the Lord began to send against Judah King Rezin of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah. —Pekah was the reigning king of Israel at this time.
2 Kings 15:38 So Jotham slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the City of David, his father. His son Ahaz then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 16:1 In the seventeenth year of the reign of Pekah, son of Remaliah, Ahaz, son of Jotham, who was the King of Judah, began his reign.
2 Kings 16:2 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord his God, unlike his father David.
2 Kings 16:3 Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. Furthermore, he even made his son pass through fire, following the abominable customs of the nations whom the Lord had driven out before the children of Israel.
2 Kings 16:4 He also sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, and upon the hills, and under every leafy tree, engaging in idolatry.
2 Kings 16:5 Then Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to wage war. Although they besieged Ahaz, they could not capture him.
2 Kings 16:6 At that time, Rezin, the king of Syria, restored Elath to Syria, driving the Judeans out of Elath. And the Edomites came into Elath and settled there, where they remain even to this very day.
2 Kings 16:7 Then Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser, the king of the Assyrians, saying: "I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who have risen up against me."
2 Kings 16:8 Ahaz then took the silver and gold that could be found in the house of the Lord and in the royal treasuries, and he sent these as gifts to the king of the Assyrians.
2 Kings 16:9 The Assyrian king agreed to his request, for the king of the Assyrians went up to Damascus, devastated it, and deported its inhabitants to Cyrene. He also killed Rezin.
2 Kings 16:10 And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser, the king of the Assyrians. When King Ahaz saw the altar in Damascus, he sent its detailed plan and the exact likeness of all its workmanship to Urijah, the priest.
2 Kings 16:11 And Urijah, the priest, built an altar exactly according to all the instructions King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. Urijah the priest did this, completing it before King Ahaz returned from Damascus.
2 Kings 16:12 When the king returned from Damascus, he saw the altar, and he began to offer sacrifices and vows upon it.
2 Kings 16:13 He burned his burnt offering and his sacrifice, poured out his libations, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar.
2 Kings 16:14 Furthermore, the bronze altar that stood before the Lord, he moved it away from the front of the Temple, from its place between the altar and the Lord's Temple, and placed it on the side of this new, foreign altar.
2 Kings 16:15 King Ahaz also commanded Urijah the priest, saying: "Upon the larger, new altar, offer the morning burnt offering, the evening sacrifice, the king's burnt offering, and his sacrifice, along with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their sacrifices, and their libations. You shall pour all the blood of the burnt offerings and all the sacrifices upon it. As for the bronze altar, it shall be available for my personal discretion and use."
2 Kings 16:16 So Urijah, the priest, did according to all that King Ahaz had commanded.
2 Kings 16:17 King Ahaz also cut off the panels of the stands and removed the basins from them. He also took the great bronze Sea off the twelve oxen-shaped bases that were beneath it, removing it from its stands, and placed it upon a stone pavement.
2 Kings 16:18 The covered passageway for the Sabbath, which he had built in the Temple, and the outer entrance for the king, he removed these from the Temple of the Lord, doing so out of deference to the king of the Assyrians.
2 Kings 16:19 Now, the rest of the deeds of Ahaz, all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 16:20 Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Hezekiah, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, King Ahaz, the son of Jotham, began to reign over Judah.
2 Kings 16:2 Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king. He reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God, unlike his father David, who served God faithfully.
2 Kings 16:3 Instead, he followed the ways of the kings of Israel (who were unfaithful to God). He even sacrificed his own son by fire, according to the abominable practices of the pagan nations that the Lord had previously driven out from before the Israelites.
2 Kings 16:4 He also offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places (illicit altars), on the hills, and under every flourishing tree, worshipping pagan deities in these places.
2 Kings 16:5 At that time, King Rezin of Syria and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, King of Israel, marched up to Jerusalem to wage war. Although they besieged Ahaz, they were not able to overcome him.
2 Kings 16:6 At that same time, King Rezin of Syria restored Elath (also known as Eilat or Ailath) to Syria, driving the Jews out of Elath. The Edomites then came into Elath and settled there, where they remained even until the present day.
2 Kings 16:7 King Ahaz then sent messengers to King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria, declaring: "I am your servant and your son (meaning, I pledge loyalty and vassalage to you). Come up and rescue me from the power of the King of Syria and from the power of the King of Israel, who have risen up against me."
2 Kings 16:8 Ahaz then took all the silver and gold that could be found in the Temple of the Lord and in the royal treasuries, and he sent these valuables as tribute (or gifts) to the King of Assyria.
2 Kings 16:9 The King of Assyria agreed to Ahaz's request. He marched up to Damascus, conquered and devastated it, and deported its inhabitants to Kir (or Cyrene). He also put King Rezin to death.
2 Kings 16:10 King Ahaz then traveled to Damascus to meet King Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria. While there, Ahaz saw the altar in Damascus (which was likely a pagan, Assyrian-style altar). King Ahaz then sent a detailed sketch of this altar, including its full design and every aspect of its construction, to Uriah the priest in Jerusalem.
2 Kings 16:11 So Uriah the priest diligently built an altar exactly according to all the specifications and instructions that King Ahaz had sent him from Damascus. Uriah the priest completed this task before King Ahaz even returned from Damascus.
2 Kings 16:12 When the king returned from Damascus, he saw the new altar. He approached it and venerated it (showing reverence to this foreign, pagan-inspired structure). He then went up to it and offered sacrifices upon it.
2 Kings 16:13 He burned his burnt offerings and his other sacrifices on it, and poured out his drink offerings. He also sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon this altar.
2 Kings 16:14 Furthermore, Ahaz removed the bronze altar that stood before the Lord (the sacred altar originally built by Solomon), which was in front of the Temple, specifically between the new altar and the Temple of the Lord. He moved it from its proper place in front of the Lord’s Temple and positioned it to the side of the new altar.
2 Kings 16:15 King Ahaz then commanded Uriah the priest, saying: "On this larger, new altar (the one copied from Damascus), you are to offer the morning burnt offering and the evening sacrifice. Also offer the king's burnt offering and his sacrifice, along with the burnt offerings of all the people of the land, their sacrifices, and their drink offerings. All the blood from the burnt offerings and all the blood from the sacrifices you shall pour out upon it. The bronze altar (the old, sacred one) will now be reserved for my personal consultation and discretion."
2 Kings 16:16 So Uriah the priest carried out all these instructions, exactly as King Ahaz had commanded him.
2 Kings 16:17 King Ahaz also removed the bronze stands and the basins that rested upon them. He took down the "Sea" (the large bronze basin for ritual washing) from the bronze oxen that supported it, and he placed the "Sea" upon a paved stone platform instead.
2 Kings 16:18 He also removed the covered way for the Sabbath (or "Sabbath structure") that had been built in the Temple. Furthermore, he rerouted the king's outer entrance to the Temple of the Lord, making these changes specifically to appease the King of Assyria and avoid any offense or suspicion.
2 Kings 16:19 Now, the rest of the acts of Ahaz, all that he did, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 16:20 Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. His son Hezekiah then reigned in his place.
2 Kings 17:1 In the twelfth year of King Ahaz of Judah, Hoshea, son of Elah, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned for nine years.
2 Kings 17:2 But he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, though not as evil as the kings of Israel who had reigned before him.
2 Kings 17:3 Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, marched against King Hoshea, and Hoshea became his servant and paid tribute to him.
2 Kings 17:4 But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was conspiring against him. Hoshea had sent messengers to the king of Egypt and had stopped paying his yearly tribute to Assyria. So the king of Assyria arrested Hoshea, chained him, and imprisoned him.
2 Kings 17:5 Then the king of Assyria invaded all of the land of Israel. He marched to Samaria and besieged it for three years.
2 Kings 17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea’s reign, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried the people of Israel into exile to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, and on the Habor River in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings 17:7 This disaster happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt and freed them from the power of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Yet they worshipped other gods.
2 Kings 17:8 They followed the practices of the pagan nations that the Lord had driven out before them. They also imitated the practices of the kings of Israel, which were just as evil.
2 Kings 17:9 The people of Israel secretly did things against the Lord their God that were not right. They built high places for idol worship in all their cities, from watchtowers to fortified cities.
2 Kings 17:10 They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles—idolatrous symbols—on every high hill and under every green tree.
2 Kings 17:11 On all these high places, they burned incense, just like the pagan nations that the Lord had driven out before them. They did wicked things that provoked the Lord’s anger.
2 Kings 17:12 They worshipped idols, even though the Lord had told them, “You must not do such a thing.”
2 Kings 17:13 The Lord had warned both Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers, saying, “Turn from your evil ways. Keep My commandments and My ceremonies according to all the Law that I commanded your fathers and that I sent to you through My servants, the prophets.”
2 Kings 17:14 But they would not listen. They became stubborn, just like their fathers, who had refused to obey the Lord their God.
2 Kings 17:15 They rejected His decrees and the covenant He had made with their fathers, as well as the warnings He had given them. They pursued worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the pagan nations around them, even though the Lord had commanded them not to do as those nations did.
2 Kings 17:16 They abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God. They made for themselves two calves of cast metal, and Asherah poles. They worshipped all the host of the universe—the stars and planets—and they served Baal.
2 Kings 17:17 They sacrificed their sons and daughters in fire as offerings to idols. They practiced divination and omens, and they surrendered themselves to doing evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking His anger.
2 Kings 17:18 So the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from His sight. Only the tribe of Judah was left.
2 Kings 17:19 Even Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God; instead, they followed the sinful practices that Israel had introduced.
2 Kings 17:20 Therefore, the Lord rejected all the people of Israel. He afflicted them and delivered them into the hands of plunderers until He finally cast them out from His presence.
2 Kings 17:21 For Israel had been torn away from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam, son of Nebat, their king. Jeroboam then led Israel away from the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin.
2 Kings 17:22 The people of Israel continued in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed, and they did not turn away from them.
2 Kings 17:23 So the Lord removed Israel from His presence, just as He had spoken through all His servants, the prophets. Thus, Israel was carried away from their own land into Assyria, where they remain to this very day.
2 Kings 17:24 Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the people of Israel. These new inhabitants took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
2 Kings 17:25 When these new inhabitants first began to live there, they did not worship the Lord, so the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
2 Kings 17:26 So the king of Assyria was informed, “The nations whom you have deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the customs of the God of that land. Therefore, the Lord has sent lions among them, and they are killing them because they do not know the proper way to worship the God of that land.”
2 Kings 17:27 Then the king of Assyria gave this command: “Send back one of the priests whom you captured from there. Let him go and live among them and teach them the customs of the God of that land.”
2 Kings 17:28 So one of the priests who had been carried away captive from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and he taught them how they should worship the Lord.
2 Kings 17:29 Nevertheless, each of these foreign nations made their own gods and placed them in the shrines on the high places that the Samaritans had built. Each nation did this in the cities where they lived.
2 Kings 17:30 The people from Babylon made Succoth-Benoth; the people from Cuthah made Nergal; and the people from Hamath made Ashima.
2 Kings 17:31 The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak. And the people from Sepharvaim burned their children in fire as offerings to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
2 Kings 17:32 They did worship the Lord, but they also appointed priests from among themselves for the high places, and these priests offered sacrifices in the shrines of the high places.
2 Kings 17:33 So they worshipped the Lord, but they also served their own gods according to the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.
2 Kings 17:34 Even to this present day, they continue to practice their former customs. They do not truly fear the Lord, nor do they observe His ceremonies, His judgments, His Law, or the commandment that the Lord gave to the children of Jacob, to whom He gave the name Israel.
2 Kings 17:35 When the Lord had made a covenant with them, He commanded them, saying, “You must not fear other gods, nor worship them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them.
2 Kings 17:36 But you must fear the Lord your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. Him alone you must fear, Him alone you must worship, and to Him alone you must sacrifice.
2 Kings 17:37 You must always be careful to observe the ceremonies, the judgments, the Law, and the commandments that He wrote for you. You must not fear other gods.
2 Kings 17:38 And the covenant that I made with you, you must not forget. You must not worship other gods.
2 Kings 17:39 Instead, fear the Lord your God, and He Himself will deliver you from the power of all your enemies.”
2 Kings 17:40 However, they did not listen, but continued to do according to their former customs.
2 Kings 17:1 In the twelfth year of King Achaz of Judah, Osee, the son of Ela, began his reign over Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for nine years.
2 Kings 17:2 And Osee committed evil acts in the presence of the Lord, though not to the same degree as the previous kings of Israel before him.
2 Kings 17:3 Salmanasar, the king of the Assyrians, marched against Osee, and Osee became Salmanasar's vassal and paid him annual tribute.
2 Kings 17:4 But the king of the Assyrians discovered that Osee was secretly conspiring against him, sending messengers to King Sua of Egypt. Osee also stopped paying the tribute he used to send every year. So the king of Assyria besieged Osee and imprisoned him.
2 Kings 17:5 The king of Assyria then marched throughout all the land of Israel, and when he reached Samaria, he besieged it for three years.
2 Kings 17:6 In the ninth year of Osee's reign, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried the people of Israel away as exiles to Assyria. He settled them in Hala and in Habor, near the Gozan River, and in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings 17:7 This happened because the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, the One who had brought them out of the land of Egypt and delivered them from the power of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Yet they worshipped other gods.
2 Kings 17:8 They also followed the customs of the pagan nations whom the Lord had driven out before the children of Israel, and the customs that the kings of Israel had themselves established.
2 Kings 17:9 The children of Israel secretly committed acts against the Lord their God that were not right. They built high places for themselves in all their cities, from the watchman's tower to the fortified city.
2 Kings 17:10 They set up sacred pillars and wooden idols for themselves on every high hill and under every green tree.
2 Kings 17:11 There, on those altars, they burned incense in the manner of the pagan nations whom the Lord had removed from before them. They committed very wicked deeds, provoking the Lord to anger.
2 Kings 17:12 They worshipped filthy idols, concerning which the Lord had explicitly commanded them not to engage in such practices.
2 Kings 17:13 The Lord had warned Israel and Judah through all His prophets and seers, saying: "Turn away from your wicked ways, and keep My commandments and My ceremonies, according to all the Law that I commanded your fathers, and as I sent to you through the hand of My servants, the prophets."
2 Kings 17:14 But they would not listen; instead, they stiffened their necks, just like their fathers had, who refused to obey the Lord their God.
2 Kings 17:15 They rejected His statutes, and the covenant He had made with their fathers, and the warnings He had given them. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the pagan nations around them, concerning whom the Lord had commanded them not to act like them.
2 Kings 17:16 They abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God. They cast for themselves two calves out of metal, and made wooden idols, and worshipped all the heavenly bodies—the entire host of the universe—and served Baal.
2 Kings 17:17 They sacrificed their sons and daughters in fire, and devoted themselves to divination and omens. They committed much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger.
2 Kings 17:18 The Lord became intensely angry with Israel and removed them from His sight. Only the tribe of Judah remained.
2 Kings 17:19 Yet even Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God. Instead, they followed the superstitious practices that Israel had established.
2 Kings 17:20 So the Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel, and afflicted them, and gave them into the hand of plunderers until He finally cast them out from His presence.
2 Kings 17:21 From the time that Israel split from the house of David and appointed Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, as their king, Jeroboam led Israel away from the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin.
2 Kings 17:22 The children of Israel continued in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed, and they did not turn away from them.
2 Kings 17:23 Until the Lord finally removed Israel from His sight, just as He had spoken through all His servants, the prophets. Thus, Israel was carried away from their own land into Assyria, where they remain to this very day.
2 Kings 17:24 The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cutha, Avah, Emath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the children of Israel. These new inhabitants took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
2 Kings 17:25 When they first settled there, these people did not fear the Lord. So the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
2 Kings 17:26 Then it was reported to the king of Assyria, saying: "The nations whom you have relocated and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the laws of the God of that land. Therefore, the Lord has sent lions among them, and indeed, they are killing them, because these people do not know the proper way to worship the God of that land."
2 Kings 17:27 So the king of Assyria commanded, saying: "Send back one of the priests whom you brought as captives from there. Let him go and live among them and teach them the laws of the God of the land."
2 Kings 17:28 So one of the priests who had been carried away captive from Samaria came and settled in Bethel. He taught them how they should worship the Lord, the true God.
2 Kings 17:29 Yet, each of the new nations made their own gods. They placed these gods in the shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had originally built, each nation in the cities where they lived.
2 Kings 17:30 For the men from Babylon made Succoth-benoth. The men from Cutha made Nergal. The men from Hamath made Ashima.
2 Kings 17:31 The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak. And the people from Sepharvaim burned their children as offerings in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
2 Kings 17:32 Even though they were worshipping the Lord, they also appointed priests for their high places from among themselves—these were not true priests of God—and these false priests served in the shrines of the high places.
2 Kings 17:33 While they worshipped the Lord, they also served their own gods, according to the custom of the nations from which they had been brought to Samaria.
2 Kings 17:34 To this very day, they continue to practice their former customs. They do not truly fear the Lord, nor do they keep His ceremonies, His judgments, His law, or the commandment which the Lord had given to the children of Jacob, whom He had named Israel.
2 Kings 17:35 The Lord had made a covenant with them and commanded them, saying: "You shall not fear other gods, nor worship them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them."
2 Kings 17:36 But the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, Him you shall worship, and to Him alone you shall sacrifice.
2 Kings 17:37 And the ceremonies, the judgments, the law, and the commandments which He wrote for you, you shall diligently keep and perform forever. And you shall not fear other gods.
2 Kings 17:38 And the covenant that I made with you, do not forget it. You shall not worship other gods.
2 Kings 17:39 But you shall fear the Lord your God, and He Himself will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.
2 Kings 17:40 Yet these people did not listen to the Lord's commands. Instead, they continued to act according to their former, unholy customs.
2 Kings 17:1 In the twelfth year that Achaz was king of Judah, Osee, the son of Ela, began to reign over Israel in Samaria. He ruled for nine years.
2 Kings 17:2 And Osee did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. His wickedness was not like the kings of Israel who had been before him, but still evil.
2 Kings 17:3 Salmanasar, the king of the Assyrians, marched against Osee. Osee became his servant and had to pay tribute to him.
2 Kings 17:4 But the king of the Assyrians discovered that Osee was conspiring for help. He had sent messengers to King Sua of Egypt and had stopped paying the annual tribute he used to pay. So, the king of Assyria besieged Osee and put him in prison.
2 Kings 17:5 The Assyrian king then went up and laid waste to all the land of Israel, and he came to Samaria, the capital city, and besieged it for three years.
2 Kings 17:6 In the ninth year of Osee’s reign, the king of the Assyrians captured Samaria. He then deported the people of Israel to Assyria, settling them in Hala, and in Habor by the Gozan River, and in the cities of the Medes. This was the end of the Northern Kingdom.
2 Kings 17:7 This all happened because the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God. He was the God who had delivered them from the land of Egypt, from the tyranny of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. But they chose to worship foreign gods instead.
2 Kings 17:8 They had walked according to the rituals of the pagan nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel, and according to the customs that their own kings of Israel had established. Because of this, the Israelites themselves had behaved in exactly the same way as those pagans.
2 Kings 17:9 The children of Israel had also spoken things that were not right against the Lord their God, and they had built high places for idol worship in all their cities—everywhere from the watchtowers of shepherds to the fortified cities.
2 Kings 17:10 They had set up pillars and sacred groves for idol worship on every high hill and under every shady tree, even though God had forbidden these practices.
2 Kings 17:11 There, on these altars, they burned incense just like the pagan nations whom the Lord had driven out from before them. They committed the worst abominations, constantly provoking the Lord to anger.
2 Kings 17:12 They worshipped all the defiling idols and did everything that the Lord had specifically commanded them not to do.
2 Kings 17:13 The Lord had solemnly warned both Israel and Judah through all His prophets and seers, saying: "Turn back from your evil ways and keep My commandments and My ceremonies, according to all the Law that I commanded your fathers. Do as I sent to you through the hands of My servants, the prophets."
2 Kings 17:14 But they refused to listen. Instead, they stiffened their necks, just like their fathers had, those who had refused to obey the Lord their God.
2 Kings 17:15 They rejected His statutes and the covenant He had made with their fathers, and they ignored the warnings by which He had testified to them. They pursued empty idols and behaved in empty ways, following the pagan nations around them, concerning whom the Lord had explicitly commanded them not to act like those nations.
2 Kings 17:16 They abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God. They made two molten calves for themselves, and they worshipped Asherah poles, and bowed down to all the host of heaven—the stars and planets which were worshipped as gods. They also served Baal.
2 Kings 17:17 They made their sons and their daughters pass through fire as offerings to false gods. They practiced divination and used omens, giving themselves over to doing evil in the sight of the Lord, constantly provoking Him to anger.
2 Kings 17:18 So the Lord became extremely angry with Israel and removed them from His sight. Only the tribe of Judah was left.
2 Kings 17:19 Yet even Judah itself did not keep the commandments of the Lord its God. Indeed, they walked in the same errors that Israel had committed.
2 Kings 17:20 The Lord then rejected all the offspring of Israel, afflicting them and delivering them into the hands of plunderers until He finally cast them out from His presence entirely.
2 Kings 17:21 For Israel had indeed been torn away from the house of David. They made Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, their king. He then turned Israel away from the Lord and caused them to commit a great sin.
2 Kings 17:22 And the children of Israel continued to walk in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed. They never departed from these sins,
2 Kings 17:23 until the Lord finally removed Israel from His sight, just as He had spoken through all His servants, the prophets. So, Israel was carried away from their own land into Assyria, and they remain there to this very day.
2 Kings 17:24 Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, from Cutha, from Ava, from Emath, and from Sepharvaim. He settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the children of Israel. These new inhabitants took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
2 Kings 17:25 When they first began to live there, they did not fear the Lord. So the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
2 Kings 17:26 So it was reported to the king of Assyria, saying: "The nations whom you have deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the statutes of the God of the land. Because of this, the Lord has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them, because these people do not know the custom of the God of the land."
2 Kings 17:27 The king of Assyria then commanded, saying: "Bring back one of the priests whom you took captive from there. Let him go and live with them, and teach them the statutes of the God of the land."
2 Kings 17:28 So one of the priests who had been taken captive from Samaria came and lived in Bethel. He taught them how they should worship the Lord.
2 Kings 17:29 But each nation still made its own gods in each of their cities. They put these idols in the shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had built, each nation doing so in the cities where they lived.
2 Kings 17:30 For example, the men from Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men from Cutha made Nergal, and the men from Emath made Ashima.
2 Kings 17:31 Furthermore, the Avvites made Nibaz and Tartak. Those from Sepharvaim even burned their children in fire as offerings to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
2 Kings 17:32 Nevertheless, they also worshipped the Lord. They appointed priests for their high places from among their own people, and these priests served in the shrines of the high places.
2 Kings 17:33 So, while they worshipped the Lord, they also served their own gods according to the custom of the nations from which they had been brought. This syncretism was an abomination to God.
2 Kings 17:34 To this very day, they continue to do things according to their old customs. They do not truly fear the Lord, nor do they observe His ceremonies, or His judgments, or His Law, or the commandment that the Lord had given to the children of Jacob, whom He had named Israel.
2 Kings 17:35 For God had made a covenant with the Israelites and had commanded them, saying: "You shall not worship foreign gods, nor bow down to them, nor serve them, nor offer sacrifices to them. You must worship only Me."
2 Kings 17:36 But you shall worship the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm. You shall worship Him alone and offer sacrifices to Him alone.
2 Kings 17:37 And you shall carefully observe the ceremonies, the judgments, the Law, and the commandment which He wrote for you, so that you may do them at all times. You shall not fear foreign gods.
2 Kings 17:38 And you shall not forget the covenant that I made with you, nor shall you worship foreign gods.
2 Kings 17:39 Instead, you shall worship the Lord your God, and He Himself will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.
2 Kings 17:40 But they did not listen. Instead, they continued to do things according to their old, sinful customs.
2 Kings 18:1 In the third year that Osee, the son of Ela, was king over Israel, Ezechias, the son of Achaz, began to reign as king over Juda.
2 Kings 18:2 He was twenty-five years old when he started his reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Abi, daughter of Zacharias.
2 Kings 18:3 And he did what was good and pleasing before the Lord, just as his ancestor David had done in all things.
2 Kings 18:4 He himself tore down the high places of idolatry, broke apart the pagan statues, cut down the Asherah poles, and crushed the bronze serpent that Moses had made. This was because, up until that time, the sons of Israel had been burning incense to it, and he called it Nohestan, meaning "a piece of bronze."
2 Kings 18:5 He placed his hope and trust in the Lord, the God of Israel. There was no king like him among all the kings of Juda after him, nor among those who came before him.
2 Kings 18:6 And he held fast to the Lord, not departing from His ways, and he kept His commandments, which He had commanded to Moses.
2 Kings 18:7 For this reason, the Lord was with him. And in all that he undertook, he acted prosperously. He also rebelled against the king of the Assyrians and no longer served him.
2 Kings 18:8 He himself struck down the Philistines all the way to Gaza, conquering all their borders, from the watchtower of the shepherds to the fortified city.
2 Kings 18:9 In the fourth year of King Ezechias' reign, which was the seventh year that Osee, the son of Ela, was king of Israel, Salmanasar, the king of the Assyrians, went up against Samaria and besieged it.
2 Kings 18:10 And he captured it after three years, in the sixth year of Ezechias' reign, which was the ninth year that Osee was king of Israel. That is when Samaria was taken.
2 Kings 18:11 And Salmanasar exiled the people of Israel to Assyria. He settled them in Hala and by the Habor River, which is in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings 18:12 This happened because they had not listened to the voice of the Lord their God but had violated His covenant. They did not listen to or obey all the commands that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them.
2 Kings 18:13 In the fourteenth year of King Ezechias' reign, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, marched against all the fortified cities of Juda and captured them.
2 Kings 18:14 Then Ezechias, the king of Juda, sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians in Lachis, saying, "I have sinned; withdraw from me, and I will bear whatever you impose upon me." So the king of the Assyrians demanded from Ezechias, the king of Juda, three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
2 Kings 18:15 And Ezechias gave him all the silver that could be found in the house of the Lord and in the royal treasuries.
2 Kings 18:16 At that time, Ezechias broke off the doors of the temple of the Lord and the gold plates that he himself had affixed to them, and he gave them to the king of the Assyrians.
2 Kings 18:17 But the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan, Rabsaris, and Rabsaces from Lachis to King Ezechias with a great army to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they came to Jerusalem and stood by the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, which is on the road of the fuller's field.
2 Kings 18:18 And they called out for the king. But Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was in charge of the household, along with Sobna the scribe and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, went out to them instead.
2 Kings 18:19 And Rabsaces said to them, "Speak to Ezechias: 'Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this confidence in which you trust?'"
2 Kings 18:20 "'Perhaps you have devised a plan and gathered strength to wage war. In what do you trust that you dare to rebel?'"
2 Kings 18:21 "'Are you relying on that broken reed of a staff, Egypt, upon which if a man leans, it will shatter and pierce his hand? Such is Pharao, the king of Egypt, to all who trust in him.'"
2 Kings 18:22 "'But if you answer me, "We trust in the Lord our God," is it not He whose high places and altars Ezechias has removed, telling Juda and Jerusalem, "You shall worship before these altars in Jerusalem"?'"
2 Kings 18:23 "'Now therefore, give a pledge to my lord, the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you can provide riders for them yourself.'"
2 Kings 18:24 "'And how can you resist even one of the least of my master's servants? Do you have confidence in Egypt because of their chariots and horsemen?'"
2 Kings 18:25 "'Have I come up to this place to destroy it without the Lord's permission? The Lord Himself said to me, "Go up against this land and destroy it."'
2 Kings 18:26 Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsaces, "We beg you to speak to your servants in Aramaic, because we understand that language. Do not speak to us in the language of Juda while the people on the wall are listening."
2 Kings 18:27 And Rabsaces answered them, "Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Was it not rather to the men who sit on the wall, so that they might eat their own excrement and drink their own urine along with you?" This crude statement was meant to provoke fear and disgust among the common people.
2 Kings 18:28 So Rabsaces stood up and cried out with a loud voice in the language of Juda, saying, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians!"
2 Kings 18:29 "Thus says the king: 'Do not let Ezechias deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand.'"
2 Kings 18:30 "'Nor let him make you trust in the Lord, saying, "The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be handed over to the king of the Assyrians."'
2 Kings 18:31 "'Do not listen to Ezechias! For thus says the king of the Assyrians: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat from his own vineyard and from his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cisterns.'"
2 Kings 18:32 "'Until I come and take you away to a land that is like your own land—a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive groves and oil and honey. You will live there and not die. Do not listen to Ezechias, who deceives you by saying, "The Lord will deliver us."'
2 Kings 18:33 "'Have any of the gods of the nations truly delivered their land from the hand of the king of the Assyrians?'"
2 Kings 18:34 "'Where are the gods of Emath and Arphad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Ana, and Ava? Did they deliver Samaria from my hand?'"
2 Kings 18:35 "'Which are the gods among all the lands that have delivered their land from my hand, that the Lord might be able to deliver Jerusalem from my hand?'"
2 Kings 18:36 But the people remained silent and did not answer him a single word, for the king had commanded them, saying, "Do not answer him."
2 Kings 18:37 So Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was in charge of the household, along with Sobna the scribe and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Ezechias with their clothes torn, and they reported to him the words of Rabsaces.
2 Kings 18:1 In the third year of King Hosea, the son of Elah, who was the king of the northern kingdom of Israel, Hezekiah, the son of King Ahaz, began his reign over the southern kingdom of Judah.
2 Kings 18:2 Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he started to reign, and he ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Kings 18:3 Hezekiah lived a life that pleased the Lord, just as his ancestor David had done.
2 Kings 18:4 Hezekiah destroyed the pagan high places, shattered the idol statues, cut down the Asherah poles used for idolatry, and broke into pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made. Even up to that time, the people of Israel had been burning incense to it, worshipping it as an idol. Hezekiah called it Nehushtan, which means 'a piece of bronze'.
2 Kings 18:5 Hezekiah placed his trust in the Lord, the God of Israel. Among all the kings of Judah, there was no one like him, neither before him nor after him.
2 Kings 18:6 He remained faithful to the Lord and did not turn away from following Him. He obeyed the commandments that the Lord had given to Moses.
2 Kings 18:7 Because of this, the Lord was with him, and Hezekiah prospered in everything he undertook. He also rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him any longer.
2 Kings 18:8 Hezekiah attacked and defeated the Philistines, conquering their territory all the way to Gaza and its borders, from the watchtowers of the small villages to the fortified cities.
2 Kings 18:9 In the fourth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, which was also the seventh year of Hosea, the son of Elah, king of the northern kingdom of Israel, Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, marched up against Samaria and laid siege to it.
2 Kings 18:10 After three years, Shalmaneser captured Samaria. This happened in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of King Hosea of the northern kingdom of Israel.
2 Kings 18:11 The Assyrian king then deported the people of Israel to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, and along the Habor River in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes—a historical event that marked the end of the northern kingdom.
2 Kings 18:12 This happened because they did not listen to the voice of the Lord their God. They had broken His covenant and had not obeyed any of the commandments that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them.
2 Kings 18:13 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, marched up and attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
2 Kings 18:14 Then King Hezekiah of Judah sent messengers to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying: "I have sinned. Withdraw your forces from me, and whatever tribute you demand, I will pay." So the king of Assyria imposed upon King Hezekiah of Judah a payment of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
2 Kings 18:15 Hezekiah gave him all the silver that could be found in the house of the Lord and in the royal treasuries.
2 Kings 18:16 At that time, Hezekiah even stripped the gold from the doors of the Lord's Temple and from the doorposts that he himself had overlaid with gold, and he gave it all to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings 18:17 But the king of Assyria sent his chief commander, his chief officer, and his field commander from Lachish with a large army to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. When they had marched up, they arrived at Jerusalem and took up a position by the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, which is on the road to the Washerman's Field.
2 Kings 18:18 They called for the king. So Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, went out to meet them.
2 Kings 18:19 Then the field commander spoke to them, saying: "Tell Hezekiah: 'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is this confidence in which you trust, that you think can save you?'"
2 Kings 18:20 "You might think you have a strategy or the resources to prepare for war, but tell me, on what do you rely that you dare to defy me?"
2 Kings 18:21 "Are you perhaps relying on that broken reed, Egypt, upon which if a man leans, it splinters and pierces his hand? That is exactly what Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is to all who trust in him."
2 Kings 18:22 "But if you say to me, 'We trust in the Lord our God,' then I ask: 'Is this not the God whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed? And Hezekiah commanded Judah and Jerusalem to worship only before this one altar in Jerusalem?'"
2 Kings 18:23 "Now, therefore, make a wager with my lord, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses, if you can find enough riders for them from among your people."
2 Kings 18:24 "How then can you resist even one of my master's least significant officials? You must be relying on Egypt for chariots and horsemen, as you have no strength of your own."
2 Kings 18:25 "Furthermore, do you think I have come up against this place to destroy it without the Lord's will? No, the Lord Himself said to me: 'Go up against this land and destroy it.'"
2 Kings 18:26 Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah said to the field commander: "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah while the people who are on the wall are listening, as it will demoralize them."
2 Kings 18:27 But the field commander replied to them: "Has my master sent me to speak these words only to your master and to you? Is it not also to the men who are sitting on the wall, who will soon be forced to eat their own dung and drink their own urine along with you, because of the siege?"
2 Kings 18:28 So the field commander stood up and shouted in a loud voice, in the language of Judah, saying: "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
2 Kings 18:29 "This is what the king says: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot deliver you from my hand.'"
2 Kings 18:30 "Nor should he persuade you to rely on the Lord, saying: 'The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'"
2 Kings 18:31 "Do not listen to Hezekiah. For this is what the king of Assyria says: 'Make peace with me and surrender to me. Then each of you will be able to enjoy your own vineyard and fig tree, and drink water from your own cisterns—a promise of prosperity under Assyrian rule.'"
2 Kings 18:32 "Until I come and take you away to a land like your own, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive groves and honey. You will live there and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah, who deceives you by saying: 'The Lord will deliver us.'"
2 Kings 18:33 "Have the gods of any of the nations ever delivered their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?"
2 Kings 18:34 "Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?"
2 Kings 18:35 "Which of all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand, that the Lord could deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"
2 Kings 18:36 But the people remained silent and did not answer him a single word, for the king had given a strict command: "Do not answer him."
2 Kings 18:37 Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn in an expression of grief, and reported to him the words of the field commander.
2 Kings 18:1 It was during the third year that Osee, the son of Ela, ruled as king of Israel, when Ezechias, the son of Achaz, began to reign as king of Judah.
2 Kings 18:2 Ezechias was twenty-five years old when he began his reign, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abi, the daughter of Zacharias.
2 Kings 18:3 He did what was good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord, just as his father David had done in all things.
2 Kings 18:4 It was Ezechias who destroyed the high places of idolatry, broke apart the pagan statues, cut down the Asherah poles, and crushed the bronze serpent that Moses had made. The reason he did this was because, up to that very time, the children of Israel were still offering incense to it, and he named it Nohestan, meaning a mere piece of bronze.
2 Kings 18:5 Ezechias placed his hope and trust in the Lord, the God of Israel. No king like him, among all the kings of Judah, arose after him, nor among those who ruled before him.
2 Kings 18:6 He remained faithful to the Lord and did not turn away from His commandments. He kept all the commands that the Lord had given to Moses.
2 Kings 18:7 The Lord was with him, and in everything he undertook, he acted with wisdom. He even rebelled against the king of the Assyrians and refused to serve him.
2 Kings 18:8 It was Ezechias who struck down the Philistines, conquering all their territory from the watchtowers of their outposts all the way to the fortified cities, extending his victory even to Gaza.
2 Kings 18:9 In the fourth year of King Ezechias’ reign — which was also the seventh year that Osee, the son of Ela, ruled as king of Israel — Salmanasar, the king of the Assyrians, marched against Samaria and besieged the city.
2 Kings 18:10 And after three years of siege, Salmanasar took the city. This occurred in the sixth year of Ezechias’ reign, which was the ninth year that Osee ruled as king of Israel, when Samaria was finally captured.
2 Kings 18:11 Then the king of Assyria deported the people of Israel into Assyria, settling them in Hala, and in Habor by the river Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings 18:12 This happened because they did not listen to the voice of the Lord their God. Instead, they broke His covenant and did not obey or follow any of the commandments that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them.
2 Kings 18:13 In the fourteenth year of King Ezechias’ reign, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, marched against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
2 Kings 18:14 At that time, Ezechias, the king of Judah, sent messengers to the king of Assyria in Lachis, saying, "I have sinned. Withdraw from me, and whatever you impose on me, I will bear it." So the king of Assyria demanded from Ezechias, the king of Judah, three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
2 Kings 18:15 And Ezechias gave him all the silver that could be found in the House of the Lord and in the royal treasuries.
2 Kings 18:16 At that same time, Ezechias cut off the gold from the doors of the Lord’s temple and from the gold plates which he himself had affixed to them, and he gave them to the king of Assyria.
2 Kings 18:17 Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent Tharthan, Rabsaris, and Rabsacen from Lachis to King Ezechias with a powerful army against Jerusalem. When they arrived, they came to Jerusalem and took up positions by the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, which is on the road to the Fuller’s Field.
2 Kings 18:18 They called for the king, and so Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was in charge of the palace, along with Sobna the scribe and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, went out to meet them.
2 Kings 18:19 Then Rabsacen said to them, "Speak to Ezechias: ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is this confidence in which you are trusting?’"
2 Kings 18:20 “‘Perhaps you have formed a plan to prepare yourself for war, but in what do you place your trust that you dare to defy me?’"
2 Kings 18:21 “‘Do you truly hope and trust in Egypt, that broken reed staff, which if a man leans on it, will splinter and pierce his hand? That is exactly what Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is like to all who trust in him.’"
2 Kings 18:22 “‘But if you say to me, "We trust in the Lord our God," is He not the very one whose high places and altars Ezechias removed? Did Ezechias not command Judah and Jerusalem saying, "You shall worship only before this single altar in Jerusalem?"’"
2 Kings 18:23 “‘Now therefore, make a pledge to my lord, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able to provide riders for them from your own forces.’"
2 Kings 18:24 “‘How then can you resist even one of the least of my master’s servants? Do you truly place your trust in Egypt because of their chariots and horsemen?’"
2 Kings 18:25 “‘Have I come up against this place to destroy it without the Lord’s approval? No! The Lord Himself said to me, "Go up against this land and destroy it."’"
2 Kings 18:26 Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsacen, "We beg you, please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah while the people who are on the wall are listening."
2 Kings 18:27 But Rabsacen answered them, "Has my master sent me to your master and to you alone to speak these words? Is it not rather to the men who sit on the wall, so that they may be forced to eat their own dung and drink their own urine along with you?"
2 Kings 18:28 So Rabsacen stood and cried out with a loud voice in the language of Judah, saying, "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
2 Kings 18:29 “‘This is what the king says: "Do not let Ezechias deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand."’"
2 Kings 18:30 “‘Nor let him persuade you to trust in the Lord by saying, "The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."’"
2 Kings 18:31 “‘Do not listen to Ezechias! For this is what the king of Assyria says: "Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will be able to eat from your own vine and your own fig tree, and drink water from your own cisterns.’"
2 Kings 18:32 “‘Until I come and take you away to a land that is like your own land — a land of grain and wine, a land of fruit, olive groves, olive oil, and honey. You will live there and not die. Do not listen to Ezechias, who deceives you by saying, "The Lord will deliver us."’"
2 Kings 18:33 “‘Have the gods of the other nations ever delivered their own land from the hand of the king of Assyria?’"
2 Kings 18:34 “‘Where are the gods of Emath and Arphad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Ana, and Ava? Did they deliver Samaria from my hand?’"
2 Kings 18:35 “‘Which of all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand, that the Lord should be able to deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’"
2 Kings 18:36 But the people remained silent and did not answer him a single word, because the king’s command was clear: "Do not answer him."
2 Kings 18:37 Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was in charge of the palace, and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Ezechias with their clothes torn, and they reported to him the words of Rabsacen.
2 Kings 19:1 When King Hezekiah heard this news, he tore his garments to show his great distress, wrapped himself in sackcloth to show his sorrow and repentance, and went into the Temple of the Lord to pray.
2 Kings 19:2 Then King Hezekiah sent Eliakim, the steward of his palace, and Shebna the royal scribe, and the senior priests (all of them clothed in sackcloth, just as the King was, to show their shared sorrow), to the Prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz.
2 Kings 19:3 And they delivered the message to him, saying: 'King Hezekiah says this: This is a day of tremendous anguish, of God's rebuke, and of blasphemy against the True God. It is as if a woman is in labor, and the children are ready to be born, but she has no strength left to deliver them. We are in a critical situation, but we are too weak to bring about our own rescue.'
2 Kings 19:4 'Perhaps the Lord your God will hear all the words of Sennacherib, whom the king of Assyria, his master, has sent to insult the living God, and will rebuke him for the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, lift up your prayers for the small remnant that remains of us.'
2 Kings 19:5 So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2 Kings 19:6 And Isaiah said to them: 'Say this to your master: The Lord says this: Do not be afraid because of the words you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.'
2 Kings 19:7 'Behold, I will put a spirit within him (a divine impulse of fear or decision), and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land. And there, in his own land, I will cause him to be struck down by the sword.'
2 Kings 19:8 So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, because he had moved his forces from Lachish.
2 Kings 19:9 For Sennacherib had heard a report about Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, that he had set out to fight against him. And so, the king of Assyria again sent messengers to King Hezekiah, saying:
2 Kings 19:10 'Say this to Hezekiah, king of Judah: Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying: Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
2 Kings 19:11 'Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other lands, how they utterly destroyed them. And do you think you can be delivered?'
2 Kings 19:12 'Did the gods of the nations deliver those whom my fathers destroyed, like Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?'
2 Kings 19:13 'Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and of Ivvah?'
2 Kings 19:14 And Hezekiah received the letters (the written messages) from the hand of the messengers and read them. Then he went up to the Temple of the Lord and spread the letters out before the Lord.
2 Kings 19:15 And Hezekiah prayed in His presence, saying: 'O Lord, God of Israel, Who sits enthroned above the Cherubim (representing Your divine presence), You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth; You created the entire universe and the earth.'
2 Kings 19:16 'Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear! Open Your eyes, O Lord, and see! And listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent his messengers to insult the living God.'
2 Kings 19:17 'It is true, O Lord, that the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands, destroying all of them.'
2 Kings 19:18 'And they threw the pagan gods of those nations into the fire, for those were not truly gods, but merely the work of human hands, made of wood and stone. That is why the Assyrians were able to destroy them.'
2 Kings 19:19 'Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are the Lord God.'
2 Kings 19:20 Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent a message to Hezekiah, saying: 'Thus says the Lord God of Israel: I have heard your prayer regarding Sennacherib, the king of Assyria.'
2 Kings 19:21 'This is the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion (Jerusalem) despises you and mocks you; the daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head behind you (in derision).'
2 Kings 19:22 'Whom have you insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes so proudly to the heavens? It was against the Holy One of Israel!'
2 Kings 19:23 'By the hand of your messengers, you have insulted the Lord, and you said: “With the multitude of my chariots, I have ascended the highest mountains, to the peaks of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars and its choicest fir trees. I penetrated its farthest reaches, even to its thickest forest, like the forest of Carmel.”'
2 Kings 19:24 '“I myself have dug wells and drunk foreign waters. With the sole of my foot, I have dried up all the rivers of the besieged lands.”'
2 Kings 19:25 'Have you not heard that I (God) have prepared this from long ago? From ancient days, I (God) planned it, and now I (God) have brought it to pass. It was I who decreed that fortified cities would become heaps of rubble.'
2 Kings 19:26 'And those who lived in those cities were put to shame and trembled with fear. They became like the grass of the field, and like the tender herb of the pasture, and like the dry grass on the rooftops, which withers before it grows tall.'
2 Kings 19:27 'I (God) know your dwelling, and your going out, and your coming in, and your way of life. All your movements and intentions were known to Me.'
2 Kings 19:28 'Because you have raged against Me, and your arrogance has reached My ears, I will put My hook in your nose and My bridle in your lips, and I will lead you back by the very way you came.'
2 Kings 19:29 'And this will be a sign to you, Hezekiah: This year, you will eat what grows of itself (from the scattered seeds of the previous harvest); and in the second year, you will eat what springs up from that. But in the third year, you will sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruit.'
2 Kings 19:30 'And the remnant that escapes from the house of Judah and remains will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.'
2 Kings 19:31 'For from Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and from Mount Zion will come those who are saved. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this.'
2 Kings 19:32 'Therefore, thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He will not enter this city, nor will he shoot an arrow into it, nor will he bring a shield against it, nor will he build up a siege ramp against it.'
2 Kings 19:33 'By the way he came, by the same way he will return. And this city he will not enter, declares the Lord.'
2 Kings 19:34 'For I will protect this city and save it, for My own sake and for the sake of My servant David.'
2 Kings 19:35 And it came to pass that very night, the Angel of the Lord went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians. When people rose early in the morning, they saw all the bodies of the dead.
2 Kings 19:36 So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, broke camp and departed. He returned to his land and remained in Nineveh.
2 Kings 19:37 And as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch, his pagan god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword. They then fled into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 19:1 When King Hezekiah heard this message of blasphemy and threat, he tore his royal garments in a display of profound grief and lamentation. He then wrapped himself in sackcloth, as a visible sign of his humility and penitence before God. After this, he immediately went into the Temple of the Lord to seek divine counsel.
2 Kings 19:2 King Hezekiah sent Eliakim, who was the royal steward in charge of the palace, along with Shebna the royal secretary, and the most senior priests—all of whom were also dressed in sackcloth as a sign of their shared national distress—to the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, to seek a prophetic word from God.
2 Kings 19:3 These men then reported to Isaiah King Hezekiah's words: 'This day is a day of deep affliction, of severe rebuke from God, and of direct blasphemy against His holy Name, hurled by the Assyrians. Our nation is in such a desperate state, like a woman in labor who has reached the point of birth but lacks the strength to deliver her child—we are at the brink of destruction with no power to save ourselves.'
2 Kings 19:4 'Perhaps the Lord your God has heard all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the King of Assyria, his master, sent to mock and insult the living God, and the Lord your God will condemn these words that He heard: please, then, raise up a fervent prayer for the small remnant of our people who are still left and found alive.'
2 Kings 19:5 So, the servants of King Hezekiah—Eliakim, Shebna, and the senior priests—came before the prophet Isaiah.
2 Kings 19:6 And Isaiah declared to them, 'Tell your master, King Hezekiah, this message from the Lord: 'Do not be afraid because of the words you have heard—the blasphemous insults uttered against Me by the servants of the King of Assyria. These are mere human words, but they are an affront to the living God.''
2 Kings 19:7 'Indeed, I am now going to put a spirit into him—a spirit of fear and urgency—so that when he hears a report about his homeland, he will immediately return to his own country. And there, in his own land, I will cause him to fall by the sword; he will meet a violent end.'
2 Kings 19:8 So Rabshakeh, the Assyrian general, returned to his king, Sennacherib, and found him battling near Libnah. This was because Rabshakeh had already heard that the Assyrian king had withdrawn from his siege of Lachish.
2 Kings 19:9 Now, King Sennacherib had received a report concerning Tirhakah, the King of Ethiopia (also known as the Kushite King), stating: 'Indeed, he has marched out to wage war against you.' Because of this new threat, Sennacherib once again sent messengers to King Hezekiah of Judah, instructing them with a new message, saying:
2 Kings 19:10 'Say this to King Hezekiah of Judah: 'Do not let your God, in whom you place your trust and confidence, deceive you by saying: 'Jerusalem will not be handed over into the power of the King of Assyria.' Do not be misled by such false hope.''
2 Kings 19:11 'Look, you have heard and know very well what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries they have conquered, and how utterly and powerfully they have devastated them and brought them to ruin. So, do you truly believe that you alone will be able to be delivered from our grasp?'
2 Kings 19:12 'Have the false gods of the nations—each one of them—been able to deliver their people whom my forefathers destroyed? Have they saved Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, or the people of Eden who lived in Telassar? No, they have not!'
2 Kings 19:13 'Where are the kings of Hamath and Arpad now? And where is the king of the city of Sepharvaim? And where are the kings of Hena and Ivvah? They are all gone, conquered by my armies, and their gods could not save them!'
2 Kings 19:14 King Hezekiah received these threatening letters from the messengers and read their blasphemous contents. He then went up into the Temple of the Lord, and there, in a powerful act of supplication and faith, Hezekiah spread out the letters before the Lord God.
2 Kings 19:15 And Hezekiah prayed fervently in the sight of the Lord, declaring: 'O Lord, the God of Israel, You who are enthroned above the cherubim—You alone are the one true God of all the kingdoms and nations of the earth. You are the Almighty Creator, for You made the entire universe and the earth!'
2 Kings 19:16 'Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear our plea! Open Your divine eyes, O Lord, and see our distress! Hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he sent to mock and insult You, the living God, and thereby bring shame upon us, Your people.'
2 Kings 19:17 'It is true, O Lord, that the kings of Assyria have indeed laid waste to the nations and all their lands, just as their arrogant letter boasts.'
2 Kings 19:18 'And they have thrown the false gods of those nations into the fire and destroyed them. But these so-called gods were not truly gods at all; they were merely the lifeless work of human hands, fashioned from wood and stone, and thus the Assyrians were able to easily destroy them.'
2 Kings 19:19 'Now therefore, O Lord our God, we humbly pray: deliver us from the powerful hand of this Assyrian king, Sennacherib. Do this so that all the kingdoms and nations of the earth may come to know and acknowledge that You alone are the Lord God, the one true and living God!'
2 Kings 19:20 Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent a message back to King Hezekiah, saying: 'This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: 'I have heard your earnest prayer concerning Sennacherib, the King of Assyria. Your petition has reached My ears.''
2 Kings 19:21 'This is the divine word which the Lord has spoken concerning Sennacherib: 'The virgin daughter of Zion—meaning the city of Jerusalem, pristine and undefiled by conquest—despises you and scoffs at your threats! The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head in defiant scorn at you, King Sennacherib!''
2 Kings 19:22 'Whom have you mocked and insulted with your words? Against whom have you raised your voice in arrogance, and lifted your eyes in proud defiance? You have done this against the Holy One of Israel Himself!'
2 Kings 19:23 'By the hands of your messengers, you have indeed mocked the Lord God, and you have arrogantly declared: 'With my vast chariots and my mighty army, I have ascended the highest mountain peaks, even the very summits of Lebanon! I have cut down its tallest cedars and its finest cypress trees, and I have penetrated deep into its farthest reaches, into its most fertile forest, like its glorious Carmel!''
2 Kings 19:24 'You have further boasted: 'I have personally dug wells and drunk foreign waters in conquered lands, and with the sole of my foot, I have dried up all the fortified streams of Egypt!' Your arrogance knows no bounds, thinking your power is limitless.
2 Kings 19:25 'Have you not heard, King Sennacherib, that I, the Lord, have ordained this from long ago? From ancient times, I planned it, shaping and forming it according to My divine will. And now, I have brought it to pass: that you would turn fortified cities into piles of rubble, becoming a ruin of warring hills and strong cities, all as part of My grand design!'
2 Kings 19:26 'Therefore, the inhabitants of those conquered lands had little power to resist; they were utterly dismayed and disgraced. They became like the grass of the field and the tender green plants, easily withered; like the thin grass on rooftops, scorched and dried up before it grows tall.'
2 Kings 19:27 'But I, the Lord, know your every move: your comings and goings, your habitation, your entire way of life, and your journeying—I know all of it! And I also know the raging madness and fury that you direct against Me, the living God!'
2 Kings 19:28 'Because you have raged against Me, and your arrogant boasting has ascended into My ears, I will place a hook in your nose and a bridle in your lips, just as one would do to a wild, untamed beast. And I will turn you back and lead you away along the very road by which you came, forcing your retreat!'
2 Kings 19:29 'And this, O King Hezekiah, will be a miraculous sign for you and your people that My promise is true: This year, you will eat what grows naturally from scattered seeds left over from the previous harvest. And in the second year, you will eat what springs up from the ground on its own, without cultivation. But in the third year, you will once again be able to sow seed and reap a proper harvest, and you will plant vineyards and eat their fruits in peace.'
2 Kings 19:30 'And the remnant that has escaped from the House of Judah—those who remain faithful and alive—will again take deep root downward into the land, and they will produce abundant fruit upward, signifying spiritual and physical prosperity.'
2 Kings 19:31 'For from Jerusalem will come forth a saving remnant, and those who remain alive from Mount Zion—they will be preserved. The fervent zeal and passionate determination of the Lord of Hosts, the Commander of heavenly armies, will accomplish this divine intervention!'
2 Kings 19:32 Therefore, this is what the Lord declares concerning the King of Assyria: 'He shall not enter this holy city of Jerusalem; he will not even shoot an arrow into it. No shield will be raised against it, nor will he build a siege ramp against its walls, for I will protect it absolutely.'
2 Kings 19:33 'By the very road he came, by that same road will he return in retreat. He shall not enter this city,' declares the Lord, the Almighty God.
2 Kings 19:34 'For I will protect this city, and I will save it, not for their merit, but for My own honor and glory, and for the sake of My loyal servant, King David, and the covenant I made with him.'
2 Kings 19:35 So, it came to pass on that very night, that an angel of the Lord—a powerful heavenly messenger—went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian military camp. When the remaining Assyrians rose early the next morning, they looked out and saw all these vast numbers of dead bodies, realizing a catastrophic supernatural event had occurred.
2 Kings 19:36 Then King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and departed immediately. He retreated from the land of Judah, returned to his own territory, and settled in his capital city, Nineveh.
2 Kings 19:37 And it happened that while Sennacherib was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch, his demon-god, his own sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, struck him down with a sword and killed him. They then fled for their lives to the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon, another of Sennacherib's sons, became king in his place.
2 Kings 20:1 In those days, King Hezekiah became so sick he was going to die. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, went in to see him and said, "This is what the Lord says: Set your affairs in order, because you will die and not live."
2 Kings 20:2 Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall and prayed to the Lord, saying:
2 Kings 20:3 "I beg you, Lord, please remember, I pray, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and how I have done what was pleasing in your sight." And Hezekiah wept with great sorrow.
2 Kings 20:4 And it happened, before Isaiah had even left the middle part of the courtyard, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying:
2 Kings 20:5 Go back, and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people: "This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and I have seen your tears. Indeed, I will add fifteen years to your life."
2 Kings 20:6 And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will protect this city.
2 Kings 20:7 Then Isaiah said, "Bring a poultice of figs." When they brought it and applied it to his boil, he recovered.
2 Kings 20:8 Now Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I will go up to the Temple of the Lord on the third day?"
2 Kings 20:9 Isaiah answered him, "This will be the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do what He has promised: Do you want the shadow to advance ten steps, or to go back ten steps?"
2 Kings 20:10 Hezekiah said, "It is easy for the shadow to move forward ten steps, but I do not want that. Instead, let the shadow move back ten steps."
2 Kings 20:11 Then the prophet Isaiah called upon the Lord, and God made the shadow on the sundial of Ahaz go back ten steps, which it had already descended.
2 Kings 20:12 At that time, Berodach-Baladan, son of Baladan, the king of the Babylonians, sent letters and gifts to King Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
2 Kings 20:13 Hezekiah heard what they had to say, and then he showed them all the treasures of his palace: the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oils, his armory, and everything that could be found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
2 Kings 20:14 Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men say, and where did they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came from a distant land, from Babylon."
2 Kings 20:15 Isaiah then asked, "What did they see in your palace?" Hezekiah answered, "They saw everything that is in my palace. There was nothing in my treasuries that I did not show them."
2 Kings 20:16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the Lord."
2 Kings 20:17 Behold, the days are coming when everything in your palace, and everything that your ancestors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the Lord.
2 Kings 20:18 And some of your sons, who will come from you, whom you will father, will be taken and made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
2 Kings 20:19 Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "The word of the Lord that you have spoken is good. Let there be peace and stability during my lifetime."
2 Kings 20:20 As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool and the aqueduct and brought water into the city—are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 20:21 And Hezekiah slept with his ancestors, and his son Manasseh reigned in his place.
2 Kings 21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign. He reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hephzibah.
2 Kings 21:2 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, following the abominable practices of the pagan nations that the Lord had driven out from before the children of Israel.
2 Kings 21:3 For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He set up altars for Baal and made sacred groves, just as Ahab, the king of Israel, had done. Manasseh also worshipped all the celestial bodies of the sky, serving them as gods.
2 Kings 21:4 He built altars in the Temple of the Lord, regarding which the Lord had said: “In Jerusalem I will establish my presence.”
2 Kings 21:5 He built altars for all the celestial bodies of the sky in both courtyards of the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 21:6 He also made his son pass through fire as a sacrifice, consulted diviners, practiced sorcery, engaged in witchcraft, and greatly multiplied those who consulted familiar spirits and wizards. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger.
2 Kings 21:7 He placed an idol of the sacred grove, which he had made, in the Temple of the Lord. Regarding this Temple, the Lord had said to David and to his son Solomon: “In this Temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will establish my name forever.”
2 Kings 21:8 And I will no longer allow the feet of Israel to wander from the land which I gave to their fathers—that is, if they will carefully observe my commandments and the entire Law that I commanded them through my servant Moses.
2 Kings 21:9 But they did not listen. Instead, Manasseh misled them to do more evil than the pagan nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.
2 Kings 21:10 Then the Lord spoke through His servants, the prophets, saying:
2 Kings 21:11 “Because Manasseh, the king of Judah, has committed these most wicked abominations—doing more evil than all the Amorites before him—and has also made Judah sin with his idols,
2 Kings 21:12 therefore, this is what the Lord God of Israel says: 'Behold, I am bringing such disaster upon Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears about it will ring with terror.
2 Kings 21:13 I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plumb line of the house of Ahab. I will wipe away Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
2 Kings 21:14 And I will abandon the remnant of my heritage, delivering them into the hand of their enemies. They will become plunder and a prey to all their adversaries,
2 Kings 21:15 because they have done evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, from the day their fathers came out of Egypt until this very day.’”
2 Kings 21:16 Moreover, Manasseh shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from one end to the other. This was in addition to his sins by which he made Judah sin and do evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Kings 21:17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and the sin he committed, are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 21:18 Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the Garden of Uzza. And his son Amon reigned in his place.
2 Kings 21:19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign. He reigned for two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz, from Jotbah.
2 Kings 21:20 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Manasseh had done.
2 Kings 21:21 He walked in every way that his father had walked. He served the detestable idols that his father had served and worshipped them.
2 Kings 21:22 He abandoned the Lord, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the Lord.
2 Kings 21:23 Now the servants of Amon conspired against him and killed the king in his own house.
2 Kings 21:24 But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then they made his son Josiah king in his place.
2 Kings 21:25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are these not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 21:26 They buried him in his tomb in the Garden of Uzza. And his son Josiah reigned in his place.
2 Kings 21:27 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign. He reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah, from Bozkath.
2 Kings 21:28 And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord. He walked in all the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.
2 Kings 21:29 Now in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a boy, he began to seek the God of his father David. In the twelfth year of his reign, he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the sacred groves, the carved idols, and the molten images.
2 Kings 21:30 Before him, they tore down the altars of the Baals, and he smashed the altars that were placed above them. He cut down the sacred groves and the carved idols, breaking them into pieces. He pulverized the idol fields and scattered their dust over the tombs of those who had offered sacrifices there.
2 Kings 21:31 He also burned the altars of the idols all around, cut down the sacred groves, and crushed the carved and molten images into dust. He scattered the dust over the graves of the common people.
2 Kings 21:32 He did likewise in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naphtali, destroying idolatry throughout the surrounding areas.
2 Kings 21:33 When he returned to Jerusalem, passing through the Temple of the Lord, he found the book of the Law of the Lord given through Moses in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 21:34 This is what Hilkiah the priest found and gave to Shaphan the scribe, and he read it in the presence of the king.
2 Kings 21:35 When the king heard the words of the Law of the Lord, he tore his garments and prayed to the Lord.
2 Kings 21:36 Then he commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Abdon, the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, the king’s servant, saying:
2 Kings 21:37 “Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For great is the wrath of the Lord that has been poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the words of the Lord to do everything written in this book.”
2 Kings 21:38 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Abdon, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter. They spoke to her the words that had been previously said to them.
2 Kings 21:39 And she answered them: “Thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me:
2 Kings 21:40 “This is what the Lord says: 'Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in this book which they have read before the king of Judah.
2 Kings 22:1 Josias was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Idida, daughter of Adaja, from the town of Besecath.
2 Kings 22:2 He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord. He walked in the full path of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.
2 Kings 22:3 In the eighteenth year of King Josias's reign, the king sent Saphan, son of Asaliah, son of Messulam, who was the scribe of the Lord's Temple, saying:
2 Kings 22:4 "Go to Helcias, the high priest. Tell him to assess the money that has been brought into the Lord's Temple. This money was collected by the doorkeepers from the people."
2 Kings 22:5 "And let him give this money to the carpenters, and to the masons, and to those who cut stones. Let them also buy wood and cut stones so that they may repair and rebuild the Temple of the Lord."
2 Kings 22:6 There was no accounting required with them for the money they received, because they acted with faithfulness and integrity.
2 Kings 22:7 Then Helcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe, "I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord." And Helcias gave the book to Saphan, who then read it.
2 Kings 22:8 Saphan the scribe came to the king and reported what the king had commanded him. Afterwards, Saphan informed the king, saying, "Helcias the priest gave me a book." When Saphan read the book aloud before the king,
2 Kings 22:9 and the king heard the words of the book, which was the Law of the Lord, he tore his clothes in grief and repentance.
2 Kings 22:10 And he commanded Helcias the priest, and Achicam the son of Saphan, and Achobor the son of Micha, and Saphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's servant, saying:
2 Kings 22:11 "Go and consult the Lord on my behalf, and on behalf of the people, and on behalf of all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For the great wrath of the Lord has been kindled against us, because our fathers did not listen to the words of this book, so as to do all that is written and commanded for us."
2 Kings 22:12 So Helcias the priest, and Achicam, and Achobor, and Saphan, and Asaiah, went to Olda the prophetess. She was the wife of Sellum, son of Thecue, son of Araas, the keeper of the vestments. She was living in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter. They spoke to her, seeking guidance.
2 Kings 22:13 And she answered them, saying, "Thus says the Lord God of Israel: 'Tell the man who sent you to me:
2 Kings 22:14 Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants—all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read. This punishment will certainly come to pass."
2 Kings 22:15 "This is because they have abandoned Me and have sacrificed to foreign gods, provoking Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore, My indignation has been kindled against this place, and it will not be extinguished."
2 Kings 22:16 "But to the king of Judah, who sent you to consult the Lord, thus you shall say: 'Thus says the Lord God of Israel: Because you have heard the words of the scroll,
2 Kings 22:17 and your heart was humbled, and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard the words against this place and against its inhabitants—that they would become a desolation and a curse—and you tore your garments and wept before Me, I have heard you, says the Lord."
2 Kings 22:18 "Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your tomb in peace. Your eyes shall not see all the evils which I am about to bring upon this place.'" And they reported to the king everything she had said.
2 Kings 22:19 So the king sent messengers and gathered to himself all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Kings 22:20 And the king went up to the Temple of the Lord, and all the men of Judah, and all those who lived in Jerusalem went with him—the priests and the prophets, and all the people, from the least important to the greatest. And he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant, which had been found in the house of the Lord.
2 Kings 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign. He reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Idida, daughter of Adaja, from Besecath.
2 Kings 22:2 He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and he walked in all the ways of his father David. He did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
2 Kings 22:3 In the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, who was the scribe of the Temple of the Lord. The king said to him:
2 Kings 22:4 “Go to Hilkiah, the high priest, so that he may gather the money that has been brought into the Temple of the Lord by the doorkeepers, who were entrusted with keeping it safe.
2 Kings 22:5 And let him give this money to the workmen, to the carpenters, and to the masons, who are repairing the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 22:6 And let them use the money to restore the walls, and to buy timber and cut stones for the repair of the places in the Temple of the Lord.”
2 Kings 22:7 However, the money that they receive for this work is not to be accounted for, but it is to be given to them based on their authority and trustworthiness.
2 Kings 22:8 Then Hilkiah, the high priest, said to Shaphan, the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord.” Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and Shaphan read it.
2 Kings 22:9 Shaphan, the scribe, came back to the king and reported what had been commanded. Furthermore, he informed the king, saying, “Your servants have given the money that was found in the house of the Lord to the workmen and to those who supervise the work in the Temple of the Lord.”
2 Kings 22:10 Shaphan, the scribe, also told the king, saying, “Hilkiah, the priest, gave me a book.” And when Shaphan had read it in the presence of the king,
2 Kings 22:11 and the king heard the words of the book of the Law of the Lord, he tore his garments in a sign of deep distress and repentance.
2 Kings 22:12 Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, the king's servant, saying:
2 Kings 22:13 “Go, and consult the Lord on my behalf, and on behalf of the people, and on behalf of all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found. For the wrath of the Lord is greatly kindled against us, because our fathers did not listen to the words of this book, to do all that is written for us.”
2 Kings 22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess. She was the wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, who was the keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter of the city. They spoke to her.
2 Kings 22:15 And she answered them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me:
2 Kings 22:16 Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am bringing disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants, according to all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read.
2 Kings 22:17 Because they have abandoned Me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, provoking Me with all the works of their hands, My indignation will be kindled against this place, and it will not be extinguished.’
2 Kings 22:18 But to the king of Judah, who sent you to consult the Lord, you shall say this: ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because you have heard the words of the book,
2 Kings 22:19 and your heart was moved, and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard the words against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse—and because you tore your garments and wept before Me—I also have heard it,’ says the Lord.
2 Kings 22:20 Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the evil that I am bringing upon this place.” And they reported her words to the king.
2 Kings 23:1 King Josiah then sent messengers, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem gathered before him.
2 Kings 23:2 The king went up to the Temple of the Lord, and with him were all the men of Judah, everyone living in Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people, from the youngest to the oldest. He read aloud to everyone the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the Lord.
2 Kings 23:3 The king then stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the Lord, promising to follow the Lord, to keep His commandments, His testimonies, and His ceremonies with all his heart and all his soul, and to uphold the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people agreed to the covenant.
2 Kings 23:4 The king then commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second rank, and the doorkeepers to remove from the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that had been made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of the heavens—meaning, all the objects used for pagan worship. He burned these things outside Jerusalem in the Kidron Valley and carried their ashes to Bethel.
2 Kings 23:5 He abolished the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense on the high places throughout the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem. He also abolished those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of the heavens.
2 Kings 23:6 He had the Asherah pole—a pagan idol—carried out from the Lord’s house, outside Jerusalem, into the Kidron Valley. He burned it there, ground it to dust, and threw the dust on the graves of the common people to defile them.
2 Kings 23:7 He also tore down the quarters of the male cult prostitutes, which were in the house of the Lord, where women wove garments for the idol Asherah.
2 Kings 23:8 He gathered all the priests from the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where these priests had offered sacrifices, from Geba to Beersheba. He also tore down the altars at the gates, specifically the one at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which was on the left side as one entered the gate.
2 Kings 23:9 However, the priests from these high places were not allowed to ascend to the Lord’s altar in Jerusalem; instead, they ate unleavened bread among their fellow priests.
2 Kings 23:10 He also defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so that no one could consecrate his son or daughter by passing them through fire to Molech—a horrific pagan ritual.
2 Kings 23:11 And he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun god, located at the entrance of the house of the Lord, near the chamber of Nathan-Melech, the eunuch who was in charge of the storerooms. He also burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
2 Kings 23:12 The king also tore down the altars that were on the roof of Ahaz’s upper chamber, which the kings of Judah had made. And he destroyed the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the house of the Lord. He ran from there, broke them into pieces, ground them to dust, and scattered the dust over the Kidron stream.
2 Kings 23:13 The king also defiled the high places that were in Jerusalem, on the right side of the Mount of Corruption—meaning, the Mount of Olives. These had been built by King Solomon of Israel for Ashtoreth, the idol of the Sidonians; for Chemosh, the idol of the Moabites; and for Molech, the idol of the Ammonites.
2 Kings 23:14 He smashed the pagan pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with the bones of the dead—an act of severe defilement.
2 Kings 23:15 Moreover, he also tore down the altar in Bethel and the high place that Jeroboam son of Nebat had built, the one who caused Israel to sin. He overthrew that altar and that high place. He burned the high place, ground it to dust, and burned the Asherah pole.
2 Kings 23:16 Then Josiah turned and saw the tombs that were on the mountain there. He sent men to take the bones from the tombs, and he burned them on the altar, thus defiling it, just as the word of the Lord had declared through the man of God who had prophesied these very things.
2 Kings 23:17 He asked, 'What is that monument I see?' The men of the city answered him, 'It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and foretold these very things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.'
2 Kings 23:18 And he said, 'Leave him alone; let no one disturb his bones.' So his bones remained untouched, along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
2 Kings 23:19 Moreover, Josiah also removed all the shrines of the high places in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger. He dealt with them in the same way he had dealt with all the works he did in Bethel.
2 Kings 23:20 He slaughtered all the priests of the high places who were there, sacrificing them on their own altars, and he burned human bones upon those altars to defile them thoroughly. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2 Kings 23:21 Then the king commanded all the people, saying, 'Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, according to what is written in this book of the covenant.'
2 Kings 23:22 Indeed, no such Passover had been celebrated from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel or the kings of Judah,
2 Kings 23:23 as it was observed for the Lord in Jerusalem in the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign.
2 Kings 23:24 Furthermore, Josiah also removed the mediums, the spiritists, the household idols, the pagan images, and all the detestable things that had been in the land of Judah and Jerusalem. He did this to fulfill the words of the Law that were written in the book which Hilkiah the priest had found in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 23:25 Before him, there was no king like him, who turned back to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.
2 Kings 23:26 Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn away from the fierceness of His great wrath, with which He was angry against Judah because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him.
2 Kings 23:27 And the Lord said, 'I will also remove Judah from my sight, just as I removed Israel. I will cast away this city of Jerusalem, which I chose, and the house about which I said, 'My Name shall be there.''
2 Kings 23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 23:29 In his days, Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria to the Euphrates River. King Josiah went out to meet him, and Pharaoh Necho killed him at Megiddo the moment he saw him.
2 Kings 23:30 His servants carried his dead body from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, Josiah's son, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.
2 Kings 23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
2 Kings 23:32 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his fathers had done.
2 Kings 23:33 Pharaoh Necho imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath, so that he could not reign in Jerusalem. And Pharaoh imposed a tax on the land: one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.
2 Kings 23:34 Pharaoh Necho then made Eliakim, Josiah's son, king in place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. As for Jehoahaz, Pharaoh took him and brought him to Egypt, where he died.
2 Kings 23:35 Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, after he had heavily taxed the land to pay the money according to Pharaoh's command. He exacted the silver and gold from each person according to their means, taking it from the people of the land to give to Pharaoh Necho.
2 Kings 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah, daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah.
2 Kings 23:37 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his fathers had done.
2 Kings 23:38 In Jehoiakim’s days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him again.
2 Kings 23:39 And the Lord sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, raiding bands of Syrians, raiding bands of Moabites, and raiding bands of the Ammonites. He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord which He had spoken through His servants, the prophets.
2 Kings 23:40 Indeed, this came to pass in Judah according to the word of the Lord, so that He might remove them from His presence because of all the sins of Manasseh that he had committed.
2 Kings 23:1 So the king sent out messengers and gathered to himself all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Kings 23:2 And the king went up to the Temple of the Lord. All the men of Judah, everyone found in Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people—from the least to the greatest—went with him. Then the king read, while everyone listened, all the words of the covenant book that had been found in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 23:3 The king stood on his royal platform and made a solemn covenant before the Lord: that they would walk after the Lord and keep His commandments, His testimonies, and His statutes with all their heart and all their soul. They also promised to confirm the words of this covenant, which were written in this book. And all the people agreed to this covenant.
2 Kings 23:4 Then the king commanded Hilkiah, the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers to remove from the Temple of the Lord all the vessels that had been made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of the sky. He burned these items outside Jerusalem, in the Kidron Valley, and carried their ashes to Bethel.
2 Kings 23:5 He removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense at the high places throughout the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem. He also removed those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the twelve constellations of the zodiac, and to all the host of the sky.
2 Kings 23:6 He had the Asherah poles brought out from the Temple of the Lord, outside Jerusalem into the Kidron Valley. There he burned them, ground them to powder, and scattered the powder over the graves of the common people.
2 Kings 23:7 He also tore down the living quarters of the male prostitutes, those who served false gods, which were in the Temple of the Lord, where women wove garments, like small shelters for idols.
2 Kings 23:8 He gathered all the priests from the cities of Judah. He desecrated the high places where the priests had offered sacrifices, from Geba to Beer-sheba. He also tore down the altars at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which was to the left of the city gate.
2 Kings 23:9 However, the priests of the high places were not permitted to ascend to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem. Instead, they ate unleavened bread among their fellow priests.
2 Kings 23:10 He also desecrated Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, so that no one could consecrate his son or his daughter by passing them through fire to Moloch.
2 Kings 23:11 He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun god, at the entrance to the Temple of the Lord, near the chamber of Nathan-melech, the eunuch who was in charge of the courtyards. And the chariots of the sun god he burned with fire.
2 Kings 23:12 The altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the Temple of the Lord—these the king destroyed. He quickly ran and broke them down from that place and brought their ashes to the Kidron torrent.
2 Kings 23:13 The high places that were in Jerusalem, on the right side of the Mount of Offense, which Solomon, king of Israel, had built for Ashtoreth, the idol of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh, the idol of the Moabites, and for Milcom (Moloch), the idol of the Ammonites—these the king desecrated.
2 Kings 23:14 He broke the sacred pillars into pieces and cut down the Asherah poles. Then he filled their places with the bones of the dead.
2 Kings 23:15 Furthermore, the altar that was in Bethel, and the high place that Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, had made—he who caused Israel to sin—both that altar and that high place Josiah destroyed. He burned it, crushed it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole as well.
2 Kings 23:16 Then Josiah turned and saw the tombs that were there on the mountain. He sent men, took the bones from the tombs, and burned them on the altar, thereby desecrating it, just as the word of the Lord had declared through the man of God who had proclaimed these words long ago.
2 Kings 23:17 And he asked, 'What is that monument I see there?' The men of the city replied to him, 'It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and announced these very things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.'
2 Kings 23:18 Josiah said, 'Leave him alone. Let no one disturb his bones.' So his bones remained untouched, along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
2 Kings 23:19 Moreover, all the shrines of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah removed. He did to them exactly as he had done in Bethel.
2 Kings 23:20 He sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there on the altars, and he burned human bones upon them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
2 Kings 23:21 The king commanded all the people, saying, 'Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in this covenant book.'
2 Kings 23:22 For such a Passover had not been celebrated since the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel or the kings of Judah.
2 Kings 23:23 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign, this Passover was celebrated to the Lord in Jerusalem with great devotion.
2 Kings 23:24 Furthermore, Josiah abolished the mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, and all the abominations that were found in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. He did this to uphold the words of the law that were written in the book which Hilkiah the priest found in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 23:25 There was no king like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses. Nor did any like him arise after him.
2 Kings 23:26 Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn away from the fierceness of His great wrath, with which His anger burned against Judah because of all the provocations by which Manasseh had provoked Him.
2 Kings 23:27 And the Lord said, 'I will also remove Judah from my presence, just as I removed Israel. I will cast away this city of Jerusalem, which I chose, and the house about which I said, 'My Name shall be there.''
2 Kings 23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 23:29 In his days, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went up to attack the king of Assyria by the Euphrates River. King Josiah went out to meet him in battle, and when Josiah saw him, he was killed at Megiddo.
2 Kings 23:30 His servants carried his dead body from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, Josiah's son, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.
2 Kings 23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
2 Kings 23:32 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his fathers had done.
2 Kings 23:33 Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, so that he could not reign in Jerusalem. He also imposed a fine on the land: one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.
2 Kings 23:34 Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim, Josiah's son, king in place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. As for Jehoahaz, Pharaoh took him away to Egypt, and he died there.
2 Kings 23:35 Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh after he had levied the amount from each person according to their means. He exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land to give to Pharaoh Neco.
2 Kings 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zebidah, daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah.
2 Kings 23:37 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his fathers had done.
2 Kings 23:38 In his days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. Then he rebelled against him again.
2 Kings 23:39 The Lord sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, bands of Syrians, bands of Moabites, and bands of the Ammonites' sons. He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through His servants the prophets.
2 Kings 23:40 For indeed, this happened in Judah according to the word of the Lord, that He might remove them from His presence because of all the sins of Manasseh and all that he had done.
2 Kings 23:1 So King Josiah sent out orders, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him.
2 Kings 23:2 The king then went up to the Temple of the Lord, God’s holy dwelling, and with him were all the men of Judah, and everyone who was found in Jerusalem—the priests, the prophets, and all the people, from the youngest to the oldest. He read aloud for all to hear all the words of the book of the covenant, the rediscovered ancient law of God, which had been found in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 23:3 The king stood by the pillar and made a solemn covenant before the Lord, promising that he and his people would walk after the Lord, and would keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His sacred rites with all their heart and with all their soul. They vowed to confirm all the words of this covenant which were written in this book. And all the people confirmed their agreement to the covenant.
2 Kings 23:4 The king then commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second rank who assisted him, and the Temple doorkeepers, to remove from the Temple of the Lord all the items that had been made for the worship of Baal, and for the goddess Asherah, and for the worship of all the celestial bodies—the host of heaven. Josiah had these items burned outside Jerusalem in the Kidron Valley, a place of defilement, and had their ashes carried to Bethel, a site historically associated with Israelite idolatry.
2 Kings 23:5 He then removed the pagan priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense on the high places, in the cities of Judah, and in the areas around Jerusalem. These priests had burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the twelve constellations of the zodiac, and to all the celestial bodies—the host of heaven.
2 Kings 23:6 He brought the Asherah pole, an idolatrous cult object, out from the Temple of the Lord to the Kidron Valley in Jerusalem. There he burned it, ground it into dust, and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people, further defiling it.
2 Kings 23:7 He also tore down the living quarters of the male cult prostitutes, which were located within the Temple of the Lord, where women wove hangings for the Asherah.
2 Kings 23:8 Josiah then brought all the priests from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem. He defiled the high places where these priests had offered sacrifices, from Geba in the north all the way to Beersheba in the south. He also demolished the altars at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which was to the left of the city gate.
2 Kings 23:9 However, those priests who had served at the high places were not permitted to ascend to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem; instead, they were only allowed to eat unleavened bread among their fellow priests, but not participate in the sacred Temple rituals.
2 Kings 23:10 He also defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to prevent anyone from consecrating their son or daughter by passing them through fire as a sacrifice to the pagan god Moloch. This practice of child sacrifice was abolished.
2 Kings 23:11 He removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun god, which were at the entrance of the Temple of the Lord, near the chamber of Nathan-Melech, the eunuch who was in charge of the sacred courtyard. He also burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
2 Kings 23:12 The altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had built, and the altars that Manasseh had built in the two courtyards of the Temple of the Lord, these the king tore down. He quickly broke them into pieces and scattered their dust into the Kidron Valley.
2 Kings 23:13 King Josiah also defiled the high places that were opposite Jerusalem, to the right of the Mount of Offence—also known as the Mount of Olives. These had been built by Solomon, the king of Israel, for Ashtoreth, the detestable idol of the Sidonians; for Chemosh, the detestable idol of Moab; and for Milcom, the detestable idol of the Ammonites. Josiah rendered these sites unusable for worship.
2 Kings 23:14 He smashed the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled their places with the bones of the dead, further desecrating these pagan sites.
2 Kings 23:15 Furthermore, Josiah destroyed the altar at Bethel and the high place that Jeroboam son of Nebat had made, the very one who led Israel into sin. He pulled down that altar and the high place, burned them, crushed them to dust, and also burned the Asherah pole.
2 Kings 23:16 As Josiah turned around, he saw the tombs that were on the mountain nearby. He sent and took the bones from those tombs, then burned them on the altar, thus defiling it. This action fulfilled the word of the Lord that had been spoken by the man of God, the prophet who had foretold these very events.
2 Kings 23:17 And Josiah asked: 'What is that monument I see there?' The people of the city answered him: 'It is the tomb of the man of God, a prophet who came from Judah and foretold these very things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.'
2 Kings 23:18 So Josiah said: 'Leave him be; let no one disturb his bones.' Thus, his bones were left undisturbed, along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
2 Kings 23:19 Josiah also removed all the shrines of the high places in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had built to provoke the Lord to anger. He dealt with them in the same manner as all the things he had done in Bethel, thoroughly destroying them.
2 Kings 23:20 He sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there, offering them on their own altars. He also burned human bones on those altars, further desecrating them. After these purifications, Josiah returned to Jerusalem.
2 Kings 23:21 Then King Josiah commanded all the people, saying: 'Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, exactly as it is written in this book of the covenant.'
2 Kings 23:22 Indeed, such a Passover had not been celebrated from the days when the judges ruled Israel, nor during all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.
2 Kings 23:23 It was in the eighteenth year of King Josiah’s reign that this Passover was celebrated for the Lord in Jerusalem, a celebration of unparalleled devotion.
2 Kings 23:24 Moreover, Josiah removed all the mediums who consulted the dead, the spiritists, the household idols known as teraphim, the detestable false gods, and all the other abominations that had been present in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. He did this to establish the words of the Law that were written in the book which Hilkiah the priest had found in the Temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 23:25 No king before him had turned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses. Nor did any like him arise after him. Josiah’s devotion was truly exceptional.
2 Kings 23:26 Nevertheless, the Lord did not turn away from the great fierceness of His burning anger, with which His wrath had been kindled against Judah because of all the provocations that Manasseh, a former king, had caused.
2 Kings 23:27 So the Lord said: 'I will also remove Judah from My presence, just as I removed Israel, the northern kingdom. I will cast away this city of Jerusalem, which I chose, and the Temple, about which I said: My Name shall be there.' This signified a complete rejection due to the people's persistent sin.
2 Kings 23:28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are these not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 23:29 In those days, Pharaoh Necho, the king of Egypt, went up to attack the king of Assyria by the Euphrates River. King Josiah went out to confront him, and was killed at Megiddo as soon as he saw him in battle.
2 Kings 23:30 His servants carried his dead body from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem, where they buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, Josiah’s son, anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.
2 Kings 23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
2 Kings 23:32 He did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his predecessors, his fathers, had done.
2 Kings 23:33 Then Pharaoh Necho imprisoned him at Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath, to prevent him from reigning in Jerusalem. The Pharaoh also imposed a tribute on the land: one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.
2 Kings 23:34 Pharaoh Necho then made Eliakim, Josiah’s son, king in place of his father Josiah, and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. As for Jehoahaz, Necho took him away to Egypt, and he died there.
2 Kings 23:35 Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh the silver and gold he demanded, collecting it by imposing a tax on each person according to their means. He exacted the money from the people of the land and gave it to Pharaoh Necho.
2 Kings 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah.
2 Kings 23:37 He did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as all his predecessors, his fathers, had done.
2 Kings 23:38 In his days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against Jerusalem. Jehoiakim became his servant for three years, but then he rebelled against him.
2 Kings 23:39 And the Lord sent against him raiding parties of the Chaldeans, and raiding parties of the Syrians, and raiding parties of the Moabites, and raiding parties of the Ammonites. He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through His servants the prophets.
2 Kings 23:40 Indeed, this came upon Judah by the anger of the Lord, so that He might remove them from His presence because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done.
2 Kings 24:1 In those days, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched on Judah, and Jehoiakim, king of Judah, became his vassal for three years, but then Jehoiakim rebelled against him.
2 Kings 24:2 And the Lord God sent against Jehoiakim raiding parties of Chaldeans, and raiding parties of Syrians, and raiding parties of Moabites, and raiding parties of the Ammonites. He sent them into Judah to destroy it, just as the Lord God had declared through His servants, the prophets.
2 Kings 24:3 This happened in Judah precisely as the Lord God had declared: He removed them from His sight because of all the sins of Manasseh, everything that Manasseh had done,
2 Kings 24:4 and because of the innocent blood that Manasseh had shed, filling Jerusalem with innocent blood. Because of this, the Lord God refused to forgive them.
2 Kings 24:5 All the other deeds of Jehoiakim, and everything he did, are they not written in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?
2 Kings 24:6 Jehoiakim died and was buried with his ancestors. Then his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place.
2 Kings 24:7 And the king of Egypt never again left his own territory, because the king of Babylon had taken all the lands that once belonged to the king of Egypt, from the Brook of Egypt all the way to the Euphrates River.
2 Kings 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for three months. His mother's name was Nehushta, daughter of Elnathan, from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 24:9 And Jehoiachin did evil in the sight of the Lord God, just as his father had done.
2 Kings 24:10 At that time, the army of the king of Babylon marched up to Jerusalem, and the city was put under siege.
2 Kings 24:11 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon himself came to the city while his servants were besieging it.
2 Kings 24:12 So Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, surrendered to the king of Babylon—he, his mother, his servants, his princes, and his eunuchs all surrendered. The king of Babylon accepted his surrender in the eighth year of his own reign.
2 Kings 24:13 Nebuchadnezzar carried away all the treasures from the House of the Lord God and all the treasures from the king's palace. He also cut into pieces all the golden vessels that King Solomon of Israel had made for the Temple of the Lord God, just as the Lord God had declared.
2 Kings 24:14 He deported all of Jerusalem's inhabitants, all the leaders, and all the mighty warriors—ten thousand of them into captivity. He also took every craftsman and every blacksmith, leaving behind only the poorest people of the land.
2 Kings 24:15 Nebuchadnezzar also deported Jehoiachin to Babylon, along with the king's mother, the king's wives, his eunuchs, and all the powerful men of the land were taken captive from Jerusalem to Babylon.
2 Kings 24:16 And all the strong men, numbering seven thousand, and a thousand craftsmen and blacksmiths—all of them strong and capable warriors—the king of Babylon brought them as captives to Babylon.
2 Kings 24:17 And the king of Babylon then made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his place, changing his name to Zedekiah.
2 Kings 24:18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
2 Kings 24:19 And Zedekiah did evil in the sight of the Lord God, just as Jehoiakim had done.
2 Kings 24:20 For the Lord God was so angry with Jerusalem and with Judah that He eventually cast them out from His sight. Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon.
2 Kings 25:1 It happened in the ninth year of King Sedecias’ reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem with his entire army. They surrounded the city and built siege works all around it.
2 Kings 25:2 The city remained under siege until the eleventh year of King Sedecias’ reign.
2 Kings 25:3 On the ninth day of that month, a severe famine gripped the city, and the people of the land had no bread left to eat.
2 Kings 25:4 The city’s defenses were breached, and all the fighting men fled by night through the gate between the two walls that led to the king’s garden. The Chaldeans were surrounding the city at this point. The king himself escaped by way of the plain.
2 Kings 25:5 The Chaldean army pursued the king and captured him in the desert plains near Jericho. All the soldiers who had been with him were scattered away from him.
2 Kings 25:6 So, the captured king was brought to the king of Babylon in Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath. There, Nebuchadnezzar pronounced judgment against him.
2 Kings 25:7 Nebuchadnezzar then killed Sedecias’ sons right before his eyes. After that, he gouged out Sedecias’ eyes, bound him with bronze chains, and took him to Babylon.
2 Kings 25:8 In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month—which was the nineteenth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon—Nabuzardan, the commander of the royal guard and a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
2 Kings 25:9 He set fire to the Temple of the Lord, the king’s palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building was burned down.
2 Kings 25:10 The entire Chaldean army, who were with the commander of the royal guard, tore down the walls of Jerusalem all around the city.
2 Kings 25:11 Nabuzardan, the commander of the royal guard, carried away into exile the rest of the people who had remained in the city, along with those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and all the other common people.
2 Kings 25:12 However, the commander of the royal guard left behind some of the poorest people of the land to be vine dressers and farmers.
2 Kings 25:13 The Chaldeans also broke into pieces the bronze pillars that were in the Temple of the Lord, as well as the movable stands and the great bronze basin known as the Sea, which was also in the Lord's Temple. They carried all the bronze from these items away to Babylon.
2 Kings 25:14 They also took away the bronze pots, shovels, snuffers, ladles, and all the other bronze vessels used in the Temple service.
2 Kings 25:15 The commander of the royal guard also took away the fire pans and the sprinkling bowls, distinguishing those made of solid gold and those made of solid silver.
2 Kings 25:16 As for the two pillars, the one great Sea, and the movable stands that Solomon had made for the Temple of the Lord, the amount of bronze in all these vessels was immeasurable.
2 Kings 25:17 Each pillar was eighteen cubits high, with a bronze capital three cubits high on top. Over the capital, there was bronze lattice work and pomegranates, all made of bronze. The second pillar was identical to this one.
2 Kings 25:18 The commander of the royal guard also took away Saraias, the chief priest, Sophonias, the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.
2 Kings 25:19 From the city, he took one eunuch who was in charge of the fighting men; five men who served as the king's close advisors, whom he found in the city; Sopher, the commander of the army; and sixty men from the common people of the land, who were also found in the city.
2 Kings 25:20 Nabuzardan, the commander of the royal guard, took all these men and brought them to the king of Babylon in Riblah.
2 Kings 25:21 There, in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death. So, Judah was carried away from its own land into exile.
2 Kings 25:22 As for the people who had been left behind in the land of Judah, those whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had permitted to remain, he appointed Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, over them.
2 Kings 25:23 When all the army commanders—they and their men—heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Godolias as governor, they came to Godolias in Maspha. These were Ismael, son of Nathanias; Joanan, son of Caree; Sarea, son of Thanehumeth the Netophathite; and Jezonias, son of Maachati, along with their companions.
2 Kings 25:24 Godolias swore an oath to them and their companions, saying: 'Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you.'
2 Kings 25:25 However, in the seventh month, Ismael, the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama, who was of royal lineage, came with ten men. They struck down Godolias, who died, and also killed the Jews and Chaldeans who were with him in Maspha.
2 Kings 25:26 Then all the people, from the least to the greatest, along with the army commanders, were afraid. So they rose up and went to Egypt, fearing the Chaldeans’ retaliation.
2 Kings 25:27 It happened in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Joachin, the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month. Evilmerodach, the king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, released Joachin, the king of Judah, from prison.
2 Kings 25:28 Evilmerodach spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
2 Kings 25:29 Joachin was allowed to change out of his prison clothes, and he was given food to eat continually in the king’s presence for the rest of his life.
2 Kings 25:30 The king also provided him with a regular daily allowance of food for the remaining days of his life, until his death.

1 Chronicles 5:2 The reason for this change in the birthright was that from Judah came mighty men, and from him arose the leader of the people—the royal family, that is—and he was not reckoned as the firstborn according to his genealogy, but according to God's choice for leadership.

1 Chronicles 5:21 They carried away as plunder their livestock: fifty thousand camels, two hundred fifty thousand sheep, two thousand donkeys, and one hundred thousand people as captives.
1 Chronicles 5:22 Many of their enemies were killed because the battle was fought under God's righteous judgment. And the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh lived in their place until the time of the exile.
1 Chronicles 5:23 The sons of the half-tribe of Manasseh possessed the land from Bashan to Baal-Hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon, for they had become very numerous.
1 Chronicles 5:24 These were the chiefs of their family divisions in the half-tribe of Manasseh: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were brave and powerful men, well-known leaders of their respective families.

1 Chronicles 9:18 Until now, they were the gatekeepers at the King's Gate, which is to the east, serving in their assigned shifts, these sons of Levi.
1 Chronicles 9:19 Furthermore, Shallum, son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah—with his brothers and his father's household, the Korahites—they were in charge of the work of the ministry, as guardians of the thresholds of the tabernacle. And their family lines, in their assigned shifts, were responsible for guarding the Lord's encampment.
1 Chronicles 9:20 Now Phinehas, son of Eleazar, was their leader before the Lord.
1 Chronicles 9:21 And Zechariah, son of Meshelemiah, was the gatekeeper of the entrance to the Tabernacle of the Covenant.

1 Chronicles 9:23 Both they themselves and their sons were responsible for guarding the entrances to the Lord's tabernacle.
1 Chronicles 9:24 The gatekeepers were stationed at the four cardinal directions: to the east, west, north, and south.
1 Chronicles 9:25 Their brothers lived in their own villages so that they could come every seven days and take their shift with them.
1 Chronicles 9:26 For these were the chief gatekeepers from the Levitical lineage, holding their positions by trust. They were also in charge of the treasuries, and of the sacred treasures.

1 Chronicles 10:1 So then, the Philistines were fighting against Israel. The Israelite soldiers fled from the Philistines and fell, wounded, on Mount Gilboa.
1 Chronicles 10:2 The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons, and they struck down Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchisua, who were Saul's sons.
1 Chronicles 10:3 The battle intensified against Saul, and the archers found him and wounded him with their arrows.
1 Chronicles 10:4 Saul then said to his armor-bearer: 'Draw your sword and run me through, so that these uncircumcised enemies (the Philistines, viewed with religious contempt by the Israelites) don't come and mock me.' But his armor-bearer refused, utterly terrified.
1 Chronicles 10:5 So Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
1 Chronicles 10:6 When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his own sword and died.
1 Chronicles 10:7 Now all the Israelites who lived in the valleys, upon seeing that the Israelite soldiers had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, abandoned their cities and every location, and fled. Then the Philistines came and settled there.
1 Chronicles 10:8 So on the next day, the Philistines came to strip the dead, and they found Saul and his sons lying on Mount Gilboa.
1 Chronicles 10:9 They cut off his head and stripped him of his armor, and sent them throughout the land of the Philistines (to publicly announce their victory), to be displayed among the temples of their idols and to be shown to their own people.
1 Chronicles 10:10 They placed Saul's armor in the temple of Astaroth (a pagan goddess), and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon (a pagan god).
1 Chronicles 10:11 When all the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard this about everything the Philistines had done to Saul (their former deliverer),
1 Chronicles 10:12 All the bravest men rose up and took the bodies of Saul and his sons. They brought them to Jabesh and buried their bones under the oak tree that was in Jabesh. And they fasted for seven days (in mourning).
1 Chronicles 10:13 So Saul died because of his sins: because he had transgressed the command of the Lord, which he had not kept, and moreover, he had even consulted a witch (a diviner, a practice forbidden by God).
1 Chronicles 10:14 and had not trusted in the Lord. Therefore, the Lord killed him and transferred his kingdom to David, the son of Jesse.
1 Chronicles 11:1 So then, all of Israel gathered to David in Hebron, saying, "Behold, we are your bone and your flesh," meaning we are your family and kin.
1 Chronicles 11:2 Even long ago, while Saul was still reigning, you were the one who led Israel out to battle and brought them back. And the Lord your God told you: "You shall shepherd My people Israel, and you shall be their chosen leader."
1 Chronicles 11:3 So then, all the elders of Israel came to the king in Hebron. And David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed him king over Israel, just as the Lord had spoken through Samuel.
1 Chronicles 11:4 Then David and all of Israel went to Jerusalem—which is also called Jebus, where the Jebusites were living in the land.
1 Chronicles 11:5 But the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, "You shall not enter here!" Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Sion, which is now known as the City of David.
1 Chronicles 11:6 David had said earlier, "Whoever strikes down a Jebusite first will be made chief and a commander." So Joab, the son of Sarvia, went up first, and he became the chief.
1 Chronicles 11:7 And David lived in that stronghold, which is why it was called the City of David.
1 Chronicles 11:8 And David built up the city all around, from Millo and extending in a circle. Meanwhile, Joab restored the rest of the city.
1 Chronicles 11:9 And David became very great, continually growing and becoming more prominent, for the Lord of hosts was with him.
1 Chronicles 11:10 These also are the chiefs of David's mighty men, who helped him become king over all of Israel, in accordance with the word of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 11:11 And this is the number of David's mighty men: Jasobaam, the son of Hachamoni, who was chief among the thirty. He lifted his spear against three hundred men and wounded them all at one time.
1 Chronicles 11:12 After him was Eleazar, the son of his uncle Dodo the Ahohite, who was among the three most powerful.
1 Chronicles 11:13 He was with David at Pas Dammim, when the Philistines gathered for battle. And the field was full of Philistines, and there was a field of barley there.
1 Chronicles 11:14 When the people had fled from the Philistines, Eleazar stood in the middle of the field and delivered it from the enemy. He struck down the Philistines, and the Lord saved them with a great salvation through Eleazar's action.
1 Chronicles 11:15 Moreover, three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock where David was, in the cave of Adullam, while the Philistines were camped in the Valley of Rephaim.
1 Chronicles 11:16 David was then in the stronghold, and a garrison of Philistines was in Bethlehem.
1 Chronicles 11:17 So David longed for something and said, "Oh, if only someone would give me water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"
1 Chronicles 11:18 And the three mighty men broke through the middle of the Philistine camp and drew water from the well of Bethlehem, which was by the gate, and brought it to David. But he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as a libation to the Lord.
1 Chronicles 11:19 David said, "Far be it from me to do this in the sight of my God! Shall I drink the blood of these men? For at the risk of their very lives they brought this water to me." And for this reason, he refused to drink it. These were the acts of the three most mighty men.
1 Chronicles 11:20 Abisai, Joab's brother, was also chief of the three. He himself lifted his spear against three hundred men and killed them, and he had as great a reputation among the three as the others.
1 Chronicles 11:21 Among the three, he was second and more renowned, and he was like a leader to them. Nevertheless, he did not attain to the fame of the first three.
1 Chronicles 11:22 Banaias, the son of Jojada, a most courageous man from Cabseel, accomplished many great deeds. He struck down two lion-like men of Moab, and he himself went down into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day.
1 Chronicles 11:23 He also killed an Egyptian of incredible stature, who had a spear in his hand like a weaver's beam. Banaias went down to him with only a staff, took the spear from him, and killed him with his own spear.
1 Chronicles 11:24 These things Banaias, the son of Jojada, accomplished, and he was renowned among the three most powerful men.
1 Chronicles 11:25 He was chief among the thirty, yet he did not attain to the fame of the first three. But David appointed him to his inner circle, meaning he became a close and trusted advisor.
1 Chronicles 11:26 Now the bravest men of the army were Asahel, Joab's brother, and Elchanan, the son of his uncle Dodo from Bethlehem,
1 Chronicles 11:27 Sammoth the Harorite, Helles the Pelonite,
1 Chronicles 11:28 Ira, the son of Acces the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
1 Chronicles 11:29 Sobochai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
1 Chronicles 11:30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled, the son of Baana the Netophathite,
1 Chronicles 11:31 Ittai, the son of Ribai, from Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Banaia the Pirathonite,
1 Chronicles 11:32 Hurai from the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
1 Chronicles 11:33 Azmoth the Baharumite, Eliaba the Shaalbonite,
1 Chronicles 11:34 The sons of Assan the Gizonite, Jonathan, the son of Sage the Hararite,
1 Chronicles 11:35 Ahiam, the son of Sachar the Hararite, Eliphal, the son of Ur,
1 Chronicles 11:36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahia the Pelonite,
1 Chronicles 11:37 Hesro the Carmelite, Naarai, the son of Azbai,
1 Chronicles 11:38 Joel, Nathan's brother, Mibahar, the son of Hagri,
1 Chronicles 11:39 Selec the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, who was the armor-bearer for Joab, the son of Sarvia,
1 Chronicles 11:40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite.
1 Chronicles 12:1 These are the ones who came to David in Ziklag while he was still fleeing King Saul, the son of Kish. These men were very strong and excellent fighters.
1 Chronicles 12:2 They were skilled with the bow and could sling stones and shoot arrows with either hand. These men were even from Saul’s own kinsmen, from the tribe of Benjamin.
1 Chronicles 12:3 The chief Aheizer, and Joas, sons of Samaa, from Gibeah; also Jaziel and Pheleth, sons of Azmoth; and Baracha and Jehu from Anathoth.
1 Chronicles 12:4 There was also Samaia from Gibeon, who was the strongest among the thirty, and even above them in command. From Gederah were Jeremias, Jeheziel, Johanan, and Jozabad.
1 Chronicles 12:5 Eluzai, Jerimuth, Baalia, Samaria, and Sephatia, all Haruphites.
1 Chronicles 12:6 Celcana, Jesia, Azareel, Joezer, and Jasabaam, all Carithites.
1 Chronicles 12:7 And Joela and Zabadia, the sons of Jeroham, from Gedor.
1 Chronicles 12:8 And from the tribe of Gad, men also deserted to David when he was hiding out in the desert. They were very strong men and excellent warriors, bearing shields and spears. Their faces were as fierce as lions, and they were as swift as gazelles on the mountains.
1 Chronicles 12:9 Ezer was their chief, Obadias was second in command, and Eliab was third.
1 Chronicles 12:10 Masmana was fourth, and Jeremias was fifth.
1 Chronicles 12:11 Ethi was sixth, and Eliel was seventh.
1 Chronicles 12:12 Johanan was eighth, and Elzebad was ninth.
1 Chronicles 12:13 Jeremias was tenth, and Machbanai was eleventh.
1 Chronicles 12:14 These men from the sons of Gad were commanders in the army. The least capable among them commanded a hundred soldiers, and the greatest among them commanded a thousand.
1 Chronicles 12:15 These were the men who crossed the Jordan River in the first month of the year, when the waters overflowed its banks due to the spring floods. They drove away everyone who was dwelling in the valleys, on both the eastern and western sides.
1 Chronicles 12:16 Some men also came from Benjamin and Judah to the strongholds where David was staying.
1 Chronicles 12:17 David went out to meet them and said: "If you have come to me peacefully to help me, then my heart will be united with you. But if you are here to betray me to my adversaries—even though I have done no wrong—then may the God of our fathers see it and judge you."
1 Chronicles 12:18 Then the Spirit of God empowered Amasai, who was a chief among the thirty, and he said: "We are yours, O David, and we are with you, son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to all who help you, for your God truly helps you." So David received them and made them commanders of his troops.
1 Chronicles 12:19 Furthermore, some men from the tribe of Manasseh also deserted to David when he was coming with the Philistines to fight against Saul. But David did not actually fight with the Philistines, because the Philistine princes, after careful deliberation, sent him away, saying, "He will surely turn back to his master Saul at the cost of our lives, endangering us."
1 Chronicles 12:20 Therefore, when David returned to Ziklag, men from Manasseh deserted to him: Ednas, Jozabad, Jediel, Michael, Jozabad, Eliu, and Silthai. These were commanders of thousands within the tribe of Manasseh.
1 Chronicles 12:21 These men helped David against the marauders, for they were all very strong men and became commanders in David's army.
1 Chronicles 12:22 And indeed, day by day, more men came to David, as if to offer help, until his army became very great—as numerous and formidable as the army of God Himself.
1 Chronicles 12:23 This is the number of the commanders of the army who came to David in Hebron to transfer the kingdom from Saul to him, just as the Lord had promised.
1 Chronicles 12:24 From the sons of Judah, bearing shield and spear, there were six thousand eight hundred men, ready for battle.
1 Chronicles 12:25 From the sons of Simeon, seven thousand one hundred very strong men, ready for battle.
1 Chronicles 12:26 From the sons of Levi, four thousand six hundred.
1 Chronicles 12:27 And Jojada, a chief from the family of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred men.
1 Chronicles 12:28 And also Zadok, an excellent young man, came from the household of his father, bringing with him twenty-two commanders.
1 Chronicles 12:29 And from the sons of Benjamin, who were Saul's kinsmen, three thousand men came. This was significant because many more of the Benjaminites were still loyal to Saul’s household.
1 Chronicles 12:30 Furthermore, from the sons of Ephraim, there were twenty thousand eight hundred very strong men, each one distinguished by his reputation.
1 Chronicles 12:31 And from the half-tribe of Manasseh, eighteen thousand men came, each one specifically named and recognized, to make David king.
1 Chronicles 12:32 From the sons of Issachar, there were men who understood the times, so that they knew exactly what Israel ought to do. Their commanders were two hundred, and the rest of their tribe followed their command.
1 Chronicles 12:33 Furthermore, from the tribe of Zebulun, there were fifty thousand men, ready to go out to battle and stand in formation, fully equipped with all military weapons. They helped David with sincere and undivided hearts.
1 Chronicles 12:34 And from Naphtali, there were one thousand commanders, and with them thirty-seven thousand armed men ready for battle.
1 Chronicles 12:35 And from Dan also, twenty-eight thousand six hundred men, ready for battle.
1 Chronicles 12:36 And from Asher, forty thousand men who were going out to battle and prepared for war.
1 Chronicles 12:37 From beyond the Jordan River, from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, there were one hundred twenty thousand men, fully equipped with all the weapons of war.
1 Chronicles 12:38 All these warriors, ready for battle and fighting in formation, came to Hebron with complete devotion to make David king over all Israel. Indeed, all the rest of Israel were of one accord and unanimous in their decision to make David king.
1 Chronicles 12:39 They were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren in the region had prepared an abundant feast for them.
1 Chronicles 12:40 Moreover, even those who lived near them, reaching as far as the tribes of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, were bringing provisions on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen for them to eat: an abundance of flour, figs, raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep. For there was indeed great joy throughout Israel.
1 Chronicles 13:1 Then David consulted with all the leaders of Israel: the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds.
1 Chronicles 13:2 He spoke to the entire assembly of Israel, saying: "If it pleases you, and if this plan is truly from the Lord our God, let us send messengers to the rest of our brothers throughout all the lands of Israel. Let us also send for the priests and Levites who live in the outlying settlements of the cities, so they may gather to us."
1 Chronicles 13:3 "And let us bring the Ark of our God here to us, because during the days of Saul, we did not faithfully seek its presence."
1 Chronicles 13:4 The entire multitude responded that this should be done, for the plan was pleasing to all the people.
1 Chronicles 13:5 So David gathered all of Israel, from the Nile River in Egypt all the way to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
1 Chronicles 13:6 David and all Israel then went up to the city of Kiriath-jearim, which is in Judah, to bring from there the Ark of the Lord God—the one enthroned above the Cherubim, where His sacred Name had been invoked.
1 Chronicles 13:7 They placed the Ark of God on a new cart, taken from Abinadab’s house. Uzzah and his brothers were driving this cart.
1 Chronicles 13:8 David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, with songs, lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
1 Chronicles 13:9 When they reached the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah extended his hand to steady the Ark, because the oxen had stumbled and nearly overturned it.
1 Chronicles 13:10 The Lord became angry with Uzzah and struck him down because he had touched the Ark, and Uzzah died there before the Lord.
1 Chronicles 13:11 David was deeply distressed that the Lord had broken out against Uzzah. So he named that place "The Striking of Uzzah"—a name it bears to this very day.
1 Chronicles 13:12 David greatly feared God on that day, saying: "How can I possibly bring the Ark of God into my own dwelling?"
1 Chronicles 13:13 For this reason, David did not bring the Ark of God into his own city. Instead, he diverted it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
1 Chronicles 13:14 So the Ark of God remained in Obed-Edom’s house for three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-Edom's household and everything he owned.
1 Chronicles 14:1 Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber, and skilled masons for building walls, and skilled carpenters for working with wood, so they could build a palace for him.
1 Chronicles 14:2 David then understood that the Lord had established him as king over all of Israel, and had raised his kingdom for the good of his people, Israel.
1 Chronicles 14:3 David also took more wives in Jerusalem and fathered more sons and daughters.
1 Chronicles 14:4 These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
1 Chronicles 14:5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
1 Chronicles 14:6 Nogah, Nepheg, and Japhia,
1 Chronicles 14:7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
1 Chronicles 14:8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all of Israel, they all marched up to find him. When David heard of this, he went out to meet them.
1 Chronicles 14:9 The Philistines came and spread out across the Valley of Rephaim.
1 Chronicles 14:10 David asked the Lord, saying, "Should I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?" The Lord said to him, "Go up, and I will deliver them into your hand."
1 Chronicles 14:11 So David went up to Baal-perazim and defeated them there. David said, "God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood of water." Therefore, that place was named Baal-perazim, meaning 'Lord of Breakthroughs'.
1 Chronicles 14:12 The Philistines left their idols there, and David had them burned with fire.
1 Chronicles 14:13 However, the Philistines regrouped and spread out once more in the Valley of Rephaim.
1 Chronicles 14:14 David again consulted the Lord. The Lord said to him, "Do not go up directly after them. Instead, circle around them and attack them from opposite the pear trees.
1 Chronicles 14:15 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the pear trees, then go out to battle. For God will go out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines."
1 Chronicles 14:16 So David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon all the way to Gezer.
1 Chronicles 14:17 Thus, David's fame spread throughout all the regions, and the Lord caused dread of him to fall upon all nations.
1 Chronicles 15:1 King David also built his royal residences in the city of David. He also prepared a specific place for the Ark of God, and set up a tent to house it there.
1 Chronicles 15:2 Then David declared: 'Only the tribe of Levi is permitted to carry the Ark of God, for the Lord chose them specifically to carry it and to serve Him as priests for all time.'
1 Chronicles 15:3 King David assembled all the people of Israel in Jerusalem so that the Ark of God could be brought to the dedicated place he had prepared for it.
1 Chronicles 15:4 David also specifically gathered the priests and the Levites.
1 Chronicles 15:5 From the descendants of Kohath, Uriel was the chief, along with 120 of his kinsmen.
1 Chronicles 15:6 From the descendants of Merari, Asaiah was the chief, along with 220 of his kinsmen.
1 Chronicles 15:7 From the descendants of Gershom, Joel was the chief, along with 130 of his kinsmen.
1 Chronicles 15:8 From the descendants of Elizaphan, Shemaiah was the chief, along with 200 of his kinsmen.
1 Chronicles 15:9 From the descendants of Hebron, Eliel was the chief, along with 80 of his kinsmen.
1 Chronicles 15:10 From the descendants of Uzziel, Amminadab was the chief, along with 112 of his kinsmen.
1 Chronicles 15:11 David then summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, along with the Levite chiefs Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
1 Chronicles 15:12 He said to them: 'As the chiefs of the Levitical families, you must consecrate yourselves, along with your kinsmen. Then you are to bring the Ark of the Lord God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it.'
1 Chronicles 15:13 'Our Lord God struck us down the first time we attempted to move the Ark, because you, the Levites, were not there to carry it as commanded from the beginning. It was not done according to the law.'
1 Chronicles 15:14 So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves, preparing to bring the Ark of the Lord God of Israel.
1 Chronicles 15:15 And the sons of Levi carried the Ark of God, as Moses had specifically commanded according to the Lord's word, on their shoulders, using the carrying poles.
1 Chronicles 15:16 Then David instructed the chiefs of the Levites to appoint singers from among their kinsmen to play musical instruments, specifically harps, lyres, and cymbals. This was so that the sound of rejoicing might echo loudly during the procession.
1 Chronicles 15:17 So they appointed the Levite Heman, son of Joel; and from among his kinsmen, Asaph, son of Berechiah; and from the descendants of Merari, Ethan, son of Kushaiah.
1 Chronicles 15:18 And with them were their kinsmen of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, who served as gatekeepers and aids in the procession.
1 Chronicles 15:19 The main singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan played loudly, clashing bronze cymbals.
1 Chronicles 15:20 Meanwhile, Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played on harps, specifically those tuned to 'Alamoth' – a high-pitched setting.
1 Chronicles 15:21 And Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah led on lyres, playing 'for the octave' – likely referring to a lower pitch or bass accompaniment.
1 Chronicles 15:22 Furthermore, Chenaniah, the chief of the Levites, was appointed to lead the chanting of the hymns, specifically the 'prophetic' or inspired songs, as he was highly skilled in this musical direction.
1 Chronicles 15:23 Berechiah and Elkanah were appointed to serve as doorkeepers for the Ark's tent.
1 Chronicles 15:24 Meanwhile, the priests Shebaniah, Jehoshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer blew trumpets loudly before the Ark of God. Additionally, Obed-Edom and Jehiah served as doorkeepers for the Ark's tent.
1 Chronicles 15:25 So King David, all the elders of Israel, and the military commanders went together to bring up the Ark of the Lord's Covenant from Obed-Edom's house with great joy.
1 Chronicles 15:26 Because God had granted success to the Levites who carried the Ark of the Lord's Covenant, seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed in thanksgiving and expiation.
1 Chronicles 15:27 King David was clothed in a robe made of fine linen. All the Levites who carried the Ark, as well as the singers, and Chenaniah, the chief of the chanting, were similarly clothed. David himself also wore a special linen ephod, indicating his priestly role in this religious ceremony.
1 Chronicles 15:28 And all of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord's Covenant with shouts of joy, to the sound of horns, trumpets, cymbals, harps, and lyres.
1 Chronicles 15:29 As the Ark of the Lord's Covenant reached the city of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul, looked out through a window. She saw King David dancing and celebrating with intense devotion and joy, and in her heart, she deeply despised him for it, considering it undignified for a king.
1 Chronicles 15:30 Then they brought in the Ark of God and placed it in the center of the tent that David had pitched for it. In that place, they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to God.
1 Chronicles 15:31 When David finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people of Israel in the name of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 15:32 And David distributed food to everyone in the crowd, both men and women. Each person received a loaf of bread, a portion of roasted beef, and a rich, sweet cake made with oil. After this, all the people returned to their homes.
1 Chronicles 15:33 Then David appointed specific Levites to minister continually before the Ark of the Lord, serving both day and night.
1 Chronicles 15:34 Asaph was appointed as the chief minister, and Zechariah as his second. Additionally, Jehiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obed-Edom served, with Jeiel being specifically in charge of the musical instruments like the psalteries and lyres.
1 Chronicles 15:35 However, Asaph himself led with trumpets and cymbals, creating a powerful and harmonious sound.
1 Chronicles 15:36 Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight kinsmen were assigned roles, including Obed-Edom, son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, who served as gatekeepers.
1 Chronicles 15:37 Meanwhile, Zadok the priest, and his kinsmen the other priests, served before the Lord's tabernacle that remained on the high place at Gibeon.
1 Chronicles 15:38 Their duty was to continually offer burnt offerings both morning and evening, in accordance with everything written in the Law of the Lord, which He had commanded to Israel.
1 Chronicles 15:39 And with these priests at Gibeon were Heman and Jeduthun, along with the other chosen Levites who had been specifically appointed. Their role was to give thanks to the Lord, especially for His enduring mercy, which is eternal.
1 Chronicles 15:40 In this service, Heman and Jeduthun played trumpets, cymbals, and all kinds of other musical instruments, glorifying God.
1 Chronicles 16:1 Then they brought in the ark of God and placed it inside the tent that David had set up for it.
Then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
1 Chronicles 16:2 After David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings,
he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 16:3 And he distributed to everyone, from man to woman,
a loaf of bread, a portion of roasted beef, and flour cakes fried with oil.
1 Chronicles 16:4 Then David appointed Levites before the ark of the Lord to minister there,
to commemorate the works of the Lord, to give thanks, and to praise the Lord God of Israel.
1 Chronicles 16:5 Asaph was appointed as the chief, with Zechariah as his second.
Jeiel, Semiramoth, Jeiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel were put in charge of the psalteries and lyres.
Asaph himself was to sound the cymbals.
1 Chronicles 16:6 And Benaiah and Jahaziel, the priests,
were to blow the trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 16:7 On that day, David commanded that thanks be given to the Lord
through Asaph and his brethren.
1 Chronicles 16:8 Give thanks to the Lord, and call upon His name.
Make His deeds known among the peoples.
1 Chronicles 16:9 Sing to Him, and sing praises to Him.
Recount all His wondrous works.
1 Chronicles 16:10 Glory in His holy name.
Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
1 Chronicles 16:11 Seek the Lord and His strength.
Seek His presence continually.
1 Chronicles 16:12 Remember His wondrous works that He has done,
remember His signs, and the judgments from His mouth.
1 Chronicles 16:13 O seed of Israel, His servants;
you sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
1 Chronicles 16:14 He is the Lord our God.
His judgments are throughout the entire earth.
1 Chronicles 16:15 Remember His covenant forever,
the word He commanded for a thousand generations.
1 Chronicles 16:16 The covenant He established with Abraham,
and His oath to Isaac.
1 Chronicles 16:17 And He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
and to Israel as an everlasting covenant.
1 Chronicles 16:18 Saying: 'To you I will give the land of Canaan,
the measured portion of your inheritance.'
1 Chronicles 16:19 When they were few in number, a small company,
and only sojourners in that land.
1 Chronicles 16:20 And they wandered from nation to nation,
and from one kingdom to another people.
1 Chronicles 16:21 He allowed no one to oppress them,
and for their sake, He rebuked kings.
1 Chronicles 16:22 'Do not touch My anointed ones,
and do no harm to My prophets.'
1 Chronicles 16:23 Sing to the Lord, all the earth.
Proclaim His salvation day after day.
1 Chronicles 16:24 Declare His glory among the nations.
Recount His wondrous works among all peoples.
1 Chronicles 16:25 For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised.
He is to be feared above all false gods.
1 Chronicles 16:26 For all the gods of the nations are idols;
but the Lord Himself made the universe.
1 Chronicles 16:27 Confession and majesty are before Him.
Strength and joy are in His dwelling place.
1 Chronicles 16:28 Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the nations,
ascribe to the Lord glory and power.
1 Chronicles 16:29 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name.
Bring offerings and come before Him.
Worship the Lord in His holy splendor.
1 Chronicles 16:30 Let all the earth tremble before Him.
For He has established the world, so it cannot be moved from its purpose.
1 Chronicles 16:31 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth exult.
And let it be said among the nations: 'The Lord reigns!'
1 Chronicles 16:32 Let the sea roar, and all that fills it.
Let the fields be joyful, and all things that are in them.
1 Chronicles 16:33 Then all the trees of the forest will rejoice before the Lord.
For He comes to judge the earth.
1 Chronicles 16:34 Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good.
For His mercy endures forever.
1 Chronicles 16:35 And say: 'Save us, O God, our Savior!
Gather us and deliver us from the nations.
So that we may give thanks to Your holy name and exult in Your praise.'
1 Chronicles 16:36 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity.
And let all the people say, 'Amen,' and 'Praise the Lord!'
1 Chronicles 16:37 So David left Asaph and his brethren there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
to minister continually before it, day by day.
1 Chronicles 16:38 And Obed-Edom with his sixty-eight brethren,
and Obed-Edom the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, were appointed as gatekeepers.
1 Chronicles 16:39 But Zadok the priest, and his brethren, the priests,
were before the tabernacle of the Lord on the high place that was in Gibeon.
1 Chronicles 16:40 So that they might offer burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of burnt offering continually, morning and evening,
according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which He commanded Israel.
1 Chronicles 17:1 It came to pass that when David had settled into his own palace, he spoke to Nathan the prophet: 'Look, I am living in a house built with cedar wood, but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord is still housed in tents.'
1 Chronicles 17:2 And Nathan said to David: 'Do everything that is in your heart, for the Lord God is with you in this.'
1 Chronicles 17:3 Then, in that very night, a word from the Lord God came to Nathan, saying:
1 Chronicles 17:4 'Go and speak to David, my servant, and tell him: 'This is what the Lord God says: You are not the one who will build a house for me to dwell in.'
1 Chronicles 17:5 For I have not lived in a house from the day I led Israel out of Egypt until this very day. Instead, I have always been moving around in a tent, even in another temporary dwelling.
1 Chronicles 17:6 Wherever I traveled with all of Israel, did I ever speak a word to any of the judges of Israel—those I commanded to shepherd My people—and say, 'Why have you not built me a house of cedar?'
1 Chronicles 17:7 Now therefore, you shall say this to my servant David: 'This is what the Lord of hosts says: I took you from the pastures, from following the flocks, to be ruler over my people Israel.
1 Chronicles 17:8 I have been with you wherever you went, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. I have made for you a great name, like the names of the most powerful people on the earth.
1 Chronicles 17:9 Moreover, I have appointed a place for My people Israel, and I have planted them there. They will dwell in their own place and no longer be disturbed. Nor shall wicked people oppress them as they did at the beginning,
1 Chronicles 17:10 ...and as they did from the days when I appointed judges over My people Israel. I will humble all your enemies. Furthermore, I declare to you that the Lord God Himself will build you a house —a lasting dynasty.
1 Chronicles 17:11 And when your days are fulfilled, and you go to be with your fathers in death, I will raise up your offspring after you, who will be one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom firmly.
1 Chronicles 17:12 He it is who will build a house for My name—My Temple—and I will establish his throne forever.
1 Chronicles 17:13 I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to Me. I will not take away My mercy from him, as I took it away from the one who was before you.
1 Chronicles 17:14 But I will establish him in My house—My dynasty and My Temple—and in My kingdom forever, and his throne will be most firm and enduring perpetually.
1 Chronicles 17:15 According to all these words and according to this entire vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
1 Chronicles 17:16 Then King David went in and sat before the Lord God, and he said: 'Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house—my family and dynasty—that you have brought me to such great honor?
1 Chronicles 17:17 Yet even this seemed a small thing in Your eyes, O God, for You have spoken concerning the house of Your servant far into the future. You have looked upon me as a man of high standing and have exalted me greatly.
1 Chronicles 17:18 What more can David say to You, after You have so honored Your servant, and after You have intimately known him and his heart?
1 Chronicles 17:19 O Lord, for Your servant's sake, and according to Your own heart's purpose, You have done all these great deeds and have revealed all these things.
1 Chronicles 17:20 O Lord, there is no one like You, and there is no God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our own ears.
1 Chronicles 17:21 And what other nation on earth is like Your people Israel, whom You went forth to redeem for Yourself, to make for Yourself a great and awe-inspiring name, and to cast out nations from before them?
1 Chronicles 17:22 And You have established Your people Israel as Your own people forever, and You, O Lord God, have become their God.
1 Chronicles 17:23 Now therefore, O Lord, let the word that You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as You have promised.
1 Chronicles 17:24 Let it also remain, and let Your name be magnified forever, so that people will say, 'The Lord of hosts is truly the God of Israel!' And let the house of David Your servant remain established before You.
1 Chronicles 17:25 For You, O Lord my God, have revealed to Your servant's hearing that You intend to build him a lasting dynasty. Therefore, Your servant has found the confidence to pray before You.
1 Chronicles 17:26 Now, O Lord, You are God, and You have spoken such great and gracious promises to Your servant.
1 Chronicles 17:27 And now, please begin to confirm Your blessing upon the house of Your servant forever, for You, O Lord, have indeed blessed it, and therefore it shall be blessed perpetually.
1 Chronicles 18:1 After these events, David struck down the Philistines and subdued them. He took Gath, along with its dependent towns, from the Philistines.
1 Chronicles 18:2 And he struck down Moab, and the Moabites became David's servants, offering him tribute.
1 Chronicles 18:3 Also at this time, David struck down Hadadezer, king of Zobah (a region near Hamath), when Hadadezer was marching to extend his dominion as far as the Euphrates River.
1 Chronicles 18:4 So David captured from Hadadezer one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He then disabled all the horses of the chariots by cutting their hamstrings, except for the horses of one hundred chariots, which he kept for himself.
1 Chronicles 18:5 When the Syrians from Damascus came to assist Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of these Syrian soldiers.
1 Chronicles 18:6 David then stationed garrisons in Damascus in Syria, and the Syrians became David's servants and brought him tribute. And the Lord helped David in everything he did.
1 Chronicles 18:7 David also took the golden shields that Hadadezer's officers had carried and brought them to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 18:8 From Tibhath and Cun, cities belonging to Hadadezer, David took a large quantity of bronze, from which Solomon later made the bronze sea (a large basin for the Temple), pillars, and bronze bases.
1 Chronicles 18:9 When Tou, king of Hamath, heard that David had struck down the entire army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah,
1 Chronicles 18:10 he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him because David had fought Hadadezer and struck him down (for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou). Hadoram also brought all sorts of vessels made of gold, silver, and bronze.
1 Chronicles 18:11 King David immediately consecrated these to the Lord, along with the silver and gold he had taken from all the nations he had conquered: from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.
1 Chronicles 18:12 Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, also struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
1 Chronicles 18:13 He then placed garrisons in Edom, so that Edom would be subject to David. And the Lord brought victory to David in everything he undertook.
1 Chronicles 18:14 So David reigned over all of Israel, administering justice and righteousness to all his people.
1 Chronicles 18:15 Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was commander of the army, and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the royal recorder (keeper of official records).
1 Chronicles 18:16 Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, were priests. Shavsha (also called Shisha or Seraiah) was the secretary.
1 Chronicles 18:17 Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites (David's elite guard). And David's sons were the king's chief officials.
1 Chronicles 19:1 Now, after these events, Nahash, who was the king of the Ammonites, died, and his son succeeded him as king.
1 Chronicles 19:2 Then King David said: 'I will show kindness to Hanun, the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.' So David sent messengers to comfort Hanun over the death of his father. When these messengers arrived in the land of the Ammonites to comfort Hanun,
1 Chronicles 19:3 the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun: 'Do you truly believe that David has sent these men to comfort you out of respect for your father's memory? Is it not rather that he sent them to spy out your entire land, to explore it, and then to overthrow it?'
1 Chronicles 19:4 So Hanun took David's servants, publicly humiliated them by shaving off half of each man’s beard, and cutting their garments in half up to their buttocks. Then he sent them away.
1 Chronicles 19:5 When these men returned and reported everything that had happened to David, he sent people to meet them—for they were deeply disgraced and ashamed. David commanded them: 'Remain in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then you may return.'
1 Chronicles 19:6 When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves offensive to David, Hanun and his officials sent sixty thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-Maacah, and from Zobah.
1 Chronicles 19:7 So they hired thirty-two thousand chariots and their warriors, along with the king of Maacah and his people. When these allies arrived, they encamped facing Medeba. Meanwhile, the Ammonites gathered their own forces from their cities and came out to battle.
1 Chronicles 19:8 When David heard about this, he immediately sent Joab and his entire army of mighty warriors.
1 Chronicles 19:9 The Ammonites marched out and drew up their battle line by the city gate. The allied kings who had come to assist them took a separate position in the open field.
1 Chronicles 19:10 Joab, seeing that the battle was arrayed against him both in front and behind, selected the strongest men from all of Israel and positioned them against the Arameans, or Syrians, as they were also known.
1 Chronicles 19:11 He placed the rest of the Israelite people under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them against the Ammonites.
1 Chronicles 19:12 Joab said to Abishai: 'If the Arameans prove too strong for me, then you must come to my aid. But if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.'
1 Chronicles 19:13 'Be strong! Let us fight courageously for our people and for the cities of our God. May the Lord do what is good in His sight.'
1 Chronicles 19:14 So Joab and the people who were with him advanced to fight against the Arameans, who immediately fled before them.
1 Chronicles 19:15 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they themselves also fled from Abishai, Joab's brother, and retreated into their city. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 19:16 When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated before Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River. Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army, was leading them.
1 Chronicles 19:17 When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and advanced against them. He drew up his battle line against them. When David entered the battle against the Arameans, they fought against him.
1 Chronicles 19:18 The Arameans fled before Israel. David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers, and he also killed Shobach, their army commander.
1 Chronicles 19:19 When Hadadezer's servants saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made a treaty with David and submitted to him. After this, the Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.
1 Chronicles 20:1 Now, it happened after a year had passed, at the time when kings usually go out to wage war, Joab led out the army and devastated the land of the sons of Ammon. Then he came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem, while Joab attacked Rabbah and utterly destroyed it.
1 Chronicles 20:2 So David took the crown of Milcom from the Ammonite king's head. He found in it a weight of a single talent of gold, along with very precious stones. David then made a diadem for himself from it, and he carried away much spoil from the city.
1 Chronicles 20:3 He also brought out the people who were in the city, and he put them to forced labor with threshing sledges, iron wagons, and iron saws, and with various smaller iron tools used for cutting down trees. Thus David did to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David returned with all the army to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 20:4 After these things, a war happened in Gezer against the Philistines. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were humbled in defeat.
1 Chronicles 20:5 There was also another war against the Philistines, in which Eldadan, the son of the Forest, struck down Goliath's brother, the Gittite. The shaft of Goliath's brother's spear was like a weaver's beam.
1 Chronicles 20:6 There was also another war in Gath, in which there was a man of great stature. He had six fingers on each hand, making twenty-four fingers in total. And this man also was a descendant of the Rephaim.
1 Chronicles 20:7 This man blasphemed Israel. But Jonathan, the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down.
1 Chronicles 20:8 These were among the descendants of the Rephaim in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and his servants.
1 Chronicles 21:1 But Satan, the spiritual enemy of God and His people, rose up against Israel, and he provoked King David to count the people of Israel.
1 Chronicles 21:2 And King David said to Joab, the commander of his army, and to the other leaders of the people: 'Go, count all the men of Israel, from Beer-sheba in the south to Dan in the north, and bring the count back to me, so that I may know the total number.'
1 Chronicles 21:3 But Joab answered: 'May the Lord increase His people a hundred times over what they are now! My lord the king, are they not all your servants? Why does my lord seek to do this, which will be counted as a sin against Israel?'
1 Chronicles 21:4 However, the king's command prevailed and was more powerful than Joab's objection. So Joab went out and travelled throughout Israel, taking a census, and then returned to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 21:5 Therefore, Joab gave to David the total number of the men he had counted. The total number found in all of Israel was one million one hundred thousand men who could draw the sword; and in the tribe of Judah alone there were four hundred seventy thousand fighting men.
1 Chronicles 21:6 But Joab did not count the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because Joab considered the king's order to be an abomination and an error.
1 Chronicles 21:7 And this matter, this counting of the people by David, was displeasing to God, and because of it, God struck down the people of Israel with a plague.
1 Chronicles 21:8 And David said to God: 'I have sinned grievously by doing this. I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant, because I have acted very foolishly.'
1 Chronicles 21:9 And the Lord spoke to Gad, who was David's prophet and seer, saying:
1 Chronicles 21:10 'Go and speak to David, saying: "Thus says the Lord: 'I offer you three choices. Choose one of them that you desire, and I will do it to you.'"'
1 Chronicles 21:11 When Gad came to King David, he said to him: 'Thus says the Lord: "Choose what you desire from these options:"'
1 Chronicles 21:12 'Either three years of famine; or for three months you flee from your enemies, and the sword of your adversaries cannot be escaped; or for three days, the sword of the Lord, and a plague to spread throughout the land, and the angel of the Lord to kill throughout all the borders of Israel. Therefore, now consider what answer you will give to Him who sent me.'
1 Chronicles 21:13 And David said to Gad: 'I am in very great distress and confined by these choices. But it is better that I fall into the hands of the Lord, because His mercies are many, rather than fall into the hands of men.'
1 Chronicles 21:14 Therefore, the Lord sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel died.
1 Chronicles 21:15 And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to strike it. And as it was being struck, the Lord saw, and He had compassion on the multitude of people, and He commanded the angel who was striking them: 'It is enough now; stop your hand.' Indeed, the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles 21:16 And David, lifting his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between the earth and the sky, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. And both David himself and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces to the ground.
1 Chronicles 21:17 And David said to God: 'Was it not I who commanded the people to be counted? I am the one who sinned; I am the one who did wrong! These flocks, what have they committed? O Lord, my God, I beg you, let your hand be turned against me and against the house of my father, but let there be no plague upon Your people.'
1 Chronicles 21:18 Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell King David that David should go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles 21:19 So King David went up according to the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 21:20 Now Ornan, when he turned and looked around, saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves in fear. Ornan himself was threshing wheat at the time.
1 Chronicles 21:21 And when King David came to Ornan, Ornan looked up and, leaping from the threshing floor, he bowed down to David, prostrate on the ground.
1 Chronicles 21:22 And David said to Ornan: 'Give me the place of your threshing floor, so that I may build an altar to the Lord there. You must sell it to me at its just price, so that the plague may cease from the people.'
1 Chronicles 21:23 And Ornan said to David: 'Take it, and let my lord the king do what pleases him. See, I also give the oxen for a burnt offering, and the threshing sledges for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I offer everything willingly.'
1 Chronicles 21:24 But King David said to Ornan: 'No, not at all; I will surely buy it from you for a price. For I ought not to offer a burnt offering to the Lord my God that costs me nothing. Therefore, I will buy it from you for a price, and I will complete the sacrifice.'
1 Chronicles 21:25 So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of pure gold by weight.
1 Chronicles 21:26 And David built an altar to the Lord there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called upon the Lord, and the Lord answered him by sending fire from the sky upon the altar of burnt offering.
1 Chronicles 21:27 Then the Lord commanded the angel, and the angel put his sword back into its sheath.
1 Chronicles 21:28 Therefore, when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.
1 Chronicles 21:29 Now the Tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time on the high place at Gibeon.
1 Chronicles 21:30 But David was not able to go there to worship God, because he was terrified by extreme fear, terrified by the sight of the sword of the angel of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 22:1 Then David designated the location for the Temple of the Lord, and for the altar where burnt offerings would be made.
1 Chronicles 22:2 He then ordered all the foreigners living in the land of Israel to be gathered together. From among them, he appointed stonecutters to cut and square stones for the building of God's Temple.
1 Chronicles 22:3 David also prepared a great quantity of iron for the nails, for joining the timbers, and for all the construction work; and an immense amount of bronze, so much that it could not even be weighed.
1 Chronicles 22:4 He also prepared a countless number of cedar logs, because the people of Sidon and Tyre had brought many cedar timbers to David.
1 Chronicles 22:5 And David said: "My son Solomon is still young and inexperienced, and the Temple that is to be built for the Lord must be so magnificent that it will be famous throughout all the lands. Therefore, I will prepare everything he needs for it." So, for this reason, David prepared everything before his death.
1 Chronicles 22:6 Then he called his son Solomon and commanded him to build a house for the Lord, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles 22:7 And David said to Solomon: "My son, it was my heartfelt desire to build a house for the Name of the Lord, my God."
1 Chronicles 22:8 "But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 'You have shed much blood and fought many wars; therefore, you cannot build a house for My Name, because of the great amount of blood you have shed on the earth before Me.'"
1 Chronicles 22:9 "'For a son will indeed be born to you who will be a man of rest, and I will give him peace from all his enemies on every side. His name will be called Solomon, which means peace, and I will grant peace and tranquility to Israel all his days.'"
1 Chronicles 22:10 "'He is the one who will build a house for My Name, and he will be My son, and I will be his Father. And I will establish his throne over Israel forever.'"
1 Chronicles 22:11 "Now therefore, my son, may the Lord be with you, and may you prosper as you build the house for the Lord your God, just as He spoke concerning you."
1 Chronicles 22:12 "May the Lord also grant you wisdom and understanding, so that you may be able to govern Israel and keep the law of the Lord your God."
1 Chronicles 22:13 "For then you will be able to direct your ways successfully if you observe the commands and judgments which the Lord commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and act courageously; do not be afraid, and do not be dismayed by anything."
1 Chronicles 22:14 "Indeed, in my humble efforts, I have prepared for the expenses of the Lord's house: one hundred thousand talents of gold, and one million talents of silver. As for bronze and iron, there is no weight that can be measured, for there was so much that it exceeded all counting."
1 Chronicles 22:15 "Moreover, you have a great number of skilled workers: masons, and stonecutters, carpenters, and craftsmen for every kind of art and skill."
1 Chronicles 22:16 "There is no end to the gold, silver, bronze, and iron. So rise up and begin the work, and the Lord will be with you."
1 Chronicles 22:17 David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to assist his son Solomon, saying:
1 Chronicles 22:18 "Behold, the Lord your God is with you. He has granted you rest on every side, and He has handed all your enemies into your hands, so the land is subdued before the Lord and before His people."
1 Chronicles 22:19 "Therefore, dedicate your hearts and your souls to seek the Lord your God. Rise up and build the sanctuary for the Lord God, so that the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God's sanctuary may be brought into the house that is being built for the Name of the Lord."
1 Chronicles 23:1 Therefore, when David was old and had lived many years, he appointed his son Solomon to be king over Israel.
1 Chronicles 23:2 He gathered all the princes of Israel, as well as the priests and the Levites.
1 Chronicles 23:3 Therefore, the Levites were counted—those who were thirty years of age and older—and a total of thirty-eight thousand men were found.
1 Chronicles 23:4 From these men, twenty-four thousand were assigned to oversee the work of the Lord's Temple and to serve in its duties.
1 Chronicles 23:5 Furthermore, six thousand were appointed as scribes and judges.
1 Chronicles 23:6 And four thousand were gatekeepers, and another four thousand were singers, chanting praises to the Lord with the musical instruments that David had made for singing.
1 Chronicles 23:7 These are the sons of Levi according to their family lines: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1 Chronicles 23:8 The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles 23:9 The sons of Ladan were Jechiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel—three in total.
1 Chronicles 23:10 The sons of Shimei were Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah—these were the four sons of Shimei.
1 Chronicles 23:11 Now Jahath was the firstborn, and Ziza was the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, and for that reason, they were counted as one family and one household.
1 Chronicles 23:12 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four in total.
1 Chronicles 23:13 The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart, he and his sons forever, to minister in the Holy of Holies, to burn incense before the Lord, to serve Him, and to bless His name perpetually.
1 Chronicles 23:14 Moreover, the sons of Moses, the man of God, were also counted among the tribe of Levi.
1 Chronicles 23:15 The sons of Moses were Gershon and Eliezer.
1 Chronicles 23:16 The son of Gershon was Shebuel, the firstborn.
1 Chronicles 23:17 The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah, the firstborn. Eliezer had no other sons besides him. But the sons of Rehabiah multiplied greatly.
1 Chronicles 23:18 The sons of Izhar were Shelomith, the firstborn.
1 Chronicles 23:19 The sons of Hebron were Jeriah, the firstborn; Amariah, the second; Jahaziel, the third; and Jekameam, the fourth.
1 Chronicles 23:20 The sons of Uzziel were Micah, the firstborn; and Jesiah, the second.
1 Chronicles 23:21 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish.
1 Chronicles 23:22 Now Eleazar died, and he had no sons, only daughters. Therefore, the sons of Kish, their cousins, married them.
1 Chronicles 23:23 The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth—three in total.
1 Chronicles 23:24 These are the sons of Levi in their clans and families, the heads of the families according to their divisions, and the count of the names of each individual, who performed the work of the service of the Lord's house, starting from twenty years of age and older.
1 Chronicles 23:25 For David had declared: “The Lord God of Israel has given rest to His people, and His dwelling place is in Jerusalem forever.”
1 Chronicles 23:26 Therefore, it would no longer be necessary for the Levites to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels—which were the instruments of their service.
1 Chronicles 23:27 For according to David’s most recent count, the sons of Levi were those aged twenty years and older.
1 Chronicles 23:28 And they are to stand under the authority of the sons of Aaron for the service of the Lord’s house, in the courtyards, and in the chambers, and in the upper rooms, and in the inner sanctuaries, and at the mercy seat, and with all the vessels for the service of the Lord’s Temple.
1 Chronicles 23:29 They are also responsible for the showbread, and the fine flour for the sacrifice, and the unleavened cakes, and that which is baked in the pan, and that which is fried, and for every weight and measure.
1 Chronicles 23:30 And they are to stand every morning to praise and give thanks to the Lord, and likewise in the evening.
1 Chronicles 23:31 They are to assist with the offering of the Lord’s burnt offerings, as well as on the Sabbaths, and at the new moons, and at all other solemn feast days, according to the prescribed number and ceremonies for each, always before the Lord.
1 Chronicles 23:32 And they are to guard the watch of the tabernacle of testimony, and the watch of the sanctuary, and the watch of their brethren, the sons of Aaron, so that they may serve in the houses of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 23:33 These are the sons of Kohath by their families: the chiefs of the families of Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.
1 Chronicles 23:34 The sons of Merari by their families were the chiefs of the families of Mahli and Mushi. And these are the sons of Levi by their families.
1 Chronicles 23:35 And Eleazar was the chief priest, and Kish was also a chief.
1 Chronicles 23:36 Eleazar was the high priest, and his sons held the priesthood after him. And his son became high priest in his place. And these were the sons of Kohath by their families.
1 Chronicles 23:37 The sons of Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.
1 Chronicles 23:38 The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles 23:39 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.
1 Chronicles 23:40 All the Levites, by their families and by their fathers' households, according to their divisions and their total number, from thirty years of age and older, up to fifty years of age, were serving in the houses of the Lord, performing all the labor of the ministers' work, and the service of the tabernacle of testimony.
1 Chronicles 24:1 Now, these were the assigned divisions for the sons of Aaron. The original sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
1 Chronicles 24:2 However, Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and they had no children. So, Eleazar and Ithamar were the ones who carried out the duties of the priesthood.
1 Chronicles 24:3 King David, along with Zadok from the lineage of Eleazar, and Ahimelech from the lineage of Ithamar, then organized these priestly families. He established their specific courses of service and their particular duties within the ministry.
1 Chronicles 24:4 It was discovered that the descendants of Eleazar had many more leading men than the descendants of Ithamar. Therefore, King David assigned sixteen family heads from the sons of Eleazar and eight family heads from the sons of Ithamar, according to their respective family lines.
1 Chronicles 24:5 David then organized their courses of service by lot, treating both groups equally. However, more leading men and mighty warriors were found among the descendants of Eleazar, so their courses were more numerous.
1 Chronicles 24:6 Shemaiah, son of Nethaneel, a Levite scribe, recorded them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the priestly and Levite families. He recorded one leading family line from Eleazar, and another leading family line from Ithamar.
1 Chronicles 24:7 The first lot drawn was for Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah.
1 Chronicles 24:8 The third was for Harim, the fourth for Seorim.
1 Chronicles 24:9 The fifth was for Malchijah, the sixth for Mijamin.
1 Chronicles 24:10 The seventh was for Hakkoz, the eighth for Abijah.

1 Chronicles 24:13 The thirteenth was for Huppah, the fourteenth for Jeshebeab.
1 Chronicles 24:14 The fifteenth was for Bilgah, the sixteenth for Immer.
1 Chronicles 24:15 The seventeenth was for Hezir, the eighteenth for Happizzez.
1 Chronicles 24:16 The nineteenth was for Pethahiah, the twentieth for Jehezkel.
1 Chronicles 24:17 The twenty-first was for Jachin, the twenty-second for Gamul.
1 Chronicles 24:18 The twenty-third was for Delaiah, the twenty-fourth for Maaziah.
1 Chronicles 24:19 These were their ordered courses of service when they went into the House of the Lord. They followed the directions of Aaron their father, just as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him.
1 Chronicles 24:20 Now, concerning the remaining descendants of Levi: from the sons of Amram, there was Shubael. From the sons of Shubael, there was Jehdeiah.
1 Chronicles 24:21 From the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah was the chief.
1 Chronicles 24:22 From the Izharites, there was Shelomith. From the sons of Shelomith, there was Jahath.
1 Chronicles 24:23 His son was Amram, and Izhar, and Jehath, and Beriah. And the sons of Uzziel were Micah, and the sons of Micah were Shamir.
1 Chronicles 24:24 Micah's brother was Isshiah. And the sons of Isshiah were Zechariah.
1 Chronicles 24:25 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Jaaziah were Beno.
1 Chronicles 24:26 The other sons of Merari were Jaaziah, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
1 Chronicles 24:27 The sons of Mahli were Eleazar, who had no sons.
1 Chronicles 24:28 And the sons of Kish were Jerahmeel.
1 Chronicles 24:29 The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of Levi according to their family lines.
1 Chronicles 24:30 King David, along with Zadok, Ahimelech the chief priest, and the heads of the Levite families, appointed these individuals for their courses of service. They were designated to minister in the House of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 24:31 They also cast lots for their courses of service, just as their brothers, the sons of Aaron, had done. This was done in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the priestly and Levite families. Both relatives and non-relatives were assigned their duties by lot, ensuring an equal and impartial distribution of roles.
1 Chronicles 25:1 So David and the commanders of the army set apart the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun for a sacred service. These were to proclaim God's message using harps, lyres, and cymbals, according to the total number appointed.
1 Chronicles 25:2 From the sons of Asaph were Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. These were under the direction of Asaph, who was proclaiming God's message according to the king's command.
1 Chronicles 25:3 For Jeduthun, there were six sons: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, Mattithiah, and Shemei. They were all under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who proclaimed God's message with the harp, in giving thanks and praises to the Lord.
1 Chronicles 25:4 From Heman were Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
1 Chronicles 25:5 All these were the sons of Heman, who, as royal officials for God's message, were to lift up the horn of triumph in their service. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
1 Chronicles 25:6 All these musicians were under the direction of their fathers for singing in the Temple of the Lord, using cymbals, lyres, and harps. This was all for the sacred service of the Lord's house, according to the king's command, set by Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.
1 Chronicles 25:7 The total number of these musicians, along with their kinsmen who were being trained and who sang to the Lord, all of them skilled and understanding in their craft, was two hundred and eighty-eight.
1 Chronicles 25:8 They also cast lots to determine their divisions of service, involving both the younger and the older members, and including both the skilled and those still in training.
1 Chronicles 25:9 The first lot fell to Joseph, of the lineage of Asaph. The second lot went to Gedaliah, who, along with his sons and kinsmen, numbered twelve in his division.

1 Chronicles 26:1 So then, these were the appointed divisions of the gatekeepers: From the Korahites was Meshelemiah, the son of Kore, one of the sons of Asaph.
1 Chronicles 26:2 Meshelemiah had sons: Zachariah, the firstborn; Jediael, the second; Zebadiah, the third; Jathanael, the fourth;
1 Chronicles 26:3 Elam, the fifth; Johanan, the sixth; and Elioenai, the seventh.

1 Chronicles 26:5 Ammiel, the sixth; Issachar, the seventh; and Peulthai, the eighth. All these were because the Lord had blessed him.
1 Chronicles 26:6 To his son Shemaiah, other sons were born who became heads of their families, because they were very strong men.
1 Chronicles 26:7 Therefore, the sons of Shemaiah were Othni, Raphaël, Obed, and Elzabad. His brothers, who were also very strong men, were Elihu and Semachiah.
1 Chronicles 26:8 All these men were from the sons of Obed-Edom—they, their sons, and their brothers—all very strong and capable for service. There were sixty-two descendants from Obed-Edom.
1 Chronicles 26:9 Moreover, Meshelemiah's sons and their brothers were also very strong men, eighteen in total.
1 Chronicles 26:10 From Hosah, who was from the sons of Merari, were these sons: Shimri, the chief, whom his father had appointed as chief because he had no firstborn son;
1 Chronicles 26:11 Hilkiah, the second; Tebaliah, the third; and Zechariah, the fourth. All these, including Hosah's sons and brothers, numbered thirteen.
1 Chronicles 26:12 These were the divisions of the gatekeepers: these leading men had their duties to minister to their brethren.
1 Chronicles 26:13 They cast lots, fairly and equally, among the small and the great among their families, for each gate.
1 Chronicles 26:14 So the eastern lot fell to Shelemiah. Then for his son Zechariah (who was a very prudent counselor), they also cast lots, and his lot fell to the north.
1 Chronicles 26:15 Obed-Edom received the southern lot; and for his sons, the house of Asaph.
1 Chronicles 26:16 Hosah received the western lot, by the assigned turn of the lot, for the road leading up the ascent, and for the Shallecheth Gate.
1 Chronicles 26:17 To the east, there were six Levites; to the north, four each day; to the south, likewise four each day; and at the storehouse where the treasures were kept, two by two.
1 Chronicles 26:18 Also at Parbar, to the west, there were four on the highway and two at Parbar itself.
1 Chronicles 26:19 These were the divisions of the gatekeepers from the sons of Korah and Merari.
1 Chronicles 26:20 Moreover, among the Levites, Ahijah was in charge of the treasures of the house of God and the consecrated treasures.

1 Chronicles 26:25 His brothers were Eliezer, whose son was Rehabiah; and his son was Jeshaiah; and his son was Joram; and his son was Zichri; and his son was Shelomith.
1 Chronicles 26:26 This Shelomith and his brothers were in charge of the consecrated treasures, which King David, the heads of families, the military commanders (tribunes and centurions), and the army leaders had consecrated.
1 Chronicles 26:27 These were things consecrated from battles and plunder.
1 Chronicles 26:28 And all things that Samuel the prophet had consecrated, and Saul, the son of Kish, and Abner, the son of Ner, and Joab, the son of Zeruiah: all these consecrated things were under the authority of Shelomith and his brothers.
1 Chronicles 26:29 From the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were appointed for external duties over Israel, to teach and to judge.
1 Chronicles 26:30 From the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, strong men numbering one thousand seven hundred, were in charge of Israel west of the Jordan, for all the work of the Lord and for the service of the king.
1 Chronicles 26:31 Moreover, from the Hebronites, Jeriah was the chief, according to their genealogies and families. In the fortieth year of David's reign, they were counted, and very strong men were found among them in Jazer of Gilead.
1 Chronicles 26:32 His brothers, also very strong men, numbered two thousand seven hundred, heads of families. King David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for everything pertaining to God and to the king.
1 Chronicles 27:1 Now, for the people of Israel, according to the official count of their people, the family leaders, the military commanders (of thousands and hundreds), and other officers who served the king in their assigned divisions, these groups were assigned to serve by taking turns, going in and out, for each month of the year, under individual leaders. Each of these service groups had twenty-four thousand men.

1 Chronicles 27:23 Now, King David did not want to include those twenty years old and under in his census, because the Lord had said that He would multiply Israel like the stars of the universe.
1 Chronicles 27:24 Joab, the son of Sarvia, had begun to take the census, but he did not complete it. Because of this, the Lord became angry with Israel, and for that reason, the total number was not included in the Book of the Paralipomenon (Chronicles) of King David.
1 Chronicles 27:25 Over the king's treasuries was Azmoth, the son of Adiel. And over the treasuries that were in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, Jonathas, the son of Ozias, presided.
1 Chronicles 27:26 Over the field workers and the farmers who tilled the land was Ezri, the son of Chelub.
1 Chronicles 27:27 Over the vineyards was Semeias the Romathite. Over the produce of the vineyards and the wine cellars was Zabdi the Siphmites.
1 Chronicles 27:28 Over the olive groves and fig trees, which were in the lowlands, was Balanan the Gederite. Over the stores of oil was Joas.
1 Chronicles 27:29 Over the herds of cattle that pastured in Saron was Sareth the Saronite. And over the livestock in the valleys was Saphat, the son of Addai.
1 Chronicles 27:30 Over the camels was Obil the Ismahelite. And over the donkeys was Jadai the Meronathite.
1 Chronicles 27:31 Over the flocks of sheep was Jaziz the Agarenus. All these were the chief officers over the property of King David.
1 Chronicles 27:32 Now, Jonathas, David's nephew, was a wise and learned counselor. He, along with Jahiel, the son of Hachamoni, were with the king's sons.
1 Chronicles 27:33 Achitophel was also a counselor to the king. And Chusai the Arachite was the king's trusted friend.
1 Chronicles 27:34 And after Achitophel's influence declined, Jojada, the son of Banaias, and Abiathar became counselors. Now, the chief commander of the king's army was Joab.
1 Chronicles 28:1 King David gathered all the leaders of Israel: the heads of the tribes, the officers of the military divisions who served the king, and the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. He also called the overseers of those who managed the king’s possessions, and all of his sons. With them were the royal court officials, the mighty men, and every brave warrior in Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 28:2 Then King David rose to his feet and said, "Listen to me, my brothers, and all my people. I had planned in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, which is the footstool of our God. And I had prepared everything necessary for this building."
1 Chronicles 28:3 But God said to me, "You shall not build a house for My Name, because you are a man of war and have shed much blood."
1 Chronicles 28:4 However, the Lord, the God of Israel, chose me from all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For He chose Judah to be the leading tribe, and from the house of Judah, He chose my father’s house. Then, from among the sons of my father, He chose me alone to make me king over all the people of Israel.
1 Chronicles 28:5 And from among my own sons (for the Lord has given me many sons), He chose Solomon, my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
1 Chronicles 28:6 And He said to me, "Solomon your son shall build My house and My courts, where My presence will dwell. For I have chosen him for Myself to be My son, and I will be a Father to him."
1 Chronicles 28:7 I will establish his kingdom forever, if he continues to keep My commandments and My judgments, just as he does today.
1 Chronicles 28:8 Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, which is the assembly of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the Lord our God. Do this so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your children after you, forever.
1 Chronicles 28:9 And you, Solomon, my son, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind. For the Lord searches all hearts and understands every thought and intention of the mind. If you seek Him, you will find Him. But if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.
1 Chronicles 28:10 See now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for His sanctuary. Therefore, be strong and do what He has called you to do.
1 Chronicles 28:11 Then David gave Solomon his son the complete architectural plan for the porch, and for the temple structure itself, including its treasuries, its upper rooms, its inner chambers, and the house of the mercy seat (the Holy of Holies).
1 Chronicles 28:12 He also gave him the plans for everything he had conceived and designed under divine inspiration from the Spirit of God. This included the plans for the courts, and for all the surrounding rooms where the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the holy things were kept.
1 Chronicles 28:13 Furthermore, David provided the plans for the divisions of the priests and the Levites. These plans detailed all the work of the service of the house of the Lord and specified all the vessels required for the service of the Temple.
1 Chronicles 28:14 He also specified the precise weight for the golden and silver clasps, and for all the vessels to be used for the construction work and the sacred ministry. Additionally, he stipulated the weight for each individual vessel, considering its specific use in the various ministries of the Temple.
1 Chronicles 28:15 David specified the weight for the golden lampstands and their golden lamps, precisely according to the various measurements of each lampstand and its corresponding lamps. Similarly, for the silver lampstands and their lamps, he laid out the weight and the precise measurements, detailing the diversity and specific use for each.
1 Chronicles 28:16 He specified the weight for the golden tables of the showbread and for the silver ones.
1 Chronicles 28:17 He gave the precise weight for each of the golden forks, bowls, and cups. Likewise, for the silver vessels, he carefully weighed and determined the different weights in pounds.
1 Chronicles 28:18 And for the altar of incense, he specified pure gold. He also provided plans for the golden cherubim, whose wings would be spread out and cover the ark of the covenant of the Lord, giving the appearance of a divine chariot-throne.
1 Chronicles 28:19 "All these things," David said, "the Lord made me understand in writing, giving me insight into all the specific works and designs for the Temple."
1 Chronicles 28:20 Then David said to Solomon his son, "Act with courage and be strong. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord my God is with you. He will not leave you nor abandon you until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord."
1 Chronicles 28:21 "Look, the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the ministry of the house of the Lord are with you. They will be prepared to assist you in every work with the utmost readiness. There are also those who are ready and willing with their whole heart for the ministry. For every work, you will have skilled overseers and wise men from every craft."
1 Chronicles 29:1 King David then spoke to the entire assembly: "My son Solomon, whom God has uniquely chosen for this task, is a young boy and still tender. And the work is a great one, for this sacred dwelling is not being prepared for a man, but for God Himself."
1 Chronicles 29:2 And I, with all my strength and resources, have diligently prepared the supplies for the house of my God: gold for objects of gold, silver for objects of silver, bronze for objects of bronze, iron for objects of iron, and wood for objects of wood. I have also prepared onyx stones and other precious stones for setting and inlaying, stones of various colors, and every kind of beautiful adornment, and a great deal of Parian marble.
1 Chronicles 29:3 And beyond these materials which I offered for the house of my God, from my own personal possessions I have given gold and silver for the sacred dwelling of my God, in addition to what I had already prepared.
1 Chronicles 29:4 This includes three thousand talents of pure gold, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, specifically for gilding the walls of the Temple.
1 Chronicles 29:5 Gold for gold items, silver for silver items, and for all the work requiring the hands of skilled craftsmen. And if anyone is willing to make a voluntary offering, let him consecrate his hand to the Lord today.
1 Chronicles 29:6 Therefore, the heads of the families, and the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and the commanders of thousands, and the commanders of hundreds, and the officials overseeing the king's work, all made their pledges.
1 Chronicles 29:7 And for the work of the house of the Lord, they gave five thousand talents of gold, and ten thousand gold coins, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and also one hundred thousand talents of iron.
1 Chronicles 29:8 And whoever possessed precious stones gave them into the treasuries of the house of the Lord, through the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
1 Chronicles 29:9 And the people rejoiced when they voluntarily fulfilled their vows, because they offered them to the Lord with a whole heart. King David also rejoiced with great joy.
1 Chronicles 29:10 And he blessed the Lord in the presence of the entire multitude, and said: "Blessed are You, O Lord God of Israel, our Father, from eternity to eternity."
1 Chronicles 29:11 "Yours, O Lord, is the magnificence, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and to You belongs praise. For all things that are in the universe and on the earth are Yours. Yours, O Lord, is the kingdom, and You are supreme above all rulers."
1 Chronicles 29:12 "Yours are riches, and Yours is glory. You rule over all things. In Your hand are strength and power. In Your hand is the ability to make all things great and to make all things strong."
1 Chronicles 29:13 "Now therefore, our God, we confess to You, and we praise Your glorious name."
1 Chronicles 29:14 "Who am I, and who is my people, that we should be able to promise all these things to You? For all things are Yours. And what we have received from Your hand, we have given back to You."
1 Chronicles 29:15 "For we are strangers and sojourners before You, just like all our fathers. Our days are like a shadow upon the earth, and there is no lasting permanence for us."
1 Chronicles 29:16 "O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build a house for Your holy name, it comes from Your hand, and all things are Yours."
1 Chronicles 29:17 "I know, my God, that You test hearts and that You delight in sincerity. I also, in the sincerity of my heart, have gladly offered all these things. And I have seen Your people, who are gathered here, offering gifts to You with immense joy."
1 Chronicles 29:18 "O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, preserve this intention of their hearts forever, and their enduring thoughts. And direct their hearts always toward You."
1 Chronicles 29:19 "And to my son Solomon, give a perfect heart, so that he may keep Your commandments, Your testimonies, and Your ceremonies, and that he may do all things, and build the sacred dwelling for which I have prepared everything."
1 Chronicles 29:20 Then David commanded the entire assembly: "Bless the Lord our God!" And the entire assembly blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and they bowed down and adored God, and also the king, showing respect.
1 Chronicles 29:21 And they offered sacrifices to the Lord: and they presented burnt offerings on the following day after these events—a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs with their drink offerings, and many other sacred ceremonies for all of Israel.
1 Chronicles 29:22 And they ate and drank before the Lord with great joy on that day. And they anointed Solomon, David’s son, a second time. And they anointed him to the Lord as their ruler, and Zadok as the chief priest.
1 Chronicles 29:23 So Solomon sat upon the throne of the Lord as king in place of David his father, and he pleased everyone, and all Israel obeyed him.
1 Chronicles 29:24 Furthermore, all the princes and powerful men, and all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance and subjected themselves to King Solomon.
1 Chronicles 29:25 Therefore, the Lord greatly magnified Solomon above all Israel and gave him such royal glory as no king in Israel before him had possessed.
1 Chronicles 29:26 So David, the son of Jesse, reigned over all Israel.
1 Chronicles 29:27 The days during which he reigned over Israel were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem thirty-three years.
1 Chronicles 29:28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his place.
1 Chronicles 29:29 Now the acts of King David, from the earliest to the latest, are written in the books of Samuel the seer, and in the books of Nathan the prophet, and in the books of Gad the seer.
1 Chronicles 29:30 They record all the details of his reign, his strength, and the times that passed under him, both in Israel and in all the kingdoms of the lands around them.
2 Chronicles 1:1 So Solomon, David's son, was firmly established in his kingdom. The Lord his God was with him, and He elevated him to a position of supreme greatness.
2 Chronicles 1:2 Then Solomon gave orders to all Israel, to the tribunes, centurions, leaders, and all the judges of Israel, and to the chiefs of the family clans.
2 Chronicles 1:3 And he went with the entire assembly to the high place of Gibeon, where the Tabernacle of the Covenant of God was located, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had made in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles 1:4 But David had already brought the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, and where they had pitched a tent for it—that is, in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 1:5 Also, the bronze altar which Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the Tabernacle of the Lord. And Solomon and the entire assembly sought guidance from the Lord there.
2 Chronicles 1:6 And Solomon went up to the bronze altar, which was before the Tabernacle of the Covenant of the Lord, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
2 Chronicles 1:7 Then, during that very night, God appeared to him, saying: "Ask for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you."
2 Chronicles 1:8 And Solomon said: "You have shown great mercy to David my father, and You have made me king in his place."
2 Chronicles 1:9 Now therefore, O Lord God, let Your promise which You spoke to David my father be fulfilled. For You have made me king over Your great people, who are as innumerable as the dust of the earth.
2 Chronicles 1:10 Grant me wisdom and understanding, so that I may properly lead and govern Your people. For You are the Judge of this vast multitude of Your people.
2 Chronicles 1:11 So God said to Solomon: "Because this desire was in your heart, and you did not ask for riches, possessions, or glory, nor the lives of those who hate you, nor even for many years of life; but instead you asked for wisdom and knowledge to judge My people, over whom I have made you king:
2 Chronicles 1:12 wisdom and knowledge are now given to you. Moreover, I will also give you riches, possessions, and glory, such that no king before you or after you will ever be your equal."
2 Chronicles 1:13 So Solomon returned from the high place of Gibeon to Jerusalem, and appeared before the Tabernacle of Testimony, and he reigned over Israel.
2 Chronicles 1:14 He then gathered chariots and horsemen for himself, so that he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. He stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 1:15 The king made silver and gold as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedars as abundant as the sycamore trees that grow in the plains.
2 Chronicles 1:16 Horses were also brought for him from Egypt and from Coa. The king's traders bought them from Coa at a set price.
2 Chronicles 1:17 They would import a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty. Likewise, through their hands, they were supplied to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.

2 Chronicles 2:1 King Solomon resolved to build a Temple for the Lord God, and also a palace for himself.
2 Chronicles 2:2 So Solomon counted out 70,000 men to be burden-bearers, and 80,000 men to quarry stones in the mountains, along with 3,600 foremen to supervise them.
2 Chronicles 2:3 He also sent a message to Hiram, king of Tyre, saying: "Just as you helped my father David and sent him cedar timbers to build a palace for himself, a dwelling where he lived,
2 Chronicles 2:4 do the same for me, so that I can build a Temple for the name of the Lord my God. I will consecrate it to Him, and before Him I will burn fragrant incense, and always set out the Bread of the Presence. I will offer burnt offerings morning and evening, and on Sabbaths, new moons, and the solemn feasts of the Lord our God for all time. For these are the required rituals of Israel."
2 Chronicles 2:5 "The Temple that I wish to build is magnificent, because our God is truly greater than all other gods."
2 Chronicles 2:6 "Who then could truly succeed in building a worthy Temple for Him? If the universe and the highest heavens cannot contain Him, how could I possibly build a house for Him? It is only to be a place for burning incense before Him."
2 Chronicles 2:7 "Now, therefore, send me a skilled artisan who knows how to work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and with purple, scarlet, and blue dyes. He must also be skilled in all kinds of engraving, to work alongside the artisans I already have here in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David prepared."
2 Chronicles 2:8 "Also, send me timbers of cedar, cypress, and pine from Lebanon, for I know that your servants are skilled in felling timber there. My servants will work alongside your servants,
2 Chronicles 2:9 so that they can prepare a great quantity of timber for me. For the Temple that I plan to build will be exceedingly great and glorious."
2 Chronicles 2:10 "Furthermore, I will provide your timber-cutting servants with provisions: 20,000 measures of wheat, 20,000 measures of barley, 20,000 measures of wine, and 20,000 measures of oil."
2 Chronicles 2:11 Then Hiram, king of Tyre, sent a letter in reply to Solomon, which said: "Because the Lord loves His people, He has made you king over them."
2 Chronicles 2:12 He added: "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who created the universe and the earth! He has given King David a wise and skilled son, full of discernment and understanding, to build a Temple for the Lord and a palace for himself."
2 Chronicles 2:13 "Therefore I have sent you a highly skilled and knowledgeable artisan, Hiram—my master craftsman."
2 Chronicles 2:14 "He is the son of a woman from the tribe of Dan, and his father was a Tyrian. He is skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and with purple, blue, fine linen, and scarlet fabrics. He also knows how to execute every kind of engraving and to skillfully devise whatever is needed for any work, alongside your artisans and the artisans of my lord David, your father."
2 Chronicles 2:15 "Now then, my lord, send to your servants the wheat, barley, oil, and wine that you promised."
2 Chronicles 2:16 "For our part, we will cut timber from Lebanon as much as is needed, and we will bring it in rafts by sea to Joppa. It will then be your responsibility to transport it from there to Jerusalem."
2 Chronicles 2:17 So Solomon then took a census of all the foreign residents who were in the land of Israel, following the count that his father David had previously made, and he found there were 153,600 such men.
2 Chronicles 2:18 And from these men, he appointed 70,000 to be burden-bearers, 80,000 to quarry stones in the mountains, and 3,600 to serve as overseers for the work of the people.
2 Chronicles 3:1 So King Solomon began to build the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah. This was the very site that had been revealed to his father David, in the exact place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
2 Chronicles 3:2 He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles 3:3 These are the foundational measurements that King Solomon laid out for building the Temple of God: the length was sixty cubits, and the width was twenty cubits.
2 Chronicles 3:4 The vestibule that was at the front of the Temple was twenty cubits long, matching the width of the main building, and its height was one hundred twenty cubits. He covered its interior with pure gold.
2 Chronicles 3:5 He covered the main Temple hall with fir wood planks, and he decorated it with plates of the purest gold. On these surfaces, he carved palm trees and ornamental chains in relief.
2 Chronicles 3:6 He also laid the floor of the Temple with the most precious gold, and he covered the walls with planks.
2 Chronicles 3:7 He covered the Temple building itself, along with its coffered ceilings, doorposts, and doors, with gold. And on these surfaces, he carved cherubim.
2 Chronicles 3:8 He also made the Most Holy Place. Its length was twenty cubits, matching the width of the main hall, and its width was likewise twenty cubits. He covered it with plates of the finest gold, using approximately six hundred talents of gold for this.
2 Chronicles 3:9 He also made golden nails, each weighing fifty shekels. He covered the inner sections of the Temple with gold.
2 Chronicles 3:10 He also made two sculpted cherubim in the Most Holy Place and covered them with gold.
2 Chronicles 3:11 The wings of the cherubim each measured twenty cubits in total span. One wing, ten cubits long, stretched to touch the wall of the Temple, while the other wing, also ten cubits long, reached to touch the wing of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles 3:12 Similarly, one wing of the other cherub, ten cubits long, extended to the wall, and its other wing, also ten cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub.
2 Chronicles 3:13 Thus, the wings of both cherubim, when fully spread, spanned the entire twenty-cubit width of the Most Holy Place. The cherubim themselves stood upright on their feet, and their faces were turned towards the main hall of the Temple.
2 Chronicles 3:14 He also made a veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen, and skillfully wove cherubim into its design.
2 Chronicles 3:15 In front of the Temple entrance, he also made two columns, each thirty-five cubits high, with their capitals each five cubits high.
2 Chronicles 3:16 He also made chains for the embellishment of the Temple entrance and placed them on the tops of the columns. He also made one hundred pomegranates and interspersed them among the chains.
2 Chronicles 3:17 He then set these columns in the Temple vestibule, one on the right side and the other on the left side. He named the column on the right 'Jachin', and the column on the left 'Boaz'.

2 Chronicles 4:1 Solomon also made a bronze altar. It was twenty cubits (approximately 18 inches each) in length, twenty cubits in width, and ten cubits in height.
2 Chronicles 4:2 Then he made the great Molten Sea (a large basin) for ritual washing. It was circular, ten cubits from rim to rim, and five cubits high. A measuring cord of thirty cubits could encompass its entire circumference.
2 Chronicles 4:3 Beneath its rim were decorative figures resembling oxen. These new sculptures were cast as part of a continuous band encircling the Molten Sea, with ten figures per cubit of its circumference, forming a relief decoration.
2 Chronicles 4:4 Twelve oxen supported the Molten Sea. Three of these oxen faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The Molten Sea rested upon their backs, with their hindquarters hidden beneath it.
2 Chronicles 4:5 The walls of the Molten Sea were four fingers thick. Its rim was shaped like the rim of a cup, flaring out like a lily blossom. It was designed to hold three thousand liquid measures.
2 Chronicles 4:6 He also made ten lavers (smaller basins). He placed five of these lavers on the right side of the temple and five on the left. These were for washing the animals designated for burnt offerings, so that all parts pertaining to the sacrifice would be purified there. The large Molten Sea, however, was reserved for the ritual ablutions of the priests and Levites.
2 Chronicles 4:7 Solomon also had ten golden candlesticks made, crafted according to the precise form God had commanded. He placed them within the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.
2 Chronicles 4:8 He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple: five on the right and five on the left. In addition, he made one hundred golden bowls (or basins).
2 Chronicles 4:9 He also constructed the inner court for the priests, and the great outer court. The doors for these courts were covered with bronze.
2 Chronicles 4:10 Furthermore, he placed the Molten Sea on the right side of the temple, in the eastern part, facing south.
2 Chronicles 4:11 So Hiram, the master craftsman, made all the necessary pots, shovels, and basins. He completed all the work the king had entrusted him with for the House of God.
2 Chronicles 4:12 Hiram crafted the two large bronze pillars, along with their decorative crowns and chapiters, which were placed above the pillar tops. He also made four latticework networks, designed to cover both the two crowns and the chapiters that adorned the tops of the pillars.
2 Chronicles 4:13 Additionally, he made four hundred pomegranates for the two networks. These were arranged in two rows of pomegranates that encircled each of the crowns and the chapiters of the pillars.
2 Chronicles 4:14 Moreover, Hiram made the movable stands for the lavers, and the lavers themselves, which were placed upon these stands.
2 Chronicles 4:15 He made the one large Molten Sea, along with the twelve oxen positioned beneath it.
2 Chronicles 4:16 He also crafted the pots, shovels, and fleshhooks. All these vessels, which Hiram made for King Solomon for the House of the Lord, were fashioned from the purest bronze.
2 Chronicles 4:17 The king cast these bronze items in the clay ground throughout the region of the Jordan, specifically between Succoth and Zeredah.
2 Chronicles 4:18 Solomon had all these vessels made in exceedingly great quantity. Indeed, the total weight of the bronze could not be calculated.
2 Chronicles 4:19 So Solomon commissioned and had made all the furnishings for the House of God: the golden altar of incense, and the tables upon which the showbread (or bread of the Presence) was placed.
2 Chronicles 4:20 He also had the candlesticks made with their lamps, so that they might shine before the entrance of the inner sanctuary, according to the prescribed custom. These were made from the purest gold.
2 Chronicles 4:21 And he had all the decorative golden flowers (blossoms), and the lamps themselves, and the golden tongs made from the purest gold.
2 Chronicles 4:22 He also made the golden bowls, censers, and sprinkling basins. Additionally, he made the golden doors for the inner temple leading to the Holy of Holies, and the golden doors for the main entrance of the outer temple. All these things Hiram contributed to the making of for the House of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 5:1 Thus, all the work that Solomon did for the house of the Lord was completed. And Solomon brought in all the things that his father David had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and all the various vessels—and placed them in the treasuries of the house of God.
2 Chronicles 5:2 After this, Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, all the chiefs of the tribes, and the heads of the families of the sons of Israel, in Jerusalem. He gathered them to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion.
2 Chronicles 5:3 So all the men of Israel came together to the king on the solemn feast day of the seventh month.
2 Chronicles 5:4 When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites carried the ark.
2 Chronicles 5:5 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the testimony, and all the sacred vessels that were in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites carried these items.
2 Chronicles 5:6 But King Solomon, and the entire assembly of Israel who had gathered before him, in front of the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen beyond all counting. For the multitude of the sacrificial offerings was so great.
2 Chronicles 5:7 Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its designated place—that is, into the inner sanctuary of the Temple, into the Holy of Holies, beneath the wings of the cherubim.
2 Chronicles 5:8 For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, thereby protecting both the ark itself and its carrying poles.
2 Chronicles 5:9 Now, as for the poles by which the ark was carried, because they were somewhat long, their ends were visible from outside the inner sanctuary, from the place before the Holy Place, but they did not protrude further into view. The ends of the other poles were not visible at all. Therefore, the ark remained there until the present day.
2 Chronicles 5:10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses had placed there at Horeb. This was when the Lord gave the Law to the children of Israel as they were coming out of Egypt.
2 Chronicles 5:11 Now the priests departed from the sanctuary. All the priests who were present had sanctified themselves for service, for at that time, the division of families and their assigned ministries was not yet strictly observed.
2 Chronicles 5:12 The Levites, who also served as singers—namely, those under Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, along with their sons and their relatives—were dressed in fine linen. They stood with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, making music, positioned on the east side of the altar. With them were one hundred and twenty priests, blowing trumpets.
2 Chronicles 5:13 So, when all of them were sounding in unison—with trumpets, and voices, and cymbals, and other instruments, and all sorts of musicians playing together—they raised their voices high according to the melodies of the songs. They were giving thanks to the Lord, saying 'For He is good, for His mercy endures forever.' Then the house of the Lord was filled with a cloud of the Lord's majesty—a visible manifestation of God’s glory.
2 Chronicles 5:14 And the priests were not able to stand and minister there because of the dense cloud and darkness. For the glory of the Lord had completely filled the house of God.
2 Chronicles 6:1 Then Solomon spoke, saying: “The Lord has indeed declared that He would dwell within thick, mysterious darkness.”
2 Chronicles 6:2 But I have built a sacred house to honor Your Name, so that Your presence may dwell there always and eternally.
2 Chronicles 6:3 And the king turned his attention and faced the entire assembly of Israel, and he blessed them. All of the people of Israel were standing at this time.
2 Chronicles 6:4 And Solomon said: 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who spoke with His own mouth to my father David, and has now fulfilled His promise through His actions, saying:'
2 Chronicles 6:5 'From the day I led My people out of the land of Egypt, I did not choose any city from all the tribes of Israel for a house to be built in it for My Name. Nor did I choose any man to be a leader over My people, Israel.'
2 Chronicles 6:6 'But I chose Jerusalem for My Name to be there always, and I chose David to rule over My people, Israel.'
2 Chronicles 6:7 And my father David desired to build a house to honor the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 6:8 However, the Lord said to him: 'Because you desired to build a house for My Name, you did well in having this intention in your heart.'
2 Chronicles 6:9 'Nevertheless, you yourself shall not build the house. Instead, your son, who will come forth from your body, he shall build the house for My Name.'
2 Chronicles 6:10 So the Lord has fulfilled His word which He had spoken. And I have risen up in place of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, just as the Lord had promised. And I have built this house for the Name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 6:11 And within this house, I have placed the Ark of the Covenant, in which is the covenant of the Lord that He made with the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles 6:12 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord, facing the entire assembly of Israel, and he stretched out his hands.
2 Chronicles 6:13 For Solomon had previously built a bronze platform and placed it in the middle of the outer courtyard. This platform was five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high. Solomon then stood upon it, and before the entire assembly of Israel, he knelt down upon his knees and lifted his hands towards the sky.
2 Chronicles 6:14 And he said: 'O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like You, neither in the sky nor on the earth! You faithfully keep Your covenant and show mercy to Your servants who walk before You with all their heart.
2 Chronicles 6:15 You have fulfilled for Your servant David, my father, what You spoke to him, and You have brought it to pass through Your actions, just as it is proven this very day.
2 Chronicles 6:16 Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for Your servant David, my father, what You spoke to him, saying: “There shall never fail to be a man from you before My sight, who sits upon the throne of Israel, provided that your sons guard My ways and walk in My law, just as you have walked before Me.”'
2 Chronicles 6:17 'And now, O Lord, God of Israel, let Your word be confirmed, which You spoke to Your servant David.'
2 Chronicles 6:18 'But is it truly to be believed that God would actually dwell with human beings upon the earth? For if the sky and the highest heavens cannot contain You, how much less can this house that I have built?'
2 Chronicles 6:19 'However, this house has been built only for this purpose: that You would look upon the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Lord, my God, and that You would hear the praise and the prayer that Your servant prays before You.'
2 Chronicles 6:20 'May Your eyes be open upon this house day and night, upon this place where You promised that Your Name would be invoked.'
2 Chronicles 6:21 'May You hear the prayers that Your servant and Your people Israel pray in this place. And hear us from Your exalted dwelling place, from the very sky, and when You hear us, be merciful.'
2 Chronicles 6:22 'If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is imposed upon him, compelling him to swear against himself, and each one comes to Your altar in this house, and there curses himself to attest to his innocence;'
2 Chronicles 6:23 'then You shall hear from the sky, and You shall execute judgment. You will judge Your servants, returning to the wicked man his own way, and justifying the righteous man, repaying him according to his own justice.'
2 Chronicles 6:24 'If an enemy attacks Your people Israel, and they turn to You and supplicate You in this house, confessing Your Name;'
2 Chronicles 6:25 'then You shall hear from the sky, and be merciful to the sins of Your people Israel, and bring them back into the land that You gave to their fathers.'
2 Chronicles 6:26 'If the sky is closed, and rain does not fall because of their sins, and they supplicate You in this place, and confess Your Name, and turn from their sins, when You have afflicted them;'
2 Chronicles 6:27 'then You shall hear from the sky, O Lord, and be merciful to the sins of Your servants and of Your people Israel, and teach them the good way in which they ought to walk. And give rain to Your land, which You gave to Your people as a possession.'
2 Chronicles 6:28 'If there is famine in the land, or pestilence, blight, mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; or if enemies lay waste to their regions and besiege their cities at their borders: whatever plague, whatever infirmity they suffer.'
2 Chronicles 6:29 'If anyone prays, and there is a supplication from any man, or from all of Your people Israel, each person knowing his own plague and his own infirmity, and extends his hands towards this house;'
2 Chronicles 6:30 'then You shall hear from the sky, indeed, from Your exalted dwelling place, and You will be merciful. You will repay each person according to his own ways, which You know in his heart, because You alone know the hearts of the children of men.'
2 Chronicles 6:31 'This is so they may fear You and walk in Your ways all the days that they live upon the face of the earth, which You gave to our fathers.'
2 Chronicles 6:32 'Furthermore, if a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, comes from a distant land because of Your great Name, and because of Your strong hand, and Your outstretched arm, and worships in this place;'
2 Chronicles 6:33 'then You shall hear from the most secure sky, Your dwelling place, and You shall do everything that foreigner asks of You. This is so that all the peoples of the earth may know Your Name and fear You, just as Your people Israel do, and acknowledge that Your Name is invoked over this house which I have built.'
2 Chronicles 6:34 'If Your people go out to war against their adversaries by the way in which You send them, and they pray to You facing this way, towards this city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your Name;'
2 Chronicles 6:35 'then You shall hear their prayer and supplications from the sky, and You shall execute judgment.'
2 Chronicles 6:36 'If they sin against You (for there is no human being who does not sin), and You become angry with them and deliver them to their enemies, and they are led captive into a distant land or a nearby one;'
2 Chronicles 6:37 'and if they turn in their heart in the land to which they were led captive, and do penance, and supplicate You in the land of their captivity, saying: “We have sinned, we have acted wickedly, we have done unjustly”;'
2 Chronicles 6:38 'and if they return to You with all their heart and all their soul, in the land of their captivity to which they were led, and they worship You facing the way of their land which You gave to their fathers, and the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your Name;'
2 Chronicles 6:39 'then You shall hear their prayer and supplications from the sky, indeed, from Your most secure dwelling place, and You shall execute judgment, and You will be merciful to Your people, even though they are sinners.'
2 Chronicles 6:40 'Now, O Lord, my God, I beseech You, let Your eyes be open, and Your ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.'
2 Chronicles 7:1 When Solomon had finished offering his prayers, a great fire came down from the sky. This fire consumed the burnt offerings and all the other sacrifices, and the Lord's glory filled the Temple.
2 Chronicles 7:2 The priests were unable to enter the Lord's Temple, because the magnificent glory of the Lord had completely filled the entire Temple.
2 Chronicles 7:3 All the children of Israel also saw the fire come down and the Lord's glory resting upon the Temple. They bowed low, with their faces to the ground, and adored and praised the Lord, exclaiming: 'He is good, and His mercy endures for all eternity!'
2 Chronicles 7:4 Then King Solomon and all the people began to offer sacrifices before the Lord.
2 Chronicles 7:5 So King Solomon offered as sacrifices twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. In this way, the king and all the people dedicated the Temple of God.
2 Chronicles 7:6 The priests stood in their appointed places, and the Levites were there with the musical instruments of the Lord that King David had made to praise the Lord with the hymn 'For His mercy endures forever.' The Levites were singing David's hymns with their instruments, while the priests blew trumpets before them. All of Israel stood reverently during this.
2 Chronicles 7:7 Solomon also consecrated the middle section of the courtyard, the part directly in front of the Lord's Temple. This was because he had offered burnt offerings there, along with the fat from the peace offerings, as the bronze altar Solomon had made was not large enough to hold all the burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fat.
2 Chronicles 7:8 So Solomon celebrated a great feast for seven days at that time, and all Israel was with him—a vast multitude gathered from the far northern entrance of Hamath down to the River of Egypt in the south.
2 Chronicles 7:9 On the eighth day, they held a solemn assembly. This was after they had spent seven days completing the dedication of the altar, and then another seven days celebrating the feast.
2 Chronicles 7:10 So, on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people away to their homes. They were full of joy and cheer, grateful for all the good the Lord had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people, Israel.
2 Chronicles 7:11 Solomon thus completed the Lord's Temple and his own royal palace. Everything he had planned in his heart to build for the Lord's Temple and for his own house, he successfully brought to a prosperous completion.
2 Chronicles 7:12 The Lord appeared to Solomon during the night and said: 'I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this very place for Myself to be a house of sacrifice.'
2 Chronicles 7:13 If I were to close up the sky so that no rain falls, or if I were to command the locusts to devour the earth, or if I were to send a plague among My people, these would be the consequences of their actions.
2 Chronicles 7:14 If My people, who are called by My name, turn away from their wicked ways, and pray to Me, and seek My face, and repent, then I will hear them from My dwelling place above. I will forgive their sins, and I will heal their land.
2 Chronicles 7:15 My eyes will also be open, and My ears attentive to the prayer of anyone who prays in this very place, the Temple.
2 Chronicles 7:16 For I have chosen and sanctified this place, so that My name may be there forever. My eyes and My heart will remain there perpetually.
2 Chronicles 7:17 As for you, if you walk before Me just as David your father walked, and you do everything I have commanded you, and you uphold My judgments and My commandments, then I will bless your reign.
2 Chronicles 7:18 I will establish your royal throne, just as I promised David your father, saying: 'There shall never fail a man of your lineage to rule over Israel.'
2 Chronicles 7:19 But if you turn away and forsake My commandments and My sacred ceremonies, which I have given you, and instead go and serve foreign gods and worship them, then dire consequences will follow.
2 Chronicles 7:20 I will uproot you from My land, which I have given to you. And this Temple, which I have sanctified for My name, I will cast away from My sight. I will make it a proverb and a byword among all nations.
2 Chronicles 7:21 And this Temple will become a proverb to all who pass by. They will say: 'Why has the Lord done this to this land and to this Temple?'
2 Chronicles 7:22 And the answer will be: 'Because they abandoned the Lord God of their fathers, who led them out of the land of Egypt. They embraced foreign gods, worshipped them, and served them. That is why all these terrible evils have come upon them.'
2 Chronicles 8:1 After twenty years, during which King Solomon built the Lord's Temple and his own royal palace,
2 Chronicles 8:2 King Solomon then rebuilt the cities that King Hiram had given to him, and he settled the people of Israel there.
2 Chronicles 8:3 King Solomon also went to Hamath-Zobah and took possession of it.
2 Chronicles 8:4 He built up Tadmor in the desert, as well as all the store cities that he had established in Hamath.
2 Chronicles 8:5 He also rebuilt Upper Beth-Horon and Lower Beth-Horon, fortifying them as cities with walls, gates, and strong bars for security.
2 Chronicles 8:6 He likewise rebuilt Baalath and all the other fortified cities that belonged to King Solomon. He built all the cities for his chariots, the cities for his cavalry, and everything else that King Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and throughout all the lands under his control.
2 Chronicles 8:7 All the people who remained from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—those who were not from the lineage of Israel—
2 Chronicles 8:8 whose descendants were left in the land, and whom the people of Israel had not destroyed completely—King Solomon made them perform forced labor, and they continue to pay tribute to this very day.
2 Chronicles 8:9 However, King Solomon did not make any of the people of Israel perform such forced royal labor. For they were his soldiers, his chief officers, his commanders of chariots, and his cavalry.
2 Chronicles 8:10 All the chief officers of King Solomon's army numbered two hundred fifty men, and these were the ones who instructed the people.
2 Chronicles 8:11 King Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter from the City of David into the royal palace he had built for her. For the king said: "My wife must not live in the house of King David of Israel, because that place is made holy, for the Ark of the Lord has entered it."
2 Chronicles 8:12 Then King Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord upon the Lord's altar, which he had built in front of the Temple portico.
2 Chronicles 8:13 He did this so that the daily prescribed offerings would be fulfilled according to the ritual requirements for the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the three annual solemn feasts: namely, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles.
2 Chronicles 8:14 He appointed the priests to their designated duties according to the arrangement of his father, King David, and the Levites to their various orders, to offer praise and to minister before the priests according to the ritual of each day. He also appointed the gatekeepers to their divisions for each gate, for so had David, the man of God, commanded.
2 Chronicles 8:15 The priests and Levites did not deviate from any of the king's commands concerning all that he had ordered, whether for the treasuries or for the daily service.
2 Chronicles 8:16 Thus, all of King Solomon's work was completed, from the day the Lord's Temple was founded until the day it was finished.
2 Chronicles 8:17 At that time, King Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Elath, which are on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom.
2 Chronicles 8:18 King Hiram then sent ships to King Solomon by the hand of his servants, along with sailors who were skilled in seafaring. These sailors, with King Solomon's servants, went to Ophir and brought back from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
2 Chronicles 9:1 The Queen of Sheba, having heard of King Solomon’s great fame and wisdom, came to Jerusalem to test him with many difficult questions. She arrived with a magnificent procession, including camels carrying a vast amount of spices, very much gold, and many precious jewels. When she was brought before Solomon, she spoke to him about everything she had pondered in her heart.
2 Chronicles 9:2 But King Solomon explained to her every question she had presented. There was nothing he did not answer clearly, showing his great wisdom.
2 Chronicles 9:3 Therefore, the Queen of Sheba personally observed the profound wisdom of King Solomon. She also saw the magnificent royal palace that he had built for himself.
2 Chronicles 9:4 She observed the lavish food served at his royal table, the orderly living quarters of his servants, the meticulous service and splendid clothing of his ministers, and the excellent service and attire of his cupbearers. She also witnessed the magnificent burnt offerings that King Solomon regularly presented in the Temple of the Lord. All these sights were so overwhelming that she was left utterly astonished and completely breathless.
2 Chronicles 9:5 She then said to the king: “The report I heard in my own land concerning your accomplishments and your wisdom is truly accurate.
2 Chronicles 9:6 I did not believe those who told me, until I came myself and saw with my own eyes. Now I see that not even half of your wisdom had been reported to me; your actual achievements far exceed your reputation.”
2 Chronicles 9:7 Blessed are your men who serve you, and blessed are your female servants who always stand before you and listen to your wisdom. They are truly fortunate.
2 Chronicles 9:8 May the Lord your God be blessed, for He was pleased to place you upon His throne, making you king for the Lord your God. He has done this so you may execute judgment and administer justice for His people.
2 Chronicles 9:9 Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, an extremely large quantity of spices, and many very precious gems. Never before had there been such a great quantity of spices as the Queen of Sheba gave to Solomon.
2 Chronicles 9:10 Moreover, Hiram’s servants, along with Solomon’s own servants, brought gold from Ophir. They also brought sandalwood — a very fine timber — and highly valuable gems.
2 Chronicles 9:11 From this precious timber, the king made steps for the Temple of the Lord and for the royal palace. He also made lyres and harps for the musicians. Nothing like these had ever been seen before in the land of Judah.
2 Chronicles 9:12 King Solomon also gave the Queen of Sheba everything she desired and requested from him, in addition to what she had brought to him as gifts. After receiving these, she returned and departed to her own land with her servants.
2 Chronicles 9:13 Now, the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon each year amounted to six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold.
2 Chronicles 9:14 This was in addition to what laypeople and merchants brought, and what all the kings of Arabia and the governors of various lands contributed by bringing gold and silver to Solomon.
2 Chronicles 9:15 So King Solomon made two hundred large shields — or spears — of beaten gold. Each one contained six hundred shekels of gold.
2 Chronicles 9:16 He also made three hundred smaller shields of beaten gold; each of these contained three hundred shekels of gold. The king placed these in the armory that was known as the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
2 Chronicles 9:17 The king also made a large ivory throne, which he overlaid with the purest gold.
2 Chronicles 9:18 There were six steps leading up to the throne. There was also a golden footstool permanently attached to the throne. It had armrests on both sides, and two statues of lions stood beside these armrests.
2 Chronicles 9:19 Additionally, twelve lion cubs stood on the six steps, one on each side of each step. There was no throne like it in any of the kingdoms of the world.
2 Chronicles 9:20 All the drinking vessels used for King Solomon’s banquets were made of gold. And all the utensils and furnishings in the House of the Forest of Lebanon were made of pure gold. In those days, silver was considered to be of no value.
2 Chronicles 9:21 This was because the king’s ships sailed to Tarshish with Hiram’s servants once every three years. From there, they brought back gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
2 Chronicles 9:22 So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in both his immense wealth and his profound wisdom.
2 Chronicles 9:23 All the kings of the earth sought to meet Solomon personally, so they could hear the wisdom that God had placed in his heart.
2 Chronicles 9:24 Each one of them brought him gifts: articles of silver and gold, splendid garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, year after year.
2 Chronicles 9:25 Solomon also had forty thousand stalls for his horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. These were stationed in the chariot cities and also with the king in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 9:26 He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River, extending as far as the land of the Philistines, and all the way to the borders of Egypt.
2 Chronicles 9:27 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as ordinary stones. And he made cedar wood as abundant as the sycamore trees that grow in great numbers in the lowlands.
2 Chronicles 9:28 Horses were brought to him from Egypt and from all other regions.
2 Chronicles 9:29 Now, the rest of the acts of Solomon, both his early and his later deeds, are recorded in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the books of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.
2 Chronicles 9:30 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.
2 Chronicles 9:31 Then Solomon rested with his ancestors in death, and they buried him in the City of David. His son Rehoboam then became king in his place.
2 Chronicles 10:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem. This was because all of Israel had come there to make him king.
2 Chronicles 10:2 Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, heard about this. He had been in Egypt, having fled there from King Solomon. He immediately returned from Egypt.
2 Chronicles 10:3 So they sent for him and called him. Jeroboam came, and all of Israel came with him. They spoke to Rehoboam, saying:
2 Chronicles 10:4 'Your father made our forced labor very hard. Now, lighten a little of this very harsh service and the heavy burden he put on us, and we will serve you.'
2 Chronicles 10:5 He answered them, saying, 'Return to me after three days.' So the people went away.
2 Chronicles 10:6 King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had advised his father, King Solomon, during his lifetime. He asked them, 'What advice do you give me so I can respond to these people?'
2 Chronicles 10:7 They said to him, 'If you will be good to this people, and will please them by speaking gentle words to them, they will be your servants always.'
2 Chronicles 10:8 But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders. Instead, he spoke with the young men who had grown up with him and were always around him.
2 Chronicles 10:9 He asked them, 'What advice do you give? How should I answer these people who have asked me to lighten the heavy burden that my father placed on us?'
2 Chronicles 10:10 The young men answered him, giving their advice: 'Tell the people who spoke to you, saying, "Your father made our forced labor heavy, but you lighten it," say this to them: "My little finger is thicker than my father's loins."'
2 Chronicles 10:11 'And now, my father placed a heavy burden on you, but I will make it even heavier. My father punished you with regular whips, but I will punish you with whips that have sharp points.'
2 Chronicles 10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had commanded when he said, 'Return to me on the third day.'
2 Chronicles 10:13 The king answered them harshly, having rejected the good counsel given by the elders.
2 Chronicles 10:14 And he spoke according to the wishes of the young men, saying, 'My father placed a heavy burden on you, but I will add even more to it. My father punished you with regular whips, but I will punish you with whips that have sharp points.'
2 Chronicles 10:15 But King Rehoboam did not listen to the people's plea. This turn of events was from God, so that the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam, son of Nebat, might be fulfilled.
2 Chronicles 10:16 When all of Israel saw that King Rehoboam refused to listen to them, the people answered him, saying, 'We have no share in David! We have no inheritance with the son of Jesse—that is, King David! Go to your own homes, Israel! You, David, see to your own house now.' And all the people of Israel went to their homes.
2 Chronicles 10:17 But Rehoboam still reigned over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles 10:18 Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of the forced labor. But the people of Israel stoned him to death. So King Rehoboam quickly got into his chariot and fled to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 10:19 And Israel has been separated from the house of David from that day until the present.
2 Chronicles 11:1 After this, Rehoboam went to Jerusalem. He called together all the fighting men from the Tribe of Judah and the Tribe of Benjamin—one hundred and eighty thousand chosen warriors—so that he could fight against the northern kingdom of Israel and bring it back under his rule.
2 Chronicles 11:2 Then the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, a prophet of God, saying:
2 Chronicles 11:3  'Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon and king of Judah, and to all the Israelites who are living in the territories of Judah and Benjamin:
2 Chronicles 11:4  'The Lord says this: Do not march up to fight against your own brothers, the northern Israelites. Everyone should return to his own home, because this division happened by My will.' So, when they heard the Lord's message, they turned back from their campaign and did not go to war against Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles 11:5 Rehoboam then stayed in Jerusalem and built fortified cities throughout Judah.
2 Chronicles 11:6 He built up Bethlehem, Etham, and Tekoa,
2 Chronicles 11:7 as well as Beth-zur, Soco, and Adullam,
2 Chronicles 11:8 and also Gath, Mareshah, and Ziph,
2 Chronicles 11:9 along with Adoraim, Lachish, and Azekah,
2 Chronicles 11:10 and Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were strong, fortified cities in the territories of Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles 11:11 After fortifying these cities, he put commanders in charge of them and stored supplies of food, including olive oil and wine.
2 Chronicles 11:12 In each of these cities, he also placed shields and spears, making them extremely well-fortified. So, he established his reign over Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles 11:13 Also, the priests and the Levites who lived throughout all the regions of the northern kingdom of Israel came to him [in Judah].
2 Chronicles 11:14 They left their pasture lands and their possessions, crossing over into Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons refused to let them serve as priests of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 11:15 Instead, Jeroboam had appointed his own priests for the pagan high places, for idol worship, and for the calf idols which he had made.
2 Chronicles 11:16 Moreover, from all the tribes of the northern kingdom of Israel, anyone who earnestly sought to worship the Lord, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
2 Chronicles 11:17 Thus, the kingdom of Judah was strengthened, and Rehoboam, Solomon's son, was established in power for three years, because for those three years, they followed in the ways of David and Solomon.
2 Chronicles 11:18 Rehoboam then married Mahalath, who was the daughter of Jerimoth, David's son. He also married Abihail, who was the daughter of Eliab, Jesse's son.
2 Chronicles 11:19 She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
2 Chronicles 11:20 After this, he also married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
2 Chronicles 11:21 Rehoboam loved Maacah, Absalom's daughter, more than all his other wives and concubines. Indeed, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and through them, he became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
2 Chronicles 11:22 He appointed Abijah, Maacah's son, as the chief leader among all his brothers, intending to make him king.
2 Chronicles 11:23 Therefore, Rehoboam wisely made arrangements and distributed all his sons throughout all the regions of Judah and Benjamin, placing them in fortified cities. He gave them generous provisions and also many wives.
2 Chronicles 12:1 Once Rehoboam’s kingdom had become strong and established, he abandoned the Lord, and all of Israel followed him in this sin.
2 Chronicles 12:2 In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem because Rehoboam and Israel had abandoned the Lord. Shishak came with two hundred forty chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. The number of foot soldiers who came with him from Egypt was countless; this army included Libyans, Troglodytes, and Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles 12:3 He captured the fortified cities in Judah and advanced all the way to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 12:4 Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah, who had gathered in Jerusalem, having fled from Shishak. He told them, 'Thus says the Lord: You have abandoned me, and for that reason, I have now abandoned you into the power of Shishak.'
2 Chronicles 12:5 Then Rehoboam and the princes of Israel humbled themselves and declared, 'The Lord is just in this judgment.'
2 Chronicles 12:6 When the Lord saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying: 'Because they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them. Instead, I will grant them a little help, and my wrath will not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.'
2 Chronicles 12:7 Nevertheless, they will become Shishak’s servants, so that they may understand the difference between serving me and serving the kingdoms of this world.
2 Chronicles 12:8 So Shishak, the king of Egypt, entered Jerusalem and took away the treasures from the house of the Lord and the royal palace treasures. He carried everything away with him, including the golden shields that Solomon had made.
2 Chronicles 12:9 In place of these, King Rehoboam made bronze shields and entrusted them to the commanders of the guards and those who guarded the palace gates.
2 Chronicles 12:10 Whenever the king entered the house of the Lord, the guards would carry these shields, and afterwards, they would return them to their armory.
2 Chronicles 12:11 Nevertheless, because Rehoboam had humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned away from him; his realm was not utterly destroyed. Indeed, there were still some good deeds found among the people of Judah.
2 Chronicles 12:12 So King Rehoboam strengthened his position in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to have His name invoked there.
2 Chronicles 12:13 His mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
2 Chronicles 12:14 However, Rehoboam did evil, and he did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord.
2 Chronicles 12:15 Now, the first and last deeds of Rehoboam are written in the books of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer. These accounts were written with diligent detail, including genealogies. There was also continuous warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout all their days.
2 Chronicles 12:16 So Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. His son Abijah then reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 12:17 In the eighteenth year of Jeroboam’s reign, Abijah began to reign over Judah.
2 Chronicles 12:18 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah, daughter of Uriel, from Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles 12:19 When the battle lines were drawn, Abijah went forth with four hundred thousand very strong and skilled warriors. Jeroboam also arrayed against him an army of eight hundred thousand strong and mighty men.
2 Chronicles 12:20 Abijah then stood upon Mount Zemaraim, which is in Ephraim, and said, 'Hear me, Jeroboam, and all of Israel!'
2 Chronicles 12:21 Do you not know that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, and to his sons, by a covenant of salt? (A covenant of salt is a perpetual and unbreakable agreement).
2 Chronicles 12:22 Yet Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon, the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his own master.
2 Chronicles 12:23 Worthless men, sons of Belial, gathered to him and prevailed against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. For Rehoboam was young and faint-hearted and could not stand against them.
2 Chronicles 12:24 And now you intend to resist the kingdom of the Lord, which He possesses through the sons of David? You have a countless multitude of men, and also the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods.
2 Chronicles 12:25 Have you not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites? Instead, you have made priests for yourselves according to the customs of all the other nations. Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams becomes a priest for those who are not truly gods.
2 Chronicles 12:26 But for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not abandoned Him. The priests ministering to the Lord are from the sons of Aaron, and the Levites serve in their proper duties.
2 Chronicles 12:27 And we burn to the Lord every single day the morning and evening burnt offering, and aromatic incense. We set out the bread upon the pure table and have the golden lampstand with its lamps, so that they may be lit in the evening. For we keep the precepts of the Lord our God, but you have abandoned them.
2 Chronicles 12:28 Therefore, God is our leader in our army, and our priests are with us, to sound the trumpets and shout against you. Sons of Israel, do not fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers, for it will not go well for you.
2 Chronicles 12:29 Nevertheless, Jeroboam, by setting ambushes behind Judah's army, surrounded them. While his main army was in front, other ambushes were behind them.
2 Chronicles 12:30 So when Judah turned and saw the battle coming from both in front and behind, they cried out to the Lord, and the priests began to sound their trumpets.
2 Chronicles 12:31 Every man of Judah also shouted. And behold, while the priests blasted their trumpets and all together shouted with a mighty cry, God did not conceal Himself from their adversaries.
2 Chronicles 12:32 Therefore, God struck down Jeroboam and all of Israel in the presence of Abijah and Judah.
2 Chronicles 12:33 The sons of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.
2 Chronicles 12:34 So Abijah and his people inflicted a great slaughter, and five hundred thousand strong men of Israel fell, mortally wounded.
2 Chronicles 12:35 The sons of Israel were humbled at that time, but the sons of Judah were strengthened, because they had relied upon the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 12:36 Abijah pursued Jeroboam as he fled and captured his cities: Bethel and its surrounding towns, Jeshanah with its surrounding towns, and Ephron with its surrounding towns.
2 Chronicles 12:37 So Jeroboam could no longer regain his strength in the days of Abijah. The Lord struck him, and he died.
2 Chronicles 12:38 Now, the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his deeds, are written very diligently in the book of Iddo the prophet.
2 Chronicles 12:39 Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. His son Asa then reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 12:40 In his days, the land was at peace for ten years.
2 Chronicles 13:1 In the eighteenth year of Jeroboam's reign, Abijah began his reign over Judah.
2 Chronicles 13:2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Micaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. And there was a major war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles 13:3 Abijah prepared for battle with two hundred thousand mighty and experienced warriors. Jeroboam, on the other hand, drew up his battle line with eight hundred thousand strong and valiant men.
2 Chronicles 13:4 Then Abijah took his stand on Mount Zemaraim, which was in Ephraim, and he declared: "Hear me, Jeroboam, and all of Israel!"
2 Chronicles 13:5 Do you not know that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever—to him and his sons—by a perpetual covenant of salt?
2 Chronicles 13:6 Yet Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon, David's son, rose up and rebelled against his own master.
2 Chronicles 13:7 And worthless men, sons of utter wickedness, gathered to him and gained power against Rehoboam, Solomon's son. Rehoboam was then young and timid, and he could not resist them.
2 Chronicles 13:8 And now you say that you can resist the kingdom of the Lord, which He rules through the sons of David. You are indeed a very great multitude, but you have with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made for you as gods.
2 Chronicles 13:9 Have you not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites? And have you not made priests for yourselves according to the pagan customs of all the nations of the earth? Whoever came and consecrated himself with a young bull and seven rams became a priest for those who are not truly gods.
2 Chronicles 13:10 But the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken Him. Priests from the sons of Aaron minister to the Lord, and the Levites are in their assigned service.
2 Chronicles 13:11 They offer burnt offerings to the Lord every single day, morning and evening, along with fragrant incense. They also set out the showbread on the purest table, and they light the golden lampstand with its lamps every evening. Indeed, we keep the commands of the Lord our God, Whom you have forsaken.
2 Chronicles 13:12 Therefore, God Himself is the Leader in our army, and His priests sound the trumpets to stir up battle against you. Sons of Israel, do not fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers, because it will not go well for you.
2 Chronicles 13:13 But Jeroboam had secretly led an ambush around to attack Judah from the rear. So while one part of his army was positioned in front of Judah's camp, another part was now behind them.
2 Chronicles 13:14 Then Judah looked around, and behold, the battle lines were arrayed against them from both sides! So they cried out to the Lord, and the priests sounded the trumpets.
2 Chronicles 13:15 And all of Judah shouted with a great war cry. And behold, as they were shouting, God Himself struck terror into Jeroboam and all of Israel who had stood against Abijah and Judah.
2 Chronicles 13:16 And the sons of Israel fled before Judah, for God had delivered them into Judah's hand.
2 Chronicles 13:17 So Abijah and his people inflicted a great slaughter upon Jeroboam, and there fell slain from Israel five hundred thousand valiant men.
2 Chronicles 13:18 And the sons of Israel were humiliated at that time, but the sons of Judah were made strong, because they had relied upon the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 13:19 Abijah then pursued Jeroboam and captured his cities: Bethel with its dependent towns, Jeshanah with its dependent towns, and Ephron with its dependent towns.
2 Chronicles 13:20 Jeroboam never regained his strength again during the days of Abijah. Indeed, the Lord struck him down, and he died.
2 Chronicles 13:21 Abijah grew mighty and took fourteen wives for himself. He begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
2 Chronicles 13:22 Now the rest of Abijah's words, and his ways, and his deeds, are written most diligently in the prophetic book of Iddo the prophet.
2 Chronicles 14:1 King Abijah then died, joining his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David. His son Asa became king after him. During Asa's early reign, the land was at peace for ten years.
2 Chronicles 14:2 King Asa then did what was good and morally upright in the sight of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles 14:3 He removed the altars dedicated to foreign worship and tore down the high places. He shattered the pagan idols and cut down the Asherah poles.
2 Chronicles 14:4 He commanded the people of Judah to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and to obey His law and all His commandments.
2 Chronicles 14:5 He also removed the pagan altars and temples from all the cities of Judah. Consequently, his reign was peaceful.
2 Chronicles 14:6 He built fortified cities throughout Judah because the land was quiet, and he endured no times of conflict with anyone rising up against him. This was because the Lord had granted him a period of rest and peace.
2 Chronicles 14:7 Asa then said to the people of Judah: 'Let us build these cities, fortifying them with walls, towers, gates, and bars, so that we may remain at peace from any conflicts. We sought the Lord, and He has granted us peace all around.' So they built them and successfully completed the work.
2 Chronicles 14:8 Asa had an army composed of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with large shields and spears. From Benjamin, he had two hundred eighty thousand men who carried shields and were archers. All these were very mighty warriors.
2 Chronicles 14:9 Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with his army of two hundred ninety thousand men and three hundred chariots. He advanced as far as Mareshah.
2 Chronicles 14:10 Asa went out to meet him and arrayed his battle lines in the Valley of Zephathah, which is near Mareshah.
2 Chronicles 14:11 Asa then called out to the Lord his God, saying: 'O Lord, it makes no difference to You whether You help the few or the many. Help us, O Lord our God, for it is in You that we place our hope, and relying solely on Your help, we have come against this vast multitude. O Lord, You are our God; let no mere human prevail against Your power!'
2 Chronicles 14:12 So the Lord struck down the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
2 Chronicles 14:13 Asa and the army that was with him pursued them as far as Gerar. The Ethiopians were completely devastated, for they had been utterly terrified by the Lord and His army. Asa and his army then carried away a very great amount of plunder.
2 Chronicles 14:14 They then destroyed all the cities surrounding Gerar, striking down every shepherd's encampment, and took much plunder. They also captured an immense number of sheep and camels.
2 Chronicles 14:15 They returned to Jerusalem laden with plunder and also with a sense of awe and reverence, because the Lord had struck terror into all the cities around them.
2 Chronicles 15:1 But the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon Azariah, the son of Oded.
2 Chronicles 15:2 Azariah went out to meet King Asa and said to him, 'Listen to me, Asa, and all of Judah and Benjamin! The Lord is with you because you were with Him. If you seek Him, you will surely find Him. But if you abandon Him, then He will abandon you.'
2 Chronicles 15:3 For many years in Israel, the people had lived without the true God, without a teaching priest to guide them, and without the Law.
2 Chronicles 15:4 But in their distress, when they turned back to the Lord, the God of Israel, and truly sought Him, they found Him.
2 Chronicles 15:5 During that time, there was no peace for those who traveled, nor for those who stayed; instead, great terrors afflicted all the inhabitants of the lands. City was shattered against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
2 Chronicles 15:6 For the Lord afflicted them with every kind of distress.
2 Chronicles 15:7 Therefore, strengthen yourselves, and do not let your hands grow weak, for there will be a reward for your work.
2 Chronicles 15:8 When King Asa heard these words and the prophecy from Azariah, the son of Oded the prophet, he took courage. He removed all the idols from the entire land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He then rededicated the Lord's altar that stood before the portico of the Lord's Temple.
2 Chronicles 15:9 Then King Asa gathered all of Judah and Benjamin, along with the foreigners from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were living among them. Many people from Israel had fled to him because they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
2 Chronicles 15:10 So they all assembled in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.
2 Chronicles 15:11 On that day, from the plunder they had brought back, they sacrificed to the Lord seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles 15:12 They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and all their soul.
2 Chronicles 15:13 Anyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.
2 Chronicles 15:14 They swore an oath to the Lord with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with ram's horns.
2 Chronicles 15:15 All of Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn it with all their heart. They had sought Him with their whole desire, and He had been found by them. The Lord then gave them rest on every side.
2 Chronicles 15:16 King Asa also removed his mother, Maacah, from her position as queen mother because she had made an abominable idol for a pagan Asherah pole. Asa cut down her idol, smashed it into pieces, and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
2 Chronicles 15:17 However, the high places where pagan worship occurred were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless, Asa's heart remained fully committed to the Lord throughout his entire life.
2 Chronicles 15:18 He brought into the house of the Lord the holy gifts that his father had consecrated, along with his own gifts of silver, gold, and various vessels.
2 Chronicles 15:19 There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.
2 Chronicles 16:1 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, Baasa, the king of Israel, marched up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from entering or leaving Asa's territory.
2 Chronicles 16:2 So Asa took silver and gold from the treasuries of the Lord's Temple and from his own royal treasuries, and sent it to Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, who was living in Damascus, saying:
2 Chronicles 16:3 “Let there be an alliance between me and you, just as there was between my father and your father. Because of this, I have sent you silver and gold so that you will break your alliance with Baasa, the king of Israel, and he will withdraw his troops from my land.”
2 Chronicles 16:4 Ben-Hadad agreed to this, and he sent the commanders of his army against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.
2 Chronicles 16:5 When Baasa heard about this attack, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned his work there.
2 Chronicles 16:6 Then King Asa gathered all of Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber that Baasa had used to fortify Ramah. With these materials, Asa fortified Geba and Mizpah instead.
2 Chronicles 16:7 At that time, Hanani the prophet came to Asa, the king of Judah, and said to him: “Because you relied on the king of Syria and not on the Lord, your God, that is why the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your grasp, and you did not achieve a decisive victory.”
2 Chronicles 16:8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a great multitude with many chariots and horsemen? Yet, when you placed your trust in the Lord, He delivered them into your hand.
2 Chronicles 16:9 For the eyes of the Lord constantly survey the entire earth, and He provides strength to those whose hearts are completely devoted to Him. You have acted foolishly in this matter, and because of this, from now on, you will face wars.
2 Chronicles 16:10 Asa became enraged at the prophet and ordered him to be put in prison; indeed, the king was very angry about this prophecy. At the same time, Asa also cruelly oppressed some of the people.
2 Chronicles 16:11 As for the rest of the acts of Asa, from first to last, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 16:12 Furthermore, even in his illness, which began in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, when his feet became diseased, he did not seek the Lord in his sickness, but rather put his trust in the skill of physicians.
2 Chronicles 16:13 So Asa rested with his ancestors and died in the forty-first year of his reign.
2 Chronicles 16:14 They buried him in his own tomb, which he had carved out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bed filled with spices and various fragrant perfumes, prepared by the perfumer's art, and they burned a very large funeral pyre in his honor.
2 Chronicles 17:1 And Jehoshaphat, his son, began to reign in his place. He strengthened himself against the Northern Kingdom of Israel.
2 Chronicles 17:2 He placed military garrisons in all the fortified cities of Judah. He also stationed commanders throughout the land of Judah and in the cities of the territory of Ephraim that Asa, his father, had captured.
2 Chronicles 17:3 The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier, faithful ways of David, his ancestor, and he did not persist in worshipping the idols of Baal.
2 Chronicles 17:4 Instead, he sought the God of his father, and diligently followed His commandments, unlike the wicked practices of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.
2 Chronicles 17:5 The Lord strengthened the kingdom in his grasp, and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat. He acquired great wealth and renown.
2 Chronicles 17:6 Moreover, because his heart was devoted to the ways of the Lord, he also removed the high places of idolatry and the sacred groves dedicated to false gods from Judah.
2 Chronicles 17:7 In the third year of his reign, he sent some of his officials: Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles 17:8 With these officials, he sent the Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah. And with them, the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
2 Chronicles 17:9 They taught the law of the Lord throughout Judah, carrying the book of the law with them. They traveled through all the cities of Judah, instructing the people.
2 Chronicles 17:10 Consequently, the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the surrounding lands near Judah, so they dared not wage war against Jehoshaphat.
2 Chronicles 17:11 Even the Philistines brought gifts and silver tribute to Jehoshaphat. And the Arabs also brought him livestock: seven thousand seven hundred rams and the same number of goats.
2 Chronicles 17:12 So Jehoshaphat grew more powerful and was greatly exalted. He built fortresses and fortified cities throughout Judah.
2 Chronicles 17:13 He carried out many construction projects in the cities of Judah, and he had mighty warriors stationed in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 17:14 This is their enrollment according to their ancestral families: From Judah, the commanders of the army were Adnah the chief, and with him three hundred thousand mighty warriors.
2 Chronicles 17:15 After him, Johanan was the commander, and with him two hundred eighty thousand.
2 Chronicles 17:16 After him, Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who had consecrated himself to the Lord, and with him two hundred thousand mighty warriors.
2 Chronicles 17:17 From Benjamin, the mighty warriors were Eliada the commander, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bows and shields.
2 Chronicles 17:18 After him, Jehozabad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand prepared for war.
2 Chronicles 17:19 All these were warriors who served the king. This number does not include those whom he had placed in the fortified cities throughout all of Judah.
2 Chronicles 17:20 Note: The Clementine Vulgate for 2 Chronicles Chapter 17 concludes at verse 19. Therefore, there are no verses 20-40 to translate for this chapter. The narrative continues in Chapter 18.
2 Chronicles 18:1 Jehoshaphat had accumulated much wealth and great honor during his reign, and he formed a family alliance with Ahab, the King of Israel.
2 Chronicles 18:2 Some years later, Jehoshaphat visited Ahab in Samaria. Ahab showed him great hospitality, slaughtering a vast number of sheep and cattle in his honor, and began to entice and ensnare Jehoshaphat and the many people who had come with him into a military alliance.
2 Chronicles 18:3 Ahab, the King of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah, "Will you come with me to Ramoth-Gilead to fight?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am with you, and my people are with your people. We will be with you in this war."
2 Chronicles 18:4 Then Jehoshaphat said to the King of Israel, "Please, let us first inquire of the Lord to hear what He says about this mission."
2 Chronicles 18:5 So the King of Israel gathered four hundred men who claimed to be prophets and asked them, "Should we go to Ramoth-Gilead to fight, or should we refrain?" They all answered, "Go up, and God will give them into the hand of the king."
2 Chronicles 18:6 Jehoshaphat then asked, "Is there not a true prophet of the Lord here, from whom we can inquire directly?"
2 Chronicles 18:7 The King of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "There is one man by whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. His name is Micaiah, the son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat responded, "The king should not speak such a word against God's prophet."
2 Chronicles 18:8 So the King of Israel called one of his officials and commanded, "Bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah, quickly."
2 Chronicles 18:9 The King of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah, were both seated on their respective thrones, dressed in their royal robes, in the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria. All the false prophets were prophesying before them.
2 Chronicles 18:10 Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron and declared, "Thus says the Lord: 'With these horns you will gore the Syrians until you utterly destroy them.'"
2 Chronicles 18:11 All the other prophets also prophesied similarly, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and you will prosper; the Lord will give them into the hand of the king."
2 Chronicles 18:12 The messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, "Behold, the words of all the prophets are unanimously proclaiming good things to the king. Therefore, I beg you, let your word agree with their words, and speak what is good."
2 Chronicles 18:13 Micaiah replied, "As the Lord lives, whatever my God says, that is what I will speak."
2 Chronicles 18:14 So when Micaiah came to the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-Gilead to fight, or should we refrain?" Micaiah replied with sarcasm, "Go up and prosper, for they will be delivered into your hand!"
2 Chronicles 18:15 The king said, "I solemnly command you again and again, in the name of the Lord, that you speak nothing to me but the truth."
2 Chronicles 18:16 Then Micaiah said, "I saw all of Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, 'These have no master; let each one return to his own house in peace.'" This was a prophecy of Ahab's death and the scattering of his army.
2 Chronicles 18:17 So the King of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but only evil?"
2 Chronicles 18:18 Micaiah then added, "Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord seated on His throne, with all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left."
2 Chronicles 18:19 And the Lord asked, 'Who will deceive Ahab, the King of Israel, so that he will go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?' And while some spoke in one manner, and others in another,
2 Chronicles 18:20 a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord and said, 'I will deceive him.' The Lord asked him, 'In what way will you deceive him?'
2 Chronicles 18:21 He replied, 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his false prophets.' The Lord said, 'You will deceive him, and you will prevail. Go out and do as you have said.'"
2 Chronicles 18:22 Micaiah concluded, "Now therefore, behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the Lord has decreed evil concerning you."
2 Chronicles 18:23 Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, approached Micaiah and struck him on the cheek, saying, "Which way did the Spirit of the Lord pass from me to speak to you?"
2 Chronicles 18:24 Micaiah replied, "You yourself will see on that day, when you go into a hidden inner chamber to hide yourself."
2 Chronicles 18:25 Then the King of Israel commanded, "Take Micaiah and lead him away to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son,
2 Chronicles 18:26 and tell them: 'Thus says the king: Put this man in prison, and feed him with meager rations of bread and water until I return in peace.'"
2 Chronicles 18:27 Micaiah declared, "If you return in peace, then the Lord has not spoken through me." And he added, "Hear, all you peoples!"
2 Chronicles 18:28 So the King of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah, went up to Ramoth-Gilead.
2 Chronicles 18:29 The King of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes." So the King of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.
2 Chronicles 18:30 Now the King of Syria had commanded the commanders of his chariots, saying, "Do not fight against anyone, great or small, except against the King of Israel alone."
2 Chronicles 18:31 When the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, "This must be the King of Israel." So they surrounded him to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out to the Lord, and the Lord helped him; God turned them away from him.
2 Chronicles 18:32 For when the commanders of the chariots realized that he was not the King of Israel, they left him.
2 Chronicles 18:33 However, a certain man drew his bow with careful aim and struck the King of Israel between the joints of his armor, between the lung and the stomach. So Ahab said to his charioteer, "Turn your hand and take me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded."
2 Chronicles 18:34 The battle raged fiercely throughout that day. The King of Israel remained standing in his chariot facing the Syrians until evening. At the setting of the sun, he died.
2 Chronicles 19:1 King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his royal residence in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 19:2 But Jehu, the prophet, son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to him: 'You offer help to the wicked, and you ally yourself with those who hate the Lord. Therefore, you have truly deserved the Lord's wrath.'
2 Chronicles 19:3 However, good deeds have been found in you, because you have removed the Asherah poles (idolatrous altars) from the land of Judah, and you have prepared your heart to seek the Lord, the God of your ancestors.
2 Chronicles 19:4 So Jehoshaphat remained in Jerusalem. Then he again went out among the people, from Beersheba all the way to the hill country of Ephraim, and he brought them back to the Lord, the God of their ancestors.
2 Chronicles 19:5 And he appointed judges in all the fortified cities of Judah, within each individual city.
2 Chronicles 19:6 And he commanded the judges, saying: 'Consider carefully what you do, for you are not exercising judgment for men, but for the Lord; and whatever you judge will redound upon yourselves, meaning you will be held accountable.'
2 Chronicles 19:7 Let the fear of the Lord be with you, and act with caution. For with the Lord our God there is no injustice, nor any partiality for persons, nor a desire for bribes.
2 Chronicles 19:8 Also in Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed Levites, priests, and heads of Israelite families to administer the Lord's justice and judgment for its inhabitants.
2 Chronicles 19:9 And he commanded them, saying: 'Thus you shall act in the fear of the Lord, faithfully and with wholehearted dedication.'
2 Chronicles 19:10 Every case that comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities—whether it is between relatives, or wherever there is a question concerning the divine law, the commandment, the ceremonial practices, or the statutes—you must instruct them so that they do not sin against the Lord. In doing so, wrath will not come upon you and upon your brethren. Therefore, act in this way, and you will not sin.
2 Chronicles 19:11 Moreover, Amariah, your chief priest (or high priest), will preside over all matters pertaining to the Lord's law. Furthermore, Zebadiah, the son of Ishmael, the leader of the house of Judah, will oversee those matters pertaining to the king's duty. You also have the Levites before you to assist. Be strong and act diligently, and the Lord will be with the good (those who do what is right).
2 Chronicles 20:1 After these events, the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon came, and with them people from Midian, to make war against King Jehoshaphat.
2 Chronicles 20:2 Then messengers came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying: “A great multitude of enemies is coming against you from the lands across the Dead Sea, from Syria, and they are now advancing and are already at Engedi.”
2 Chronicles 20:3 But Jehoshaphat was struck with terror by this news, and he gave his whole attention to praying to the Lord; he also proclaimed a fast throughout all of Judah.
2 Chronicles 20:4 So the people of Judah gathered together to pray to the Lord, and people from all the cities of Judah came to ask for His help.
2 Chronicles 20:5 Then King Jehoshaphat stood in the middle of the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the House of the Lord, before the new court,
2 Chronicles 20:6 and he said: “O Lord, God of our fathers, You are God in the heavens, and You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. In Your hand are strength and power, and no one can resist You.
2 Chronicles 20:7 Did You not, O our God, drive out all the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham, Your friend?
2 Chronicles 20:8 And they lived in it and built a sanctuary there for Your Name, saying:
2 Chronicles 20:9 ‘If evil assails us, whether sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine, we will stand before You in this House, where Your Name has been invoked. We will cry out to You in our tribulations, and You will hear us and save us.’
2 Chronicles 20:10 Now behold, the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and Mount Seir—those through whom You did not allow Israel to pass when they came out of Egypt (but they turned away from them and did not destroy them)—
2 Chronicles 20:11 Behold, they are now acting against us and are striving to drive us out of Your possession, which You have given to us.
2 Chronicles 20:12 O our God, will You not judge them? Truly, in us there is not enough strength to resist this great multitude that is rushing upon us. And since we do not know what we should do, this alone remains for us: to direct our eyes to You for help.”
2 Chronicles 20:13 Indeed, all of Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
2 Chronicles 20:14 Therefore, the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite from the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the multitude.
2 Chronicles 20:15 And he said: “Listen, all of Judah, and you who dwell in Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the Lord to you: ‘Do not fear, nor be dismayed by this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God’s.
2 Chronicles 20:16 Tomorrow you will go down against them. For they are coming up by the ascent named Sis, and you will find them at the end of the valley, which is beyond the wilderness of Jeruel.
2 Chronicles 20:17 You will not be the ones to fight. Only stand confidently and you will see the Lord’s help with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not fear, nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, and the Lord will be with you.’”
2 Chronicles 20:18 Then Jehoshaphat, and all Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell prostrate on the ground and worshipped the Lord.
2 Chronicles 20:19 Moreover, the Levites from the sons of the Kohathites and from the sons of Korah rose up to praise the Lord, the God of Israel, with a very loud and high voice.
2 Chronicles 20:20 And when they rose early in the morning, they went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they departed, Jehoshaphat stood and said: “Hear me, Judah, and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be safe. Believe His prophets, and all things will happen prosperously for you.”
2 Chronicles 20:21 And after he took counsel with the people, he appointed singers for the Lord to praise Him in holy vestments. They went out before the army, saying: “Give praise to the Lord, for His mercy endures forever!”
2 Chronicles 20:22 And as they began to sing praises and rejoice, the Lord set ambushes for the sons of Ammon, and Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come out to fight against Judah, and they were defeated.
2 Chronicles 20:23 For the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to kill and utterly destroy them. And when they had finished this work, they also destroyed one another in mutual slaughter.
2 Chronicles 20:24 When the people of Judah came to the watchtower that looks out over the wilderness, they looked from afar and saw the entire region covered with dead bodies, and no one was left alive who could flee.
2 Chronicles 20:25 So Jehoshaphat and all the people with him came to plunder the spoils of the dead. And among the bodies they found clothing, and vessels, and excellent furnishings, and rings, and bracelets, and various ornaments, in such great quantity that they could not carry everything. They spent three days collecting the spoils because of the immense size of the plunder.
2 Chronicles 20:26 On the fourth day, they gathered in the Valley of Beracah (which means 'blessing'), for there they blessed the Lord. And for this reason, it was called the Valley of Blessing even to this present day.
2 Chronicles 20:27 Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned, with Jehoshaphat leading them, back to Jerusalem with great joy, because the Lord had given them joy over their enemies.
2 Chronicles 20:28 And they entered Jerusalem, into the House of the Lord, with psalters, and harps, and trumpets.
2 Chronicles 20:29 Therefore, the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel.
2 Chronicles 20:30 So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat had rest, and his God gave him peace on all sides.
2 Chronicles 20:31 Thus, Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
2 Chronicles 20:32 And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn from it, doing what was good in the sight of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 20:33 Nevertheless, he did not remove the high places for idol worship, and the heart of the people was not yet fully devoted to the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 20:34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, are written in the books of Jehu, the son of Hanani, which are recorded in the books of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles 20:35 After these things, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, allied himself with Ahaziah, king of Israel, whose deeds were very impious.
2 Chronicles 20:36 And he made an agreement with him to build ships that would go to Tarshish; so they built a fleet in Ezion-Geber.
2 Chronicles 20:37 But Eliezer, the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah, appeared prophesying against Jehoshaphat, saying: “Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the Lord has struck down your works and destroyed your ships; so they could not go to Tarshish.”
2 Chronicles 20:38 Therefore, Jehoshaphat died and slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the city of David. Then Jehoram, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 20:39 This verse is a duplicate of verse 34 and confirms the record of Jehoshaphat’s deeds, both early and late, written in the books of Jehu, son of Hanani, which are included in the books of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles 20:40 This verse is a duplicate of verse 31 and re-emphasizes that Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
2 Chronicles 21:1 Josaphat died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. His son Joram then reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 21:2 Joram also had brothers, who were all sons of Josaphat. Their names were Azarias, Jahiel, Zacharias, Azarias, Michael, and Saphatias. All of them were sons of Josaphat, the king of Juda.
2 Chronicles 21:3 Their father had given them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable furnishings. He had also given them fortified cities throughout Juda. But he gave the kingship to Joram, because Joram was his firstborn son.
2 Chronicles 21:4 Therefore, Joram took control of his father's kingdom. Once he had consolidated his power, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and all the leading men of Juda as well.
2 Chronicles 21:5 Joram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 21:6 He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Achab had done, for his wife was the daughter of Achab. And he committed evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 21:7 However, the Lord was unwilling to destroy the house of David because of the covenant He had made with David, and because He had promised to provide a 'lamp'—meaning a continuous line of descendants—for David and his sons for all time.
2 Chronicles 21:8 In those days, Edom rebelled to break free from the dominion of Juda, and they established their own king.
2 Chronicles 21:9 Because of this, Joram set out with his commanders and all the cavalry he possessed. He and his forces rose up by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded them, striking down all the commanders of their cavalry.
2 Chronicles 21:10 Nevertheless, Edom secured its freedom, and has not been subject to Juda down to the present day. At that same time, Libnah also revolted so that it would no longer be under his control, because Joram had abandoned the Lord, the God of his ancestors.
2 Chronicles 21:11 Furthermore, he built high places for idol worship in the cities of Juda, and he led the inhabitants of Jerusalem to spiritual adultery by compelling them to worship idols.
2 Chronicles 21:12 Then a letter came to him from Elias the prophet, which said: 'Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of your father Josaphat, nor in the ways of Asa, the king of Juda,'
2 Chronicles 21:13 'but instead have imitated the kings of Israel and have led Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into spiritual adultery, just as the house of Achab did; and furthermore, you have murdered your own brothers, members of your father’s house, men who were better than you:'
2 Chronicles 21:14 'behold, the Lord will strike you with a mighty plague—and your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions.'
2 Chronicles 21:15 'You yourself will be struck down by a terrible and severe illness of your intestines, until, day by day, your intestines slowly come out of your body.'
2 Chronicles 21:16 Therefore, the Lord stirred up the spirit of hostility against Joram among the Philistines and the Arabs, who dwell near the Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles 21:17 They invaded the land of Juda and plundered it. They carried away all the wealth found in the king's palace, along with his sons and his wives. No son was left to him, except Joachaz, who was his youngest.
2 Chronicles 21:18 After all these things, the Lord struck him with an incurable disease in his intestines.
2 Chronicles 21:19 As days succeeded days, and the passage of time continued, the full cycle of two years was completed. And thus, consumed by a long, wasting sickness, he gave up his spirit. He died from a most terrible illness. And the people did not make a ceremonial burning for him, as was customary for his ancestors.
2 Chronicles 21:20 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. He did not walk in righteousness. And they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
2 Chronicles 22:1 The people of Jerusalem chose Ahaziah, Jehoram’s youngest son, to be the new king in his father’s place. This was because the bandits who had raided the camp along with the Arabians had already killed all of Jehoram's older sons. So Ahaziah, the son of King Jehoram of Judah, began his reign.
2 Chronicles 22:2 Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began his reign, and he reigned for only one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, who was the daughter of Omri.
2 Chronicles 22:3 But Ahaziah himself walked in the sinful ways of the house of Ahab, because his mother encouraged him to behave in an unholy manner.
2 Chronicles 22:4 So he committed evil in the presence of the Lord, just as the house of Ahab had done. Indeed, after his father’s death, Ahab’s family became his counselors, leading him to his own ruin.
2 Chronicles 22:5 He followed their sinful advice and went with Jehoram, the son of Ahab, who was the king of Israel, to fight against Hazael, the king of Syria, at Ramoth-Gilead. There, the Syrians wounded Jehoram.
2 Chronicles 22:6 Jehoram returned to Jezreel to recover from the many wounds he had received in that battle. Ahaziah, the son of King Jehoram of Judah, went down to Jezreel to visit Jehoram, son of Ahab, while he was ill.
2 Chronicles 22:7 It was, in fact, according to God's plan that Ahaziah came to visit Jehoram. After his visit, Ahaziah went out with Jehoram to meet Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to utterly destroy the house of Ahab.
2 Chronicles 22:8 So when Jehu was annihilating the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who served Ahaziah. Jehu then killed all of them.
2 Chronicles 22:9 Jehu pursued Ahaziah and found him hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu, who then killed him. They buried Ahaziah because he was the son of Jehoshaphat, who had truly sought the Lord with all his heart. After this, there was no longer any hope that anyone from Ahaziah’s royal line would be able to reign.
2 Chronicles 22:10 When Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother, saw that her son was dead, she took action. She rose up and mercilessly killed everyone from the royal line of the house of Judah.
2 Chronicles 22:11 Nevertheless, Jehoshabeath, a daughter of the king, took Joash, Ahaziah’s son, and secretly removed him from among the other royal sons who were being killed. She then placed Joash and his nurse in a bedroom to hide them. Jehoshabeath, who was King Jehoram’s daughter, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, and Ahaziah’s own sister, concealed Joash from Athaliah so that he would not be killed.
2 Chronicles 22:12 Joash remained hidden with Jehoshabeath in the Lord’s house for six years. During this time, Athaliah continued to reign over the land.
2 Chronicles 23:1 Later on, in the seventh year, Jehoiada gathered his strength and summoned the captains: namely, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri. And he entered into a solemn covenant with them.
2 Chronicles 23:2 And they went throughout Judah, gathering the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the Israelite families, and they all came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 23:3 And after they had made this covenant, the entire assembly, gathered with the young King Joash in the House of the Lord, heard Jehoiada say to them: 'Behold, the king’s rightful son shall reign, just as the Lord has promised concerning the descendants of David.'
2 Chronicles 23:4 Therefore, this is the plan you shall carry out: A third of you, those who are priests and Levites and gatekeepers, who come in for service on the Sabbath, shall be stationed at the temple gates.
2 Chronicles 23:5 And another third shall be stationed at the king's palace, and the final third at the gate called the Foundation Gate. All the rest of the people, however, shall remain in the courtyards of the House of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 23:6 And no one else shall enter the House of the Lord, except the priests and those Levites who are actively ministering. Only they may enter, because they have been set apart for holy service. All the rest of the people, however, shall observe the Lord's commands by remaining in the outer courts.
2 Chronicles 23:7 And you shall surround the king, each man with his weapons in his hands. If anyone else attempts to enter the inner courts of the temple, let him be put to death. You are to remain with the king, both when he enters and when he leaves.
2 Chronicles 23:8 So the Levites and all of Judah carried out everything that Jehoiada the high priest had commanded. Each man took his designated soldiers—those who were coming on duty for the Sabbath, and those who were going off duty from the Sabbath—for Jehoiada did not dismiss any of the regular priestly divisions.
2 Chronicles 23:9 Jehoiada then gave the captains King David’s spears, large shields, and small shields, which had been consecrated — dedicated to God’s service — and stored in the House of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 23:10 Then he stationed all the people, each girded with a sword, in a line extending from the right side of the temple to the left side of the altar and the temple, encircling the king.
2 Chronicles 23:11 Then they brought out the king's son, Joash, and placed the royal crown upon his head, along with the scroll of the Law, which served as the royal insignia. They then proclaimed him king. Jehoiada and his sons also anointed him with oil, and everyone applauded and shouted, 'Long live the king!'
2 Chronicles 23:12 But Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king. So she went in among the people, into the House of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 23:13 She saw the young king standing on the platform at the entrance to the temple, with the captains and trumpets all around him. All the people of the land were rejoicing, blowing trumpets, singing praises, and playing various musical instruments. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, 'Treason! Treason!'
2 Chronicles 23:14 Then Jehoiada the high priest commanded the captains of the army, saying to them: 'Lead her out beyond the temple enclosure, and let her be put to death there, by the sword.'
2 Chronicles 23:15 For the high priest had given orders that she should not be killed within the sacred confines of the House of the Lord. So they cleared a path for her, and as she left by the Horse Gate, near the path to the king’s palace, they put her to death.
2 Chronicles 23:16 Jehoiada then made a new covenant with all the people and with King Joash, ensuring that they would indeed be the Lord's own people once again.
2 Chronicles 23:17 And all the people then went to the temple of Baal and completely destroyed it. They smashed its altars and idols into pieces. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, right there before his altars.
2 Chronicles 23:18 Jehoiada also appointed supervisors in the House of the Lord, under the authority of the priests and Levites, whom King David had originally assigned to their duties there. Their role was to offer burnt offerings to the Lord, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with joy and songs, according to the musical arrangements established by David.
2 Chronicles 23:19 He also appointed gatekeepers at the entrances to the House of the Lord, to ensure that no one ritually unclean would be permitted to enter.
2 Chronicles 23:20 Jehoiada also assembled the captains, the mighty warriors, the leaders of the people, and all the common folk of the land. They then escorted the king from the House of the Lord and brought him through the Upper Gate into the royal palace, where they seated him securely upon the royal throne.
2 Chronicles 23:21 All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city settled into peace, now that Athaliah had been put to death by the sword.
2 Chronicles 24:1 Joash was seven years old when he began his reign. He reigned for forty years in Jerusalem, the city of peace. His mother’s name was Sebia, from the city of Beersheba.
2 Chronicles 24:2 And he did what was pleasing and right before the Lord God for as long as Jehoiada the priest lived.
2 Chronicles 24:3 Jehoiada took two wives for King Joash, and from them, Joash begot sons and daughters.
2 Chronicles 24:4 After these events, Joash began to consider how to restore the Temple of the Lord God.
2 Chronicles 24:5 So King Joash gathered the priests and Levites and told them: "Go throughout the cities of Judah and collect money from all the people of Israel. This money is to repair the Temple of your God each year. Make haste and complete this task." However, the Levites completely neglected their duty.
2 Chronicles 24:6 Then the king summoned Jehoiada, the high priest, and said to him: "Why have you failed to compel the Levites to collect the money that was brought from Judah and Jerusalem for the Temple, which houses the Ark of the Covenant?"
2 Chronicles 24:7 For Athaliah, who was a wicked woman, along with her sons, had destroyed the Temple of God. They had even taken all the sacred vessels and consecrated articles from the Lord's Temple and used them to worship the false gods, Baalim.
2 Chronicles 24:8 Therefore, the king gave a command, and they made a chest. They placed this chest outside, next to the entrance gate of the Lord's Temple.
2 Chronicles 24:9 And it was proclaimed throughout Judah and Jerusalem that everyone should bring to the Lord the temple tax, which Moses, the servant of God, had levied upon all Israel in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles 24:10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced. They offered gifts and put them into the chest of the Lord until it was filled.
2 Chronicles 24:11 And whenever it was time for the Levites' officials to bring the chest before the king (for they saw that much money had been collected), the king’s scribe would come, along with the official appointed by the chief priest. They would empty the money that was in the chest, and then return the chest to its proper place. They did this regularly, day after day, and a large sum of money was gathered.
2 Chronicles 24:12 The king and Jehoiada then gave this money to those who were in charge of the work on the Lord's Temple. These overseers used the money to hire masons and carpenters to restore the Temple. They also hired ironworkers and bronzesmiths to repair whatever had fallen into ruin.
2 Chronicles 24:13 And those who were in charge of the work did so. The damage to the structure was covered over, and they restored the Temple of the Lord to its proper state and made it strong.
2 Chronicles 24:14 When the work on the Temple was completed, they brought the remaining money before the king and Jehoiada. From this money, they made vessels for use in the Lord’s Temple: tables, bowls, small mortars, and other vessels of gold and silver. And throughout all the days that Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were continually offered in the Lord’s Temple.
2 Chronicles 24:15 Therefore, Jehoiada grew old and lived a long life, full of days. He died when he was one hundred and thirty years old.
2 Chronicles 24:16 They buried him in the City of David, among the kings, because he had done much good for Israel, both for the nation and for the household of God.
2 Chronicles 24:17 But after Jehoiada died, the princes of Judah approached King Joash and bowed down before him, showing him homage. The king, swayed by their entreaties, agreed to their requests.
2 Chronicles 24:18 And so, they abandoned the Temple of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, and instead served sacred groves and carved idols. Because of this grievous sin, great wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 24:19 God continually sent prophets to them to bring them back to the Lord, but even with their solemn warnings, the people refused to listen to anything.
2 Chronicles 24:20 Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and declared to them: "Thus says the Lord God: 'Why do you transgress the commandment of the Lord? This will bring you no good. You have forsaken the Lord, and therefore He has forsaken you.'"
2 Chronicles 24:21 But the people conspired against him and, at the king's command, stoned him to death in the courtyard of the Lord's Temple.
2 Chronicles 24:22 King Joash did not remember the great kindness that Jehoiada, his father and mentor, had shown him, but instead had Jehoiada's son killed. As Zechariah lay dying, he cried out: "May the Lord see this injustice, and may He hold you accountable!"
2 Chronicles 24:23 And when a year had passed, the army of Syria marched against King Joash. They invaded Judah and Jerusalem, killing all the leaders of the people and sending all the plunder they had taken back to the king in Damascus.
2 Chronicles 24:24 Indeed, even though the Syrian army came with only a small number of soldiers, the Lord delivered a vast multitude of Judah's people into their hands. This was because Judah had abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors. And upon King Joash himself, a very severe judgment was executed.
2 Chronicles 24:25 When the Syrians withdrew, they left Joash afflicted with many painful diseases. Then his own servants rose up against him to avenge the shedding of the blood of Jehoiada the priest's son. They murdered him on his own bed, and so he died. They buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the royal tombs alongside the other kings.
2 Chronicles 24:26 Those who conspired against him were Zabad, the son of Shimeath, an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, a Moabitess.
2 Chronicles 24:27 Furthermore, the details of his sons, the amount of money that had been collected during his reign, and the full account of the restoration of the Temple of God are all diligently recorded in the Book of the Kings. And his son Amaziah succeeded him as king.
2 Chronicles 25:1 Amasias was twenty-five years old when he began his reign. He reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Joadan, and she was from Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 25:2 He did what was good in the sight of the Lord, but his heart was not fully committed to God; his faithfulness was flawed.
2 Chronicles 25:3 When his reign was firmly established, he executed the servants who had murdered King Joas, his father.
2 Chronicles 25:4 However, he did not put their children to death. This was in accordance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the Lord had commanded, saying: "Parents shall not die for their children, nor children for their parents, but each person shall die for their own sin."
2 Chronicles 25:5 Amasias also gathered Judah and appointed military commanders for them, according to their families, placing tribunes and centurions throughout all Judah and Benjamin. He counted all men twenty years and older and found thirty thousand young men who were able to go out to battle and were skilled with weapons.
2 Chronicles 25:6 He also hired one hundred thousand strong warriors from Israel for one hundred talents of silver. This was a mercenary army.
2 Chronicles 25:7 But a man of God, a prophet, came to him and said: "O King, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the Lord is not with Israel, nor with all the sons of Ephraim." The Lord had rejected their alliance.
2 Chronicles 25:8 "If you think that your army will be strengthened by these mercenaries, then act boldly and be strong in battle. But the Lord will still cause you to be defeated before your enemies, because it is God who can both help and cause flight."
2 Chronicles 25:9 Amasias then said to the man of God: "What shall then become of the hundred talents of silver that I have given to the soldiers of Israel?" To which the man of God answered: "The Lord has the means to give you much more than this."
2 Chronicles 25:10 So Amasias separated the army that had come to him from Ephraim, sending them back to their own region. But they were extremely angry at Judah and returned to their own lands, full of rage.
2 Chronicles 25:11 Amasias, strengthened by God's counsel, led his people out and went to the Valley of Salt, where he struck down ten thousand of the sons of Seir, the Idumeans.
2 Chronicles 25:12 And the sons of Judah captured ten thousand others alive. They brought them to the top of a certain craggy rock and threw them down from it, so that all of them were broken into pieces. This was a brutal act of war.
2 Chronicles 25:13 Meanwhile, the mercenary army that Amasias had sent back, refusing to let them go with him to battle, spread themselves over the cities of Judah, from Samaria all the way to Bethoron. They killed three thousand people and plundered a great deal of spoil.
2 Chronicles 25:14 After Amasias returned from the slaughter of the Idumeans, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, the defeated people, and set them up as his own gods. He worshipped these false gods and offered libations to them.
2 Chronicles 25:15 And the Lord was angry against Amasias. He sent a prophet to him, who said: "Why have you sought the gods of these foreign peoples, who could not even deliver their own people from your hand, let alone help you?"
2 Chronicles 25:16 As the prophet spoke these words, Amasias answered him: "Are you the king's counselor? Be silent, lest I have you killed!" So the prophet stopped, but he added: "I know that the Lord has decided to destroy you, because you have done this evil by worshipping idols and have no longer listened to my word."
2 Chronicles 25:17 Therefore, Amasias, king of Judah, after taking counsel with his officials, sent messengers to Joas, son of Joachaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: "Come, let us meet face to face in battle."
2 Chronicles 25:18 Joas sent messengers in return, saying: "The thistle of Lebanon sent to the cedar of Lebanon, saying: 'Give your daughter to my son as a wife.' But then the wild beasts of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle." This was a parable, mocking Amasias.
2 Chronicles 25:19 "You have said: 'I have indeed defeated Idumea,' and because of this, your heart is lifted up in pride. Stay in your own home! Why do you provoke evil, that you should fall, you and Judah with you?" This was a direct warning against Amasias's arrogance.
2 Chronicles 25:20 But Amasias would not listen, because it was God's plan and judgment that he should be handed over into the hands of his enemies, because of his worship of the gods of Idumea.
2 Chronicles 25:21 So Joas, king of Israel, went up against Judah. And they met face to face, he and Amasias, king of Judah, at Bethsames, which is in Judah.
2 Chronicles 25:22 And Judah was defeated before Israel. Every man fled to his own tent, abandoning their king.
2 Chronicles 25:23 Furthermore, Joas, king of Israel, captured Amasias, king of Judah, the son of Joas, son of Joachaz, at Bethsames. He brought him to Jerusalem and then broke down the walls of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, from the Ephraim Gate all the way to the Corner Gate.
2 Chronicles 25:24 He also took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that he found in the house of God, and with Obededom, and in the king's treasuries. He also took hostages, the sons of the nobles, and brought them back to Samaria.
2 Chronicles 25:25 Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joas, the son of Joachaz, king of Israel.
2 Chronicles 25:26 The rest of the acts of Amasias, both his early deeds and his later ones, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 25:27 However, after Amasias turned away from following the Lord, a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachis. They sent men after him to Lachis and murdered him there.
2 Chronicles 25:28 And they brought him back on horses and buried him in the city of David, Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 26:1 Therefore, all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
2 Chronicles 26:2 He built Ailath and restored it for Judah, after King Amaziah had died and been buried with his ancestors.
2 Chronicles 26:3 Azariah was sixteen years old when he began his reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jechelia, and she was from Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 26:4 He did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done.
2 Chronicles 26:5 He sought the Lord's guidance during the time of Zechariah the prophet, who taught him to fear the Lord. And as long as he sought the Lord, God made him prosper in all his endeavors.
2 Chronicles 26:6 It was he who waged war against the Philistines and tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. He also built new towns in the region of Ashdod and throughout the land of the Philistines.
2 Chronicles 26:7 And God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs who lived in Gur-Baal, and against the Ammonites.
2 Chronicles 26:8 The Ammonites brought gifts and tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread even to the border of Egypt, because of his many victories and his growing power.
2 Chronicles 26:9 Uzziah also built defensive towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and fortified them strongly.
2 Chronicles 26:10 He also built watchtowers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns for water, because he had large flocks and herds. He employed farmers in the plains and lowlands for his fields and vineyards, and vine-growers in the hill country and on Mount Carmel, for he was a great lover of agriculture.
2 Chronicles 26:11 Uzziah also maintained a strong army of trained soldiers, numbering three hundred and seven thousand five hundred men, who were always ready for battle.
2 Chronicles 26:12 All of these were under the command of two thousand six hundred valiant officers, each leading units from their own family clans.
2 Chronicles 26:13 And under the command of these officers was the main army of fighters, totaling three hundred and seven thousand five hundred soldiers, who fought for the king against his enemies.
2 Chronicles 26:14 Uzziah also equipped his entire army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows and arrows, and slings for casting stones.
2 Chronicles 26:15 In Jerusalem, he invented and built various types of ingenious war machines to be placed on the towers and at the corners of the walls. These machines could shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His fame spread far and wide because he was miraculously helped by God until he became powerful.
2 Chronicles 26:16 But when he had become strong, his heart became proud, leading to his ruin. He then disregarded the Lord his God and entered the Lord’s Temple to burn incense on the altar of incense, which was forbidden to him.
2 Chronicles 26:17 Then Azariah the high priest boldly went in after him, followed by eighty courageous priests of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 26:18 They confronted Uzziah and said to him: “It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord! That is the duty of the priests alone—the descendants of Aaron—who have been consecrated for this sacred ministry. Leave the sanctuary at once! Do not defy God's command! For this act will bring you no honor from the Lord God, but rather His judgment.”
2 Chronicles 26:19 Uzziah, still holding the censer in his hand, became furious with the priests, intending to burn the incense regardless. But at that very moment, leprosy broke out on his forehead right there in the presence of the priests, inside the Lord's Temple, beside the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles 26:20 When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests turned to look at him, they saw the leprosy on his forehead and immediately rushed him out of the Temple. He himself also hurried out, for he knew that the Lord had afflicted him with the disease.
2 Chronicles 26:21 King Uzziah remained a leper until the day of his death. He lived in a separate house, isolated because of his leprosy. Because of this, he was also barred from entering the Lord's Temple. Meanwhile, his son Jotham took charge of the royal palace, governing the people of the land.
2 Chronicles 26:22 The rest of the events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, were recorded by the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.
2 Chronicles 26:23 Uzziah died and was buried with his ancestors, but they buried him in a royal field, not in the royal tombs, because he had been a leper. And his son Jotham reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 27:1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began his reign as king, and he ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha, daughter of Zadok.
2 Chronicles 27:2 He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Uzziah had done in all things, except that he did not enter the Temple of the Lord—a transgression his father had made—and the people still continued to sin against God.
2 Chronicles 27:3 It was Jotham who built the upper gate of the Temple of the Lord, and he also constructed much on the wall of Ophel, a fortified section of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 27:4 He built cities in the mountains of Judah, and he also constructed fortresses and towers in the forests.
2 Chronicles 27:5 He himself fought against the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. In that time, the Ammonites paid him one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand kors of barley as tribute.
2 Chronicles 27:6 The Ammonites continued to pay these same amounts to King Jotham in the second year and the third year of his reign.
2 Chronicles 27:7 Jotham grew strong in his reign, because he had directed his ways steadfastly before the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles 27:8 The rest of the acts of Jotham—including all his wars and his other deeds—are written in the book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles 27:9 Jotham was forty-one years old when he began his reign, and he ruled for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He slept with his fathers—that is, he died—and they buried him in the City of David. His son Ahaz then reigned as king in his place.
2 Chronicles 28:1 Ahaz was twelve years old when he began to reign. He reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, but he did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God, unlike David his forefather.
2 Chronicles 28:2 Instead, he walked in the wicked ways of the kings of Israel, even casting molten idols for the false gods known as Baalim.
2 Chronicles 28:3 For he himself burned incense in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom. He even burned his own sons alive in fire, following the abominable practices of the pagan nations that the Lord had driven out before the sons of Israel.
2 Chronicles 28:4 He also offered sacrifices and burned incense on the pagan high places, on the hills, and under every leafy tree—places dedicated to idolatry.
2 Chronicles 28:5 Therefore, the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria, who struck him down and carried away a great number of captives from Judah to Damascus. The Lord also delivered Ahaz—the king of Judah—into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted a great slaughter upon Judah.
2 Chronicles 28:6 Azarias, son of Remaliah—the king of Israel—killed one hundred and twenty thousand men from Judah in a single day. All of them were mighty warriors, and this happened because they had forsaken the Lord, the God of their forefathers.
2 Chronicles 28:7 At that same time, Zichri, a powerful warrior from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the chief officer of the royal palace, and Elkanah, who was second in authority to the king.
2 Chronicles 28:8 The sons of Israel also took captive from their brethren in Judah two hundred thousand women, boys, and girls. They also took a vast amount of plunder and brought it all to Samaria.
2 Chronicles 28:9 Now there was a prophet of the Lord there, whose name was Oded. He went out to meet the army returning to Samaria and said to them: 'Listen! The Lord God of your forefathers was indeed angry with Judah and delivered them into your hands. But you have killed them with such cruel savagery that your cruelty has reached up to heaven itself, provoking divine wrath!'
2 Chronicles 28:10 Furthermore, you now intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem to yourselves as male and female slaves. This is absolutely not right for you to do! Have you yourselves not also sinned against the Lord your God?
2 Chronicles 28:11 Now, therefore, listen to my advice: return the captives whom you have taken from your brethren. Otherwise, the fierce wrath of the Lord will surely return upon you.
2 Chronicles 28:12 Then, certain men from among the chiefs of Ephraim—namely Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—stood up to confront those who were returning from the war.
2 Chronicles 28:13 And they said to them: 'Do not bring the captives here, lest we add to our sin against the Lord! Do you wish to pile even more onto our already existing sins and ancient offenses? Indeed, our sin is already great, and the fierce wrath of the Lord is already upon Israel!'
2 Chronicles 28:14 So the army released the captives and all the plunder in the presence of the princes and the entire assembly of people.
2 Chronicles 28:15 Then the men whom we mentioned previously stepped forward. They took the captives, and all those who were naked, and clothed them with garments from the plunder. After they had clothed, shod, refreshed them with food and drink, and anointed them with oil, they then transported them by chariots to their brethren in Jericho, the City of Palms. Afterward, these men returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles 28:16 At that same time, King Ahaz sent an urgent plea to the king of Assyria, requesting military assistance.
2 Chronicles 28:17 For the Edomites had also invaded Judah, struck down many people, and carried away much plunder.
2 Chronicles 28:18 The Philistines also spread throughout the lowland cities and the southern region of Judah. They captured Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo, along with their surrounding villages, and then settled there.
2 Chronicles 28:19 For the Lord had brought Judah low because of Ahaz, the king of Judah. This was because Ahaz had stripped Judah of divine help and had contemptuously rebelled against the Lord.
2 Chronicles 28:20 Then Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria, came against Ahaz. He not only afflicted Ahaz but also utterly devastated the land of Judah without any resistance.
2 Chronicles 28:21 Ahaz, indeed, stripped the house of the Lord, as well as the royal palace and the houses of the princes, and gave these treasures as gifts to the king of Assyria. Yet, despite all this, it brought him no benefit.
2 Chronicles 28:22 Moreover, even in the very time of his distress and suffering, King Ahaz only increased the sins he had previously committed against the Lord.
2 Chronicles 28:23 Then Ahaz sacrificed victims to the gods of Damascus, claiming that these were the gods who had defeated him. And he said, 'The gods of the kings of Syria help them in battle, so I will worship them, and perhaps they will give me help.' Yet, on the contrary, these very gods became the ruin of Ahaz and of all Israel.
2 Chronicles 28:24 So Ahaz gathered all the sacred vessels from the house of God and cut them into pieces. He then shut the doors of the house of the Lord and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 28:25 Furthermore, in all the cities of Judah, he built high places for burning incense to pagan deities. In doing so, he provoked the Lord, the God of his forefathers, to great anger.
2 Chronicles 28:26 Now, the rest of the acts of Ahaz, and all his works, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 28:27 So Ahaz slept with his forefathers, and they buried him in the city of Jerusalem. However, they did not place him in the royal tombs of the kings of Israel—meaning the ancestral burial grounds of Judah's kings—because of his wickedness. And his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 29:1 Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king. He reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Chronicles 29:2 And he did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, just as David his father had done.
2 Chronicles 29:3 In the first year of his reign, in the very first month, he opened the doors of the House of the Lord and restored them.
2 Chronicles 29:4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, gathering them together in the eastern square.
2 Chronicles 29:5 And he said to them, 'Listen to me, Levites! Sanctify yourselves and purify the House of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and remove all defilement from the sanctuary'.
2 Chronicles 29:6 For our fathers have sinned greatly and done evil in the sight of the Lord our God. They abandoned Him, turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the Lord, and turned their backs to it.
2 Chronicles 29:7 They also shut the doors of the portico, extinguished the lamps, did not burn incense, and did not offer burnt offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 29:8 Therefore, the Lord's wrath was kindled against Judah and Jerusalem, and He delivered them into turmoil, into astonishment, and into a curse that makes people hiss in contempt, just as you yourselves see with your own eyes.
2 Chronicles 29:9 Behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons, our daughters, and our wives have been led away captive because of this.
2 Chronicles 29:10 Now, therefore, it is my firm intention to make a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel, so that the fierce anger of His wrath may turn away from us.
2 Chronicles 29:11 My sons, do not be negligent! The Lord has chosen you to stand before Him, to minister to Him, to serve Him, and to burn incense.
2 Chronicles 29:12 So the Levites rose up: Maath, son of Amasai, and Joel, son of Azariah, from the sons of Kohath. From the sons of Merari, Kish, son of Abdi, and Azariah, son of Jehalelel. And from the sons of Gershon, Joah, son of Zimmah, and Eden, son of Joah.
2 Chronicles 29:13 From the sons of Elizaphan: Nechahi and Oziel. And from the sons of Asaph: Samri and Jeiel.
2 Chronicles 29:14 From the sons of Heman: Zechariah and Mattaniah. From the sons of Jeduthun: Jehiel and Shimei.
2 Chronicles 29:15 After gathering their brethren and sanctifying themselves, they went in, according to the king's command and the Lord's precept, to purify the House of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 29:16 The priests then entered the Lord's Temple to purify it and brought out all the defilement they found there into the vestibule of the Lord's House. After that, they went out with the Levites and carried it outside to the Kidron Valley.
2 Chronicles 29:17 They began to sanctify the Temple on the first day of the first month. On the eighth day of that month, they entered the portico of the Temple. They purified the Temple itself for eight days, and on the sixteenth day of that same month, they completed the purification of the Lord's House.
2 Chronicles 29:18 They also went in to King Hezekiah, saying, 'We have purified all the sacred parts of the Lord's House, the altar of burnt offering, and all its vessels, as well as the table of the bread of the Presence with all its vessels'.
2 Chronicles 29:19 And all the vessels that King Ahaz, during his reign, had polluted when he scorned the law of the Lord—all these we have purified and sanctified, and they are now before the altar of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 29:20 Then King Hezekiah rose early in the morning and, gathering all the leaders of the city, went up to the House of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 29:21 And he offered seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. He also commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 29:22 So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and poured it upon the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and also poured that blood upon the altar. And they sacrificed the lambs and, in the same way, poured their blood upon the altar.
2 Chronicles 29:23 They brought the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the entire assembly, who laid their hands upon them.
2 Chronicles 29:24 Then the priests laid their hands upon them and sprinkled their blood on the altar for the atonement of all Israel; for the king had commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all of Israel.
2 Chronicles 29:25 He also stationed the Levites in the House of the Lord with cymbals, psalteries, and lyres, according to the ordinance of King David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet—for it was the Lord's command given through His prophets.
2 Chronicles 29:26 So the Levites stood with the musical instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
2 Chronicles 29:27 And Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of the Lord began simultaneously, along with the trumpets and the various instruments that had been made under King David's direction, by the hands of the Levite ministers.
2 Chronicles 29:28 And the entire assembly worshipped, with the singers and trumpets sounding in unison, until the burnt offering was completed.
2 Chronicles 29:29 And when the offering was finished, the king and all who were with him bowed down and worshipped.
2 Chronicles 29:30 Then King Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph, the king's seer. And they praised Him with great joy, bowing their heads in worship.
2 Chronicles 29:31 And Hezekiah spoke further, saying, 'Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, approach and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the House of the Lord.' So the entire assembly brought sacrifices, thank offerings, and burnt offerings with a devout heart.
2 Chronicles 29:32 The number of burnt offerings that the assembly brought was this: seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs.
2 Chronicles 29:33 They also consecrated to the Lord six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles 29:34 However, the priests were too few in number and could not suffice to flay all the skins of the burnt offerings. Therefore, their brethren the Levites helped them until the work was completed and other priests could sanctify themselves. For the Levites were more diligent and more willing to purify themselves than the priests.
2 Chronicles 29:35 For there were many burnt offerings, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus, the ceremonies of the House of the Lord were restored.
2 Chronicles 29:36 And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because the service of the Lord's House had been completely restored, for the matter had been accomplished so swiftly.
2 Chronicles 29:37 And Hezekiah rose up, and all the people who were with him, and went to the House of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 29:38 And Hezekiah commanded them to offer burnt offerings upon the altar, and to sacrifice peace offerings.
2 Chronicles 29:39 And the people offered sacrifices and peace offerings, and all who willingly offered burnt offerings to the Lord.
2 Chronicles 29:40 And in one day, the people offered one hundred seventy thousand burnt offerings.
2 Chronicles 30:1 King Hezekiah sent messengers to all the tribes of Israel and Judah, and he also sent letters to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. The purpose was to invite everyone to come to the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 30:2 For the king and his officials, along with the entire assembly in Jerusalem, had decided and agreed to celebrate the Passover in the second month.
2 Chronicles 30:3 They could not celebrate the Passover at its usual, appointed time because only a few priests had completed the necessary purification rituals for themselves, and the people had not yet gathered in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 30:4 This decision was pleasing to the king and to the whole multitude of the people.
2 Chronicles 30:5 So they issued a decree to proclaim throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba in the south to Dan in the north, that everyone should come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the Lord, the God of Israel. Many people had not celebrated it according to the law as it was written.
2 Chronicles 30:6 So the runners went out with letters from the king and his officials throughout all Israel and Judah, as the king had commanded. They proclaimed: "Children of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. Then He will turn back to the remnant of you who have escaped the hand of the king of Assyria."
2 Chronicles 30:7 "Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who turned away from the Lord, the God of their fathers. He delivered them to destruction, as you yourselves can plainly see."
2 Chronicles 30:8 "Do not be stubborn, as your fathers were. Submit yourselves to the Lord and come to His sanctuary, which He has sanctified for all time. Serve the Lord your God, so that the fierce anger of God may be removed from you."
2 Chronicles 30:9 "For if you return to the Lord, your brothers and your children will find mercy before their captors, who led them away as prisoners, and they will return to this land. For the Lord your God is gracious and merciful. He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him."
2 Chronicles 30:10 So the runners traveled from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the way to Zebulun. However, the people there mocked and ridiculed them.
2 Chronicles 30:11 Nevertheless, some people from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbling themselves and accepted the invitation, came to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 30:12 In Judah also, the hand of the Lord was at work, giving them one heart and mind to obey the command of the king and the officials, according to the word of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 30:13 Consequently, many people gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month. It was an exceedingly large assembly.
2 Chronicles 30:14 Then they rose up and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars where incense was burned to idols. They threw everything they tore down into the Kidron Valley.
2 Chronicles 30:15 They sacrificed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites, feeling ashamed for their prior neglect, purified themselves and brought burnt offerings into the Temple of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 30:16 They stood in their assigned places according to the arrangement and the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests received the blood from the hands of the Levites.
2 Chronicles 30:17 This was because a great many of the assembled people had not purified themselves properly. Therefore, the Levites sacrificed the Passover lambs on behalf of all those who were not purified, in order to consecrate them to the Lord.
2 Chronicles 30:18 Indeed, a large part of the people—many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun—had not been purified, yet they ate the Passover meal in a way that was not according to what was written in the law. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the good Lord show mercy to everyone,
2 Chronicles 30:19 who sincerely seeks the Lord, the God of their fathers, even if they have not observed the strict purification requirements. May He not hold it against them that they are less than perfectly purified."
2 Chronicles 30:20 And the Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people, forgiving their impurity and allowing them to participate fully.
2 Chronicles 30:21 So the children of Israel who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. They praised the Lord every single day, with the Levites and priests playing musical instruments that were appropriate for their sacred art.
2 Chronicles 30:22 Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who demonstrated good understanding in matters pertaining to the Lord. And for seven days, they ate the festival meals, offering peace offerings and confessing their sins and praising the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 30:23 Then it pleased the entire assembly to celebrate for another seven days, and they did so with immense joy.
2 Chronicles 30:24 King Hezekiah of Judah provided the assembly with a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep. The princes, for their part, contributed a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. Thus, a very large number of priests were purified and ready for service.
2 Chronicles 30:25 And the entire assembly of Judah rejoiced—both the priests and the Levites, and all the multitude who had come from Israel. Even the foreigners, who had come from the land of Israel and from foreign lands, joined in the celebration.
2 Chronicles 30:26 There was a great celebration in Jerusalem. Indeed, since the time of Solomon, son of David, had reigned in Jerusalem, nothing like this had happened in Israel.
2 Chronicles 30:27 Then the priests and the Levites stood up and blessed the people. Their voice was heard in God’s holy sky, and their prayer reached His holy dwelling place.
2 Chronicles 31:1 After King Hezekiah had properly celebrated these holy festivals, all the people of Israel who were present in the cities of Judah then went out. They broke the pagan idols, cut down the Asherah poles—which were false shrines to goddesses—tore down all the high places of false worship, and destroyed all the pagan altars throughout the territories of Judah and Benjamin. They even went into the northern territories of Ephraim and Manasseh, tearing down everything until all remnants of false worship were completely destroyed. After this, all the people of Israel returned to their own towns and homes.
2 Chronicles 31:2 King Hezekiah then organized the priests and Levites into their appointed divisions. Each of them was assigned to their specific duty, whether priest or Levite, for offering burnt sacrifices and peace offerings, to serve and give thanks, and to sing praises at the entrances of the Lord's encampment—referring to the temple.
2 Chronicles 31:3 The king also provided a portion from his own wealth for the burnt sacrifices, specifically for the morning and evening offerings, and for the burnt sacrifices on Sabbaths, New Moons, and other festival days, just as it is written in the Law of Moses.
2 Chronicles 31:4 He also commanded the people living in Jerusalem to give the assigned portions to the priests and Levites, so that they could dedicate themselves fully to the Law of the Lord without distraction.
2 Chronicles 31:5 As soon as this command reached the hearts of all the people, the Israelites brought an abundance of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and every kind of produce from their fields. They brought in a full tenth of everything as offerings.
2 Chronicles 31:6 Also, the people of Israel and Judah who lived in the cities of Judah brought a tenth of their cattle and sheep. They also brought a tenth of all the holy offerings they had consecrated to the Lord their God. They piled these offerings up in many heaps.
2 Chronicles 31:7 They began laying the foundations of these offering piles in the third month, which is around May/June, and they finished by the seventh month, around September/October.
2 Chronicles 31:8 When King Hezekiah and his officials came and saw these large piles of offerings, they blessed the Lord and His people, Israel.
2 Chronicles 31:9 King Hezekiah then asked the priests and Levites why there were so many of these piles of offerings.
2 Chronicles 31:10 Azariah, the chief priest from the lineage of Zadok, replied to him, saying: "Ever since the people began to bring their offerings into the Lord's Temple, we priests have eaten and been fully satisfied. There is still a great abundance left over, because the Lord has blessed His people, and these piles you see are what remains."
2 Chronicles 31:11 Then King Hezekiah commanded them to prepare storerooms within the Lord's Temple. When they had done this,
2 Chronicles 31:12 they faithfully brought in the first fruits, the tithes, and all the consecrated offerings into these storerooms. Coneniah, a Levite, was appointed in charge of these provisions, with his brother Shimei as his assistant.
2 Chronicles 31:13 Under the authority of Coneniah and his brother Shimei, and by the command of King Hezekiah and Azariah, the chief officer of the Lord's Temple, the following men were appointed as overseers: Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah.
2 Chronicles 31:14 Kore, the son of Imnah, a Levite who was the doorkeeper of the eastern gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings made to the Lord. It was his duty to distribute the consecrated first fruits and all the dedicated offerings.
2 Chronicles 31:15 Under Kore's authority, Eden, Benjamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah faithfully distributed portions to their priestly brothers in their respective cities, giving each person their due share, regardless of age.
2 Chronicles 31:16 This distribution was for every male from three years old and up, for all who came into the Lord's Temple for service, and for those among their own people who performed their daily duties, according to their assigned shifts and responsibilities.
2 Chronicles 31:17 The priests also received their portions according to their family lines and households, and the Levites received theirs from twenty years old and up, according to their assigned duties and divisions.
2 Chronicles 31:18 The portions were distributed to all their children—both young and old—their wives, sons, and daughters, and the entire assembly, because all these people faithfully dedicated themselves to the sacred services of the holy Temple.
2 Chronicles 31:19 Furthermore, in every city throughout all of Judah, priests residing in the surrounding fields and pasturelands divided portions to every male descendant of the priestly lineage and to the Levites.
2 Chronicles 31:20 So King Hezekiah did all these things we have described throughout Judah. He did what was good, upright, and true in the sight of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles 31:21 In every work he undertook concerning the service of the Lord's Temple, and regarding the Law and the Commandments, he sought his God with his whole heart, and he prospered greatly.
2 Chronicles 32:1 After King Hezekiah had faithfully carried out these reforms and delivered these words of truth and encouragement to the people, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, invaded the land of Judah. He laid siege to its fortified cities, intending to conquer them all.
2 Chronicles 32:2 When King Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had indeed invaded and that the entire force of the Assyrian war effort was now directed against Jerusalem:
2 Chronicles 32:3 Hezekiah consulted with his officials and his most capable leaders. Together, they decided to block up the water sources that were outside the city walls. With everyone agreeing to the plan, they proceeded to cover them.
2 Chronicles 32:4 A large number of people gathered together, and they blocked up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the middle of the land. They said, 'The kings of Assyria must not come here and find an abundance of water for themselves.'
2 Chronicles 32:5 Hezekiah then strengthened the city's defenses. He rebuilt all the parts of the wall that had been broken down and added towers upon it. He also constructed another wall outside the existing one, and fortified the Millo, a stronghold in the City of David. Furthermore, he had weapons of every kind made, along with many shields.
2 Chronicles 32:6 He appointed military commanders over the people. Then, gathering all the armed men, and with everyone swearing an oath of loyalty, he spoke to them:
2 Chronicles 32:7 'Be strong and act courageously! Do not be afraid, and do not be dismayed by the king of Assyria or by the vast army that is with him. For there are far more with us than there are with him!'
2 Chronicles 32:8 'With the king of Assyria is only the strength of mortal men, but with us is the Lord our God, who is powerful and will fight on our behalf!' And the people were greatly encouraged by the words of Hezekiah, the king of Judah.
2 Chronicles 32:9 After these events, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his officials to Jerusalem. (Sennacherib himself, with his entire army, was then besieging the city of Lachish). He sent them to King Hezekiah of Judah and to all the people who were in Jerusalem, with this message:
2 Chronicles 32:10 'This is what Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, says: In what do you place your trust, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?'
2 Chronicles 32:11 'Does not Hezekiah mislead you, to deliver you over to the suffering of hunger and thirst, when he claims: The Lord our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?'
2 Chronicles 32:12 'Is this not the same Hezekiah who destroyed the high places of worship and the altars, commanding Judah and Jerusalem, saying: You shall worship before only one altar, and upon it alone you shall burn incense?' —Sennacherib here misunderstands Hezekiah's reforms, which were against pagan idolatry, not true worship of God.
2 Chronicles 32:13 'Are you unaware of what I and my predecessors have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of the various nations been able to deliver their lands from my hand?'
2 Chronicles 32:14 'Who among all the gods of the nations, which my predecessors and I have utterly destroyed, has been able to rescue his people from my hand, that your God should be able to rescue you from this hand of mine?'
2 Chronicles 32:15 'Therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you, nor let him mislead you with such trivial persuasion! Do not believe him! If no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand and from the hand of my predecessors, then much less will your God be able to rescue you from my hand!'
2 Chronicles 32:16 Furthermore, Sennacherib's officials spoke many other blasphemous words against the Lord God and against His servant Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles 32:17 He also wrote letters filled with blasphemy against the Lord God of Israel. He spoke against God as if He were merely one of the gods of the other nations of the earth—gods made by the hands of men.
2 Chronicles 32:18 Then his officials shouted loudly in the Hebrew language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall. They did this to frighten them and cause them to surrender the city.
2 Chronicles 32:19 They spoke of the God of Jerusalem just as they had spoken of the gods of the other peoples of the earth, saying they were merely the work of human hands.
2 Chronicles 32:20 But King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed against this situation. They cried out to God in the universe.
2 Chronicles 32:21 So the Lord sent an angel, who eliminated all the strong, valiant warriors, and the commanders, and the officers of the army of the king of Assyria. Sennacherib then returned to his own land in utter shame. And when he entered the temple of his god, his own sons, who had come from his body, killed him there with the sword.
2 Chronicles 32:22 Thus, the Lord saved King Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all their other enemies. He granted them peace on every side.
2 Chronicles 32:23 Many people also brought gifts to the Lord in Jerusalem, and valuable presents to King Hezekiah of Judah. After these events, Hezekiah was exalted in the eyes of all the nations.
2 Chronicles 32:24 In those days, Hezekiah became ill and was close to death. He prayed to the Lord, and the Lord heard him and gave him a sign.
2 Chronicles 32:25 However, Hezekiah did not return thanks according to the benefits he had received from God. Instead, his heart became proud, and the Lord's wrath came upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 32:26 Yet, Hezekiah humbled himself because of the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Therefore, the Lord's wrath did not come upon them during Hezekiah's lifetime.
2 Chronicles 32:27 Hezekiah also amassed countless treasures of silver and gold, and great glory. He built storehouses for his treasures, for grain, wine, and oil. He also built stalls for all types of livestock and folds for sheep.
2 Chronicles 32:28 He also built cities and acquired an innumerable multitude of herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, and droves of pigs.
2 Chronicles 32:29 He built cities for himself and acquired countless possessions of sheep and cattle, for God had indeed given him very great wealth.
2 Chronicles 32:30 This was the same Hezekiah who blocked up the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them underground, bringing them to the west side of the City of David. All his undertakings were successful; everything that he did prospered.
2 Chronicles 32:31 Nevertheless, concerning the delegation of the princes of Babylon, who had been sent to him to inquire about the astounding sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to be tested. This was so that everything that was in Hezekiah's heart might be revealed and known.
2 Chronicles 32:32 Now, the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his deeds of mercy, are recorded in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 32:33 Hezekiah rested with his ancestors, and they buried him in the highest part of the tombs of the sons of David. All of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And Manasseh, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 33:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 33:2 But he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, imitating the detestable practices of the pagan nations whom the Lord had driven out from the land before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33:3 He turned back and rebuilt the high places for pagan worship that his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He also erected altars for the Baals and made Asherah poles. He worshipped all the host of heaven—celestial bodies considered deities—and served them.
2 Chronicles 33:4 He even built altars for these pagan gods inside the house of the Lord, concerning which the Lord had said, 'My Name shall be in Jerusalem forever.'
2 Chronicles 33:5 He built altars for all the host of heaven—the celestial deities—in both courtyards of the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 33:6 Indeed, he even burned his own sons as sacrifices in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom. He practiced divination, followed omens, engaged in sorcery, and consulted with mediums and spirits of the dead. He multiplied evil in the sight of the Lord, so as to provoke Him to anger.
2 Chronicles 33:7 He carved an idol, an engraved image, and set it up in the temple of the Lord, concerning which the Lord had spoken to David and to Solomon his son, saying, 'In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My Name forever.'
2 Chronicles 33:8 And I will no longer move the foot of Israel from the land which I delivered to their fathers; that is, only if they carefully keep all that I have commanded them—the whole Law, the ceremonies, and the judgments given through Moses.
2 Chronicles 33:9 So Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray, causing them to do more evil than the pagan nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33:10 The Lord spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they refused to listen to Him.
2 Chronicles 33:11 Therefore, the Lord brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of the Assyrians. When they captured Manasseh, they bound him with chains and fetters and brought him to Babylon as a prisoner.
2 Chronicles 33:12 While he was in distress, he earnestly prayed to the Lord his God. He repented deeply before the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles 33:13 He pleaded with Him, imploring Him beyond measure, and God heard him. God brought him back to Jerusalem, to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord Himself was God.
2 Chronicles 33:14 After this, he built an outer wall for the City of David, to the west of Gihon in the valley, and from the entrance of the Fish Gate all around to Ophel. He raised it to a great height. He also appointed commanders of the army in all the fortified cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles 33:15 He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the Lord. He also commanded that all the altars he had built on the mountain of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem be taken away and cast far outside the city.
2 Chronicles 33:16 He also restored the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings upon it. He commanded Judah to serve the Lord, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33:17 Nevertheless, the people still offered sacrifices on the high places, though they were now dedicated to the Lord their God.
2 Chronicles 33:18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him—these are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33:19 His prayer also, and how God heard it, and all his sins and his contempt for God, and the places where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols—before he repented—these are written in the book of the seers (Hozai).
2 Chronicles 33:20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And Amon his son reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 33:21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 33:22 He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, just as Manasseh his father had done. He sacrificed to all the idols that Manasseh had made, and he served them.
2 Chronicles 33:23 He did not humble himself before the Lord, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself. Indeed, Amon sinned much more grievously than his father.
2 Chronicles 33:24 When his servants conspired against him, they killed him in his own house.
2 Chronicles 33:25 But the rest of the people killed all those who had conspired against Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.
2 Chronicles 34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to rule as king, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 34:2 And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord,
walking in the righteous ways of his ancestor David,
without deviating either to the right or to the left.
2 Chronicles 34:3 In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a young man,
he began to seek the true God of his ancestor David.
Then, in the twelfth year, he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem
from all the false worship at the high places,
destroying the sacred groves, and breaking down all the carved idols
and molten images used in pagan rituals.
2 Chronicles 34:4 Before King Josiah, his men tore down the altars dedicated to Baal worship.
He utterly demolished the idols that had been placed on top of these altars.
Then he cut down all the sacred groves and shattered the carved images into fragments.
Finally, he scattered these fragments over the graves of those who had offered sacrifices to these false gods.
2 Chronicles 34:5 He also burned the bones of the pagan priests upon their idolatrous altars.
Through these acts, he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem from defilement.
2 Chronicles 34:6 And in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, and extending even to Naphtali,
he thoroughly destroyed all the places of worship,
overthrowing the altars.
2 Chronicles 34:7 He crushed the sacred groves and carved images into tiny pieces.
He demolished every single idolatrous altar throughout the entire land of Israel.
After this extensive work, he returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 34:8 Then, in the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had cleansed the land and the Temple from pagan worship,
King Josiah sent Zadok the son of Ezekiel, and Raiah the son of Maaseiah, and Joah the son of Joahaz, the chancellor,
with a mission to restore and repair the House of the Lord, their God.
2 Chronicles 34:9 These men came to Hilkiah the high priest and received from him the money
that had been brought into the House of the Lord.
This money had been contributed by the Levites and the gatekeepers
from the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the rest of Israel,
as well as from all of Judah and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 34:10 They then gave the money into the hand of those who were overseeing the workers in the House of the Lord.
These overseers were to distribute it to the laborers who were working on the Temple,
specifically for the restoration of the Temple's upper parts and structures.
2 Chronicles 34:11 They also gave funds to the craftsmen and masons,
so they could purchase quarried stones and timber
for the structural joints of the building and for the roofing and beams.
2 Chronicles 34:12 All of these workers carried out their tasks faithfully.
The Levites appointed as supervisors for the work were Jahath and Obadiah, sons of Merari,
and Zechariah and Meshullam, from the sons of Kohath; these men diligently urged on the work.
Other Levites, all skilled in musical instruments, were also involved.
2 Chronicles 34:13 Moreover, those who were overseeing the masons and each individual task,
assigned their own men to various duties.
These included Levites who were educated as scribes, as well as overseers and gatekeepers.
2 Chronicles 34:14 As they were taking out the money that had been brought into the Temple of the Lord,
Hilkiah the priest discovered the book of the Law of the Lord, written by the hand of Moses.
2 Chronicles 34:15 Hilkiah then said to Shaphan the scribe,
"I have found the book of the Law in the House of the Lord!"
And he gave the book to Shaphan.
2 Chronicles 34:16 Shaphan then brought the book to the king and reported to him, saying,
"All the money that was given into the hand of your servants has been accounted for and disbursed."
2 Chronicles 34:17 He continued, "They have even melted down the silver that was found in the House of the Lord,
and they have given it to the overseers of the craftsmen and to the artisans."
2 Chronicles 34:18 Shaphan then added, "Furthermore, I have found a book in the House of the Lord."
And Shaphan presented the book to the king.
2 Chronicles 34:19 When the king read the words of the Law and heard its pronouncements,
he was so distressed that he tore his garments in a sign of repentance and mourning.
2 Chronicles 34:20 Then King Josiah commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, the king's servant, saying:
2 Chronicles 34:21 "Go and inquire of the Lord for me, and for the remnant of Israel and Judah,
concerning all the words of the book that has been found.
For great indeed is the wrath of the Lord that has been poured out upon us,
because our fathers did not keep the words of the Lord,
and did not do all that is written in this very book."
2 Chronicles 34:22 So Hilkiah and those who had been sent with him by the king went to Huldah the prophetess.
She was the wife of Shallum, the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the wardrobe.
She resided in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter of the city.
They spoke to her the words which we have related above.
2 Chronicles 34:23 She answered them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel:
'Say to the man who sent you to me:
2 Chronicles 34:24 Thus says the Lord: 'Behold, I am bringing disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants,
all the curses that are written in this book which they have read before the king of Judah:
2 Chronicles 34:25 Because they have forsaken Me and have offered sacrifices to foreign gods,
provoking Me to righteous anger with all the works of their hands,
therefore My burning wrath will be poured out upon this place and it will not be extinguished.'"
2 Chronicles 34:26 But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, you shall say this:
"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel:
2 Chronicles 34:27 Because your heart was softened when you heard the words of the book,
and you humbled yourself before God concerning what was spoken against this place and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
and because you humbled yourself before Me, and tore your garments, and wept before Me,
I have indeed heard you, declares the Lord.
2 Chronicles 34:28 Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be brought to your tomb in peace.
Your eyes will not see all the evil that I am bringing upon this place and upon its inhabitants."
So they reported to the king all that Huldah had said.
2 Chronicles 34:29 Therefore, the king convened all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 34:30 Then the king went up to the House of the Lord,
and with him went all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the priests, the Levites, and all the people, from the least to the greatest.
In their hearing, the king read all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the House of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 34:31 The king stood in his place of authority and made a solemn covenant before the Lord:
that he would walk after the Lord and keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes
with all his heart and with all his soul,
and that he would fulfill all that was written in that book which had been found.
2 Chronicles 34:32 He also compelled all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand by this covenant.
And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted according to the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 34:33 So Josiah removed all the abominations from all the regions of the sons of Israel.
He made all who remained in Israel serve the Lord their God.
Throughout all his days, they did not turn away from the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 35:1 Josiah celebrated the Lord's Passover in Jerusalem, and they sacrificed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.
2 Chronicles 35:2 He appointed the priests to their duties and strengthened them for the service of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 35:3 Then he spoke to the Levites, whose name was sacred among all Israel and who were consecrated to the Lord, saying: "Place the Ark in the temple that Solomon, the son of David, King of Israel, built. Let it no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now, serve the Lord your God and His people, Israel."
2 Chronicles 35:4 And prepare yourselves according to your families and clans in their respective divisions, just as David, the king of Israel, commanded and as Solomon, his son, wrote.
2 Chronicles 35:5 Serve in the sanctuary by your Levitical families and groups, with your brethren, the sons of the people, presiding, and by the courses of the Levitical clans.
2 Chronicles 35:6 And sacrifice the Passover lambs. Consecrate yourselves and prepare your brethren to act according to the word of the Lord, which He spoke through Moses.
2 Chronicles 35:7 Josiah also gave to the people, from his own royal possessions, for the celebration of the Passover, thirty thousand lambs and young goats from all the flocks, and three thousand oxen.
2 Chronicles 35:8 His officials also freely offered gifts, both to the people and to the priests and Levites. Furthermore, Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the chiefs of the house of the Lord, gave to the priests for the Passover sacrifice two thousand six hundred sheep and three hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles 35:9 Also Conaniah, Shemaiah, and Nethanel, his brethren, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the celebration of the Passover five thousand sheep and five hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles 35:10 So everything was prepared, and the priests stood in their offices, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king's command.
2 Chronicles 35:11 And they sacrificed the Passover lambs. The priests then offered the blood, receiving it from the hands of the Levites, and the Levites took care of the skins.
2 Chronicles 35:12 They then set aside the burnt offerings according to what is written in the book of Moses; likewise for the oxen, as is the custom.
2 Chronicles 35:13 And they cooked the Passover lambs with fire, as the Law requires. The burnt offerings, however, they boiled in pots, cauldrons, and pans, and they quickly distributed them to all the people.
2 Chronicles 35:14 After this, the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were occupied with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until nightfall. For this reason, the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
2 Chronicles 35:15 Furthermore, the singers, the sons of Asaph, stood in their appointed places according to the command of David, and Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's prophets. The gatekeepers were also at each gate.
2 Chronicles 35:16 So all the service of the Lord was duly celebrated on that day, as they made the Passover and offered burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord according to the command of King Josiah.
2 Chronicles 35:17 And the children of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover at that time, along with the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
2 Chronicles 35:18 Therefore, there had been no Passover like this in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet. Nor had any of the kings of Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah performed with the priests, the Levites, all Judah, and the Israelites who were present, and those living in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 35:19 This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.
2 Chronicles 35:20 After Josiah had duly completed all these things in the temple, Neco, king of Egypt, went up to fight at Carchemish by the Euphrates. And Josiah went out to meet him in battle.
2 Chronicles 35:21 But Neco sent messengers to him, saying: "What business do I have with you, King of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against another house, to which I am hastening. Refrain from opposing me, lest you destroy yourself. For God has commanded me to hurry. Stop opposing God, who is with me, lest He destroy you."
2 Chronicles 35:22 Josiah, however, refused to turn back, but prepared for battle against Neco. He would not listen to the words of Neco, which came from the mouth of God, but went to fight in the plain of Megiddo.
2 Chronicles 35:23 There, being wounded by archers, he said to his servants: "Take me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded."
2 Chronicles 35:24 And his servants carried him from his chariot into another chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. He died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.
2 Chronicles 35:25 Jeremiah also composed a lamentation for Josiah. And all the male and female singers recite their lamentations over Josiah even to this present day, and it became like a custom in Israel. Indeed, it is written in the Lamentations.
2 Chronicles 35:26 Now the rest of the deeds of Josiah, his acts of devotion, and his works, are written according to what is written in the Law of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 35:27 Both his former and latter deeds are written in the book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 36:1 So the people living in the land of Judah took Josiah’s son, Jehoahaz. They then made him king in Jerusalem, to reign in place of his father, Josiah.
2 Chronicles 36:2 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began his reign. He only reigned for three months in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36:3 But the king of Egypt removed him from his throne, preventing him from ruling any longer in Jerusalem. And that king imposed a heavy tax on the land: one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.
2 Chronicles 36:4 The king of Egypt then made Jehoahaz’s brother, Eliakim, the new king in his place. He changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. As for Jehoahaz himself, the Egyptian king had taken him away and brought him to Egypt.
2 Chronicles 36:5 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began his reign. He reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. He did evil things in the sight of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles 36:6 Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came up against Jehoiakim. He bound him with chains and took him away as a prisoner to Babylon.
2 Chronicles 36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the sacred vessels from the Lord’s Temple. He placed these holy items in his own pagan temple in Babylon.
2 Chronicles 36:8 The rest of the account of Jehoiakim’s reign, including the detestable things he did, and what was found concerning him, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. Then his son, Jehoiachin, became king in his place.
2 Chronicles 36:9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began his reign. He reigned for three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He also did evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 36:10 At the beginning of the new year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent men and had Jehoiachin brought to Babylon. At the same time, Nebuchadnezzar took away the most precious vessels from the Lord’s Temple. He then appointed Zedekiah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, as the new king over Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36:11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began his reign. He reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36:12 He did evil in the sight of the Lord his God. He did not humble himself before the prophet Jeremiah, even though Jeremiah spoke to him directly from the mouth of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 36:13 Furthermore, Zedekiah also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear an oath of loyalty by invoking God’s name. Zedekiah stubbornly stiffened his neck and hardened his heart, refusing to turn back to the Lord, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 36:14 Moreover, all the chief priests and the people in general were utterly wicked. They multiplied their detestable practices, adopting all the abominations of the pagan nations around them. In doing so, they defiled the Lord’s Temple, the very house that God Himself had consecrated in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36:15 The Lord, the God of their ancestors, continually sent messengers to His people. He rose early and sent them again and again, warning them daily. He did this because He felt compassion for His people and for His dwelling place, the Temple.
2 Chronicles 36:16 But the people mocked God’s messengers. They scorned His words and scoffed at His prophets. They continued this until the Lord’s wrath was so kindled against His people that there was no remedy or cure left for them.
2 Chronicles 36:17 Therefore, the Lord brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, Nebuchadnezzar. He slaughtered their young men with the sword right within their own sanctuary, the Temple. He showed no pity for young men, nor for virgins, nor for the elderly, nor even for the very weak. He gave all of them into the hands of the Chaldean king.
2 Chronicles 36:18 All the vessels of the Lord’s Temple—both the large and small ones—and the treasures of the Temple, along with the treasures of the king and his officials, Nebuchadnezzar delivered all of these into the Chaldean king’s hands.
2 Chronicles 36:19 The enemies, the Chaldeans, set fire to God’s house, the Temple. They tore down the walls of Jerusalem. They burned all the fortified towers and demolished everything that had been valuable and precious.
2 Chronicles 36:20 Those who escaped the sword were led away as captives to Babylon. There, they became servants to Nebuchadnezzar and his descendants, until the kingdom of Persia began to reign.
2 Chronicles 36:21 This all happened so that the word of the Lord, spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, might be fulfilled. The land of Judah finally enjoyed its Sabbaths. Throughout all the days of its desolation, the land kept Sabbath rest until seventy years were completed, as prophesied.
2 Chronicles 36:22 In the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord that He had spoken through Jeremiah, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus. So Cyrus issued a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom, even in writing, saying:
2 Chronicles 36:23 “Thus says Cyrus, the king of Persia: ‘The Lord, the God of the universe, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He Himself has commanded me to build Him a house of worship in Jerusalem, which is located in Judea.’
Ezra 1:1 In the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, so that the prophecy of the Lord, spoken through Jeremiah, would be fulfilled, the Lord moved the heart of Cyrus, the king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom, even by written decree, saying:
Ezra 1:2 This is what Cyrus, the king of Persia, says: 'The Lord, the God of the universe, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He Himself has commanded me to build Him a Temple in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.'
Ezra 1:3 'Who among you is of all His people? May his God be with him. Let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the Temple of the Lord, the God of Israel—for He is the God whose presence is in Jerusalem.'
Ezra 1:4 'And all the others, in every place where they dwell, let the men from their own places help those returning to Jerusalem with silver and with gold, and with goods, and with livestock, besides the voluntary offerings they give for the Temple of God which is in Jerusalem.'
Ezra 1:5 Then the heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin arose, as did the priests and the Levites, and everyone whose spirit God had moved, to go up and build the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem.
Ezra 1:6 And all those who were around them helped them with silver and gold articles, with goods, and with livestock, and with valuable things, besides what they offered willingly.
Ezra 1:7 King Cyrus also brought out the articles of the Temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his own god.
Ezra 1:8 These King Cyrus of Persia brought out through the hand of Mithridates, the son of Gazabar, and he counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
Ezra 1:9 And this is their number: thirty gold basins, one thousand and one silver basins, twenty-nine knives,
Ezra 1:10 thirty gold cups, four hundred and ten secondary-grade silver cups, and one thousand other articles.
Ezra 1:11 All the gold and silver articles totaled five thousand four hundred. Sheshbazzar brought all these out with those who were going up from the exile, from Babylon to Jerusalem.
Ezra 1:12 Now these are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had carried away to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city.
Ezra 1:13 Those who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:
Ezra 1:14 the children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy-two.
Ezra 1:15 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy-two.
Ezra 1:16 The children of Arah, seven hundred seventy-five.
Ezra 1:17 The children of Pahath-Moab, of the children of Jeshua, two thousand eight hundred twelve.

Ezra 2:1 These are the people from the province of Judah who came back from exile. They were the ones who had been taken captive by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and brought to Babylon. Now they returned to Jerusalem and the land of Judah, each person going to their own city.
Ezra 2:2 They returned with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. This is the total number of men of the people of Israel:

Ezra 3:1 The seventh month of the year had arrived—the time for the Feast of Tabernacles—and the Israelites were dwelling in their towns, but the people gathered together as one unified group in Jerusalem.
Ezra 3:2 Then Joshua, son of Jehozadak, rose up with his brother priests, and Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, with his brothers. They built an altar to the God of Israel so that they could offer burnt offerings on it, just as it is written in the Law given to Moses, the man of God.
Ezra 3:3 They set the altar on its proper foundations, even though they were afraid of the local peoples in the surrounding lands. Then they offered burnt offerings upon it to the Lord, both in the morning and in the evening.
Ezra 3:4 They then celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles, just as it is written in the Law. They offered the required number of burnt offerings each day, following the prescribed ceremony, ensuring that the work for each day was completed on its proper day.
Ezra 3:5 After this, they offered the regular daily burnt offering, as well as those for the new moons, and for all the Lord's consecrated feast days. They also offered sacrifices for everyone who willingly offered sacrifices to the Lord.
Ezra 3:6 From the first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord, even though the foundation for the Lord's Temple had not yet been laid.
Ezra 3:7 They gave money to the stonemasons and carpenters for their work. They also provided food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians so that they would transport cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa. This was all done according to the command that had been given by Cyrus, the king of Persia.
Ezra 3:8 In the second year of their arrival at the Temple of God in Jerusalem, specifically in the second month, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, son of Jehozadak, along with their fellow priests and Levites and all the others who had returned from captivity to Jerusalem, began the work. They appointed Levites who were twenty years of age or older to oversee the construction work for the Lord's Temple.
Ezra 3:9 Joshua, his sons, and his brothers stood together with Kadmiel and his sons, and the sons of Judah, as one unified group, to supervise those who were working on the Temple of God. This supervisory group also included the sons of Henadad with their sons, and their brothers the Levites.
Ezra 3:10 When the masons had laid the foundation of the Lord's Temple, the priests stood dressed in their sacred robes, holding trumpets. The Levites, who were descendants of Asaph, stood with cymbals. They were there to praise God, following the musical instructions and arrangements that had been established by David, king of Israel.
Ezra 3:11 They sang responsively in hymns and gave thanks to the Lord, singing: "For He is good, for His mercy endures forever over Israel." All the people then shouted with a great and loud cheer, praising the Lord because the foundation of the Lord's Temple had finally been laid.
Ezra 3:12 Many of the priests, Levites, and the older heads of families who had seen the glory of the first Temple, upon seeing the foundations of this new, first Temple, wept with a loud cry of sorrow and remembrance. At the same time, many others shouted for joy, raising their voices in celebration.
Ezra 3:13 And so, no one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of the people weeping, because the crowds were shouting and crying out with such great loudness that the sound was heard from far away.
Ezra 4:1 But the enemies of the people of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returning exiles were building a temple for the Lord, the God of Israel.
Ezra 4:2 These enemies approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families, saying, 'Let us build with you, because we also seek your God, just as you do. We have been offering sacrifices to him—the God of Israel—since the days of Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria, who brought us here to this land.'
Ezra 4:3 But Zerubbabel and Joshua, along with the rest of the heads of the families of Israel, said to them, 'You have no part with us in building a house for our God. We alone will build for the Lord, the God of Israel, just as Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us.'
Ezra 4:4 Therefore, the local inhabitants of the land began to discourage the people of Judah and frustrate their efforts in building.
Ezra 4:5 They even hired counselors to work against the people of Judah, to thwart their plans during all the days that Cyrus was king of Persia and even until the reign of Darius, the next king of Persia.
Ezra 4:6 Now, in the reign of Ahasuerus, at the very beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra 4:7 And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their associates wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes of Persia. The accusation was written in the Aramaic language, and it was read aloud.
Ezra 4:8 Rehum, the commander, and Shimshai, the scribe, wrote a letter concerning Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes in the following manner:
Ezra 4:9 From Rehum, the commander, and Shimshai, the scribe, and the rest of their associates—the judges, the officials from Apharsath, the people from Tarphel, the people from Aphars, the people from Erech, the Babylonians, the people from Susa, the people from Deha, and the Elamites—
Ezra 4:10 And the rest of the nations whom Osnappar—the great and glorious official—had carried away and settled in the cities of Samaria and in the other regions beyond the Euphrates River, and so forth, greeting.
Ezra 4:11 This is a copy of the letter they sent to King Artaxerxes: 'Your servants, the men who are beyond the Euphrates River, send greetings.'
Ezra 4:12 'Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from your presence to us have arrived in Jerusalem, that rebellious and wicked city. They are rebuilding it, raising its walls, and repairing its structures.'
Ezra 4:13 'Therefore, let it now be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, they will not pay tribute, customs, or tolls. This will be harmful to all the kings who rule over these lands.'
Ezra 4:14 'Now, because we are mindful of our duty to the palace—remembering the salt we have eaten in the king's service—and because it is not fitting to allow disrespect to the king, we have therefore sent this message to inform the king.'
Ezra 4:15 'We suggest that a search be made in the historical records of your predecessors. You will find it written in the chronicles, and you will learn that this city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, and it was for this very reason that it was laid waste in the past.'
Ezra 4:16 'We also inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, then you will no longer have any claim or possession in the region beyond the Euphrates River.'
Ezra 4:17 Then the king sent his reply to Rehum, the commander, to Shimshai, the scribe, and to the rest of their associates who lived in Samaria and in the other regions beyond the Euphrates River, saying, 'Greetings and peace!'
Ezra 4:18 'The letter that you sent to us has been plainly read in my presence.'
Ezra 4:19 'I then issued a command, and a search was conducted. It was found that this city has indeed been rebellious against kings since ancient times, and sedition and rebellion have occurred within it.'
Ezra 4:20 'For even mighty kings have reigned in Jerusalem who ruled over all the region beyond the Euphrates River, and they also collected tribute, customs, and tolls from others.'
Ezra 4:21 'Therefore, now issue an order to stop these men. This city is not to be rebuilt until I give a further command.'
Ezra 4:22 'See to it that you do not neglect this matter. Why should evil continue to grow, to the detriment and harm of the kings?'
Ezra 4:23 So, when the copy of King Artaxerxes' decree was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they quickly went to Jerusalem to the Jews. They stopped them by force and with military power.
Ezra 4:24 Then the work on the house of God in Jerusalem was stopped. It remained unfinished until the second year of the reign of Darius, the king of Persia.
Ezra 5:1 Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, proclaimed God's message to the Jews who were living in Judah and Jerusalem, doing so in the name of the God of Israel.
Ezra 5:2 Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, rose up and began to build the Temple of God in Jerusalem, and the prophets of God were with them, helping them in their work.
Ezra 5:3 At that same time, Tattenai, who was the governor of the region beyond the Euphrates River, along with Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, came to them. They questioned the builders, asking, “Who gave you the authority to construct this House of God and to complete these walls?”
Ezra 5:4 We answered them by stating the names of the men who were building that House of God.
Ezra 5:5 However, the eyes of their God were upon the elders of the Jews, and the officials could not stop them until the matter was reported to King Darius and a decision on this issue was received.
Ezra 5:6 This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor of the region beyond the Euphrates River, along with Shethar-Bozenai and his associates, the Apharsachites, who were also from beyond the River, sent to King Darius.
Ezra 5:7 The message they sent to him was as follows: “To King Darius: May you have complete peace and prosperity.
Ezra 5:8 Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the House of the Great God, which is being built with large stones, and timber is being laid in its walls. This work is being carried out diligently, and it is progressing well in their hands.
Ezra 5:9 And we questioned those elders, asking, ‘Who gave you the authority to build this House of God and to complete these walls?’
Ezra 5:10 We also asked them for their names so that we could report back to you and write down the names of the men who are their leaders.
Ezra 5:11 But they gave us this response, saying: ‘We are servants of the God of Heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the Temple which was built many years ago, and which a great king of Israel had built and established.’
Ezra 5:12 ‘However, because our fathers provoked the God of Heaven to anger, He delivered them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldean. And that king destroyed this House of God and carried its people away to Babylon.
Ezra 5:13 ‘Nevertheless, in the first year of Cyrus, the King of Babylon, King Cyrus himself issued an order for this House of God to be rebuilt.
Ezra 5:14 ‘Indeed, even the gold and silver vessels of the Temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem and carried off to the temple in Babylon, King Cyrus brought out from the temple in Babylon. They were handed over to a man named Sheshbazzar, who was a prince.
Ezra 5:15 ‘And Cyrus said to him: “Take these vessels, go, and place them in the Temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the House of God be rebuilt on its original site.”
Ezra 5:16 ‘Then, therefore, this same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem. From that time until now, it has been under construction, but it is not yet finished.
Ezra 5:17 ‘And now, if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives, which are in Babylon, to determine whether it was indeed decreed by King Cyrus that this House of God in Jerusalem should be rebuilt. And let the king's will concerning this matter be sent to us.’

Ezra 6:1 Then King Darius sent letters, and an investigation was made in the royal library of books, where he had stored the royal treasures.
Ezra 6:2 And a single scroll was found in Ecbatana, which is a fortress city in the region of Media. This is what was written on it:
Ezra 6:3 In the first year of King Cyrus’s reign, King Cyrus issued a decree concerning the House of God which is in Jerusalem: “Let a temple be built, a place where burnt offerings may be sacrificed. Let its foundation be laid solid: its height should be sixty cubits, and its width sixty cubits.
Ezra 6:4 Let there be three courses of undressed stones and one course of new timbers. And the expenses for this shall be paid from the king’s treasury.
Ezra 6:5 Furthermore, let the gold and silver vessels of the Temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple of Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned. Let them be carried back to the Temple in Jerusalem to their proper place, and be set up in the House of God.”
Ezra 6:6 “Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Bozenai, and your colleagues, the officials of the region beyond the River—keep yourselves far away from them.
Ezra 6:7 Allow the work on that House of God to proceed, so that they may rebuild that Temple in its proper place, and let the elders of the Jews build the House of God.
Ezra 6:8 Furthermore, I have decreed what is to be done for the elders of the Jews, so that they may build this House of God. That is to say, from the king’s treasury—from the taxes that are collected from the region beyond the River—expenses are to be diligently given to those men, so that the work may not cease.
Ezra 6:9 And if anything else is needed, whether bulls, rams, or lambs for the burnt offerings to the God of the sky, or wheat, salt, wine, and oil according to the ritual of the priests of Jerusalem—let it be given to them day by day, so that there may be no delay or offense in anything.
Ezra 6:10 So that they may offer sacrifices to the God of the sky, and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
Ezra 6:11 Therefore, I have issued this decree: if any person alters this command, let a timber be taken from his house, and let him be impaled upon it, and let his house be confiscated by the state.
Ezra 6:12 And may the God who has made His Name dwell there overthrow every kingdom and people who stretches out their hand to attack and destroy that House of God which is in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree, and it must be diligently carried out.
Ezra 6:13 So then, Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Bozenai, and their colleagues, diligently carried out what King Darius had commanded.
Ezra 6:14 Meanwhile, the elders of the Jews were building and making good progress, in accordance with the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, the son of Iddo. They built and completed it according to the command of the God of Israel, and according to the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
Ezra 6:15 And this House of God was completed on the third day of the month of Adar, which was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
Ezra 6:16 Then the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, along with the rest of the returning exiles, joyfully celebrated the dedication of the House of God.
Ezra 6:17 For the dedication of the House of God, they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin offering for all of Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
Ezra 6:18 And they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites to their courses of service for the work of God in Jerusalem, just as it is written in the Book of Moses.
Ezra 6:19 The returning exiles of Israel also celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
Ezra 6:20 For the priests and Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean and ready to sacrifice the Passover lamb for all the returning exiles, and for their own brothers, the priests, and for themselves.
Ezra 6:21 And the children of Israel who had returned from exile ate the Passover meal, along with everyone who had separated themselves from the impurities of the peoples of the land to join them in seeking the Lord, the God of Israel.
Ezra 6:22 And they celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread with joy for seven days, because the Lord had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, thus helping them in the work on the House of the Lord, the God of Israel.
Ezra 7:1 After these historical events, during the reign of Artaxerxes, the king of the Persians, Ezra appeared. He was the son of Seraiah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Hilkiah,
Ezra 7:2 who was the son of Shallum, who was the son of Zadok, who was the son of Ahitub,
Ezra 7:3 who was the son of Amariah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Meraioth,
Ezra 7:4 who was the son of Zerahiah, who was the son of Bukki, who was the son of Abishua,
Ezra 7:5 who was the son of Phinehas, who was the son of Eleazar, who was the son of Aaron, the chief priest.
Ezra 7:6 This same Ezra came up from Babylon. He was an expert scribe in the Law of Moses, the Law which the Lord God of Israel had given. The king granted him every request he made, because the favor of the Lord his God was upon him.
Ezra 7:7 Some of the children of Israel also traveled up to Jerusalem with him, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and the Nethinim, in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes’ reign.
Ezra 7:8 Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was still in the seventh year of the king’s reign.
Ezra 7:9 Because on the first day of the first month, he began his journey from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month, he arrived in Jerusalem, protected by the good favor of his God upon him.
Ezra 7:10 For Ezra had committed himself fully to studying the Law of the Lord, to practicing it himself, and to teaching its statutes and ordinances to the people of Israel.
Ezra 7:11 Now this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra, the priest and scribe, who was expert in the words of the Lord’s commandments and His ritual practices in Israel.
Ezra 7:12 Artaxerxes, the king of all kings, to Ezra the priest, a scribe of the divine Law of God, sends greetings of peace.
Ezra 7:13 I have now issued a decree that anyone in my kingdom from the people of Israel, including their priests and Levites, who freely chooses to go to Jerusalem, is permitted to go with you.
Ezra 7:14 For you are sent from the king and his seven royal advisors to conduct an inspection of Judea and Jerusalem, in accordance with the Law of your God, which you possess.
Ezra 7:15 You are also to carry the silver and gold that the king and his advisors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose Temple is in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:16 And you are to bring all the silver and gold that you have gathered throughout the entire province of Babylon, along with the freewill offerings of the people and the priests, which they have freely offered to the Temple of their God in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:17 With this money, you are diligently to purchase bulls, rams, and lambs, along with their accompanying grain offerings and drink offerings, and then offer them upon the altar of the Temple of your God in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:18 If you and your kinsmen decide to do anything further with the remaining silver and gold, you may do so, according to the will of your God.
Ezra 7:19 You are also to deliver all the vessels that have been entrusted to you for the service of the Temple of your God, placing them before God in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:20 Whatever else may be needed for the Temple of your God, and is provided to you, you shall furnish from the royal treasury and coffers.
Ezra 7:21 I, King Artaxerxes, have also issued a decree and a command to all the administrators of the treasury in the province Beyond the River: whatever Ezra, the priest and scribe of the divine Law of God, requests from you, must be given to him without delay.
Ezra 7:22 This includes up to one hundred talents of silver, up to one hundred kors of salt, up to one hundred baths of wine, up to one hundred baths of oil, and salt in any quantity needed.
Ezra 7:23 Whatever is required for the ritual practices of the Temple of the divine God, let it be given diligently from the king’s treasury, so that divine wrath may not fall upon the king and his children.
Ezra 7:24 We also make it known to you that regarding all the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, and other servants of this Temple of God, you are not to impose any taxes, tribute, or customs duties upon them.
Ezra 7:25 And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God, which is within you, are to appoint magistrates and judges who will administer justice to all the people in the province Beyond the River—that is, to all who know the Law of your God. You are also to instruct those who do not know it.
Ezra 7:26 Whoever fails to obey the Law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him swiftly: whether by death, or by banishment, or by forfeiture of goods, or by imprisonment.
Ezra 7:27 Blessed be the Lord, the God of our fathers, who put it into the heart of the king to beautify the Temple of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:28 And He has shown me favor before the king, his advisors, and all the king’s powerful officials. So, because the hand of the Lord my God was upon me and strengthened me, I gathered leaders from Israel to travel up with me.
Ezra 7:1 After these events, during the reign of Artaxerxes, the king of Persia, Ezra, who was the son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,
Ezra 7:2 who was the son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,
Ezra 7:3 who was the son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,
Ezra 7:4 who was the son of Zerahiah, son of Bocci, son of Abishua,
Ezra 7:5 who was the son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, who was the very first priest.
Ezra 7:6 This same Ezra came up from Babylon, and he was a scribe who was skilled in the law of Moses—the very law that the Lord, the God of Israel, had given. And the king, because God was with Ezra, granted him every request that he made.
Ezra 7:7 Some of the children of Israel came up with him, as well as some of the children of the priests, and some of the children of the Levites. Also, some of the singers, some of the gatekeepers, and some of the Nathinim—the temple servants—came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes' reign.
Ezra 7:8 Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month; this was still the seventh year of the king's reign.
Ezra 7:9 For on the first day of the first month, he began his journey from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month, he arrived in Jerusalem, because the good hand of his God was with him and guided him.
Ezra 7:10 Ezra had fully committed his heart to studying the Law of the Lord, to carrying it out, and to teaching God's decrees and judgments in Israel.
Ezra 7:11 This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra, the priest, who was a scribe well-versed in the words and decrees of the Lord, and in His rituals for Israel.
Ezra 7:12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra, the priest and scribe of the Law of the God of the universe—greetings.
Ezra 7:13 I have issued a decree that anyone in my kingdom from the people of Israel, and from their priests, and from their Levites, who willingly desires to go to Jerusalem, may go with you.
Ezra 7:14 For you are being sent by the king and his seven counselors to inspect Judea and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God, which is in your hand.
Ezra 7:15 And you are to carry silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have willingly offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling place is in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:16 Also, you are to bring all the silver and gold that you collect throughout the entire province of Babylon, along with whatever the people and the priests willingly offer as gifts for the house of their God, which is in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:17 You are to carefully use this money to buy bulls, rams, and lambs, as well as their grain offerings and their drink offerings. Then you shall offer them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:18 Furthermore, if you and your brothers decide to do anything else with the remaining silver and gold, you may do so according to the will of your God.
Ezra 7:19 The vessels that have been given to you for the service of the house of your God, you are to present them before God in Jerusalem.
Ezra 7:20 Whatever else you and your brothers need for the house of your God and its uses, you are to provide it from the royal treasury and the king's taxes.
Ezra 7:21 And I, Artaxerxes, the king, have issued a standing order and decree to all the treasurers in the region Beyond the River: whatever Ezra, the priest and scribe of the Law of the God of the universe, requests from you, it is to be provided without delay.
Ezra 7:22 up to one hundred talents of silver, up to one hundred cors of wheat, up to one hundred baths of wine, up to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without any limit.
Ezra 7:23 Whatever pertains to the ritual of the God of the universe, let it be carefully supplied from the treasury of the God of the universe, so that His wrath may not come upon my kingdom and upon my sons.
Ezra 7:24 We also make known to you concerning all the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nathinim—the temple servants—and other ministers of this house of God: you are not to impose tribute, or customs, or taxes on them.
Ezra 7:25 And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is within your power, are to appoint judges and magistrates to govern all the people who are in the region Beyond the River. You are to appoint those who know the Law of your God, and you are also to teach those who do not know it.
Ezra 7:26 And whoever does not obey the Law of your God and the law of the king, judgment is to be carried out against him—whether by death, by exile, by confiscation of property, or certainly by imprisonment.
Ezra 7:27 Blessed be the Lord, the God of our fathers, who put such a desire into the heart of the king to glorify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem,
Ezra 7:28 and who extended His mercy towards me before the king and his counselors, and before all the king's powerful princes. And I, being strengthened by the hand of the Lord my God, gathered leading men from Israel to come up with me.
Ezra 8:1 So, these are the heads of the ancestral families, and this is the official record of their lineage, all of whom returned to Jerusalem with me from Babylon, during the reign of King Artaxerxes.
Ezra 8:2 From the descendants of Phinehas was Gershom. From the descendants of Ithamar was Daniel. From the descendants of David was Hattush.
Ezra 8:3 From the descendants of Shecaniah, and from the descendants of Parosh, was Zechariah; and with him were counted one hundred and fifty men.
Ezra 8:4 From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Eliehoenai, the son of Zerahiah; and with him were two hundred men.
Ezra 8:5 From the descendants of Zattu: Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel; and with him were three hundred men.
Ezra 8:6 From the descendants of Adin: Ebed, the son of Jonathan; and with him were fifty men.
Ezra 8:7 From the descendants of Elam: Isaiah, the son of Athaliah; and with him were seventy men.
Ezra 8:8 From the descendants of Shephatiah: Zebadiah, the son of Michael; and with him were eighty men.
Ezra 8:9 From the descendants of Joab: Obadiah, the son of Jehiel; and with him were two hundred and eighteen men.
Ezra 8:10 From the descendants of Bani: Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah; and with him were one hundred and sixty men.
Ezra 8:11 From the descendants of Bebai: Zechariah, the son of Bebai; and with him were twenty-eight men.
Ezra 8:12 From the descendants of Azgad: Johanan, the son of Hakkatan; and with him were one hundred and ten men.
Ezra 8:13 From the descendants of Adonikam, who were the very last to arrive: and these are their names, Eliphelet, Jehiel, and Shemaiah; and with them were sixty men.
Ezra 8:14 From the descendants of Bigvai: Uthai and Zabbud; and with them were seventy men.
Ezra 8:15 Now, I assembled them near the river that flows towards Ahava, and we stayed there for three days. I examined the people and the priests for descendants of Levi, and I did not find any there.
Ezra 8:16 Therefore, I sent Eliezer, and Ariel, and Shemaiah, and Elnathan, and Jarib, and Elnathan, and Nathan, and Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were all leaders. I also sent Joiarib and Elnathan, who were wise men.
Ezra 8:17 And I sent them to Iddo, who was the chief man in the place called Casiphia. I put words in their mouths, instructing them what to say to Iddo and his Nethinim brothers in Casiphia, so that they would bring us ministers for the house of our God.
Ezra 8:18 And they brought us, by the good hand of our God upon us, a very learned man from the descendants of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel: namely, Sherebiah, with his sons and his eighteen brothers.
Ezra 8:19 They also brought Hashabiah, and with him Isaiah from the descendants of Merari, with his brothers and their twenty sons.
Ezra 8:20 And from the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, they brought two hundred and twenty Nethinim. All these were designated by name.
Ezra 8:21 And there, beside the Ahava River, I proclaimed a fast so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask Him for a safe journey for us, our children, and all our possessions.
Ezra 8:22 For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the journey. This was because we had told the king: 'The hand of our God is upon all those who seek Him for good, but His power, strength, and anger are against all who abandon Him.'
Ezra 8:23 So we fasted and pleaded with our God for this, and He was gracious to us.
Ezra 8:24 Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah and Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them.
Ezra 8:25 And I weighed out to them the silver, gold, and the consecrated vessels for the house of our God, which the king, his counselors, his officials, and all of Israel who were present had offered.
Ezra 8:26 I weighed into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, one hundred silver vessels, and one hundred talents of gold.
Ezra 8:27 Also, twenty gold bowls, which were worth a thousand gold coins, and two excellent vessels of shining bronze, as beautiful as gold.
Ezra 8:28 And I said to them: 'You are holy to the Lord, and the vessels are holy. This silver and gold has been willingly offered to the Lord, the God of our ancestors.
Ezra 8:29 Watch over them and guard them until you weigh them out in Jerusalem before the chief priests, the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel, in the treasury of the Lord's house.'
Ezra 8:30 So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver, gold, and vessels, to carry them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
Ezra 8:31 So we set out from the Ahava River on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush on the way.
Ezra 8:32 And we arrived in Jerusalem and stayed there for three days.
Ezra 8:33 On the fourth day, the silver, gold, and vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth, son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar, son of Phinehas. Also present were the Levites Jozabad, son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, son of Binnui.
Ezra 8:34 We carefully counted and weighed everything, and the weight of each individual item was recorded in writing. The total sum was immediately documented.
Ezra 8:35 The people who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering—all of them as a burnt offering to the Lord.
Ezra 8:36 They also delivered the king's edicts to the satraps who were under the king's authority and to the governors beyond the River Euphrates. And these officials then gave their support to the people and to the house of God.
Ezra 8:37 And after these events, the leaders approached me, saying: 'The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the peoples of these lands and from their abominations. This includes the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.'
Ezra 8:38 'For they have taken wives from the daughters of these peoples for themselves and for their sons, and they have mixed the holy seed—the chosen people of God—with the peoples of these lands. Indeed, the hands of the leaders and officials have been foremost in this transgression.'
Ezra 8:39 When I heard this report, I tore my garments and my cloak, and I pulled out hair from my head and my beard, and I sat down in utter grief and despair.
Ezra 8:40 And all those who feared the word of the God of Israel gathered around me, because of the transgression of those who had returned from captivity. And I remained sitting in sorrow until the time of the evening sacrifice.
Ezra 8:1 These are the heads of the ancestral families, and this is the list of their descendants, who ascended with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes.
Ezra 8:2 From the descendants of Phinehas, there was Gershom; from the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; from the descendants of David, Hattush.
Ezra 8:3 From the descendants of Shechaniah, and from the descendants of Parosh, there was Zechariah, and with him were counted one hundred and fifty men.
Ezra 8:4 From the descendants of Pahath-Moab, there was Eliehoenai, son of Zerahiah, and with him were two hundred men.
Ezra 8:5 From the descendants of Shechaniah, there was the son of Jahaziel, and with him were three hundred men.
Ezra 8:6 From the descendants of Adin, there was Ebed, son of Jonathan, and with him were fifty men.
Ezra 8:7 From the descendants of Elam, there was Isaiah, son of Athaliah, and with him were seventy men.
Ezra 8:8 From the descendants of Shephatiah, there was Zebadiah, son of Michael, and with him were eighty men.
Ezra 8:9 From the descendants of Joab, there was Obadiah, son of Jehiel, and with him were two hundred and eighteen men.
Ezra 8:10 From the descendants of Bani, there was Shelomith, son of Josiphiah, and with him were one hundred and sixty men.
Ezra 8:11 From the descendants of Bebai, there was Zechariah, son of Bebai, and with him were twenty-eight men.
Ezra 8:12 From the descendants of Azgad, there was Johanan, son of Hakkatan, and with him were one hundred and ten men.
Ezra 8:13 From the descendants of Adonikam, who were the last to arrive from that family, these were their names: Eliphelet, Jehiel, and Shemaiah, and with them were sixty men.
Ezra 8:14 From the descendants of Bigvai, there were Uthai and Zabbud, and with them were seventy men.
Ezra 8:15 I gathered them by the river that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there for three days. As I inspected the people and the priests, I found no one there from the descendants of Levi.
Ezra 8:16 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leading men. I also sent for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were wise teachers.
Ezra 8:17 I sent them to Iddo, who was the chief at a place called Casiphia. I gave them specific instructions about what to say to Iddo and his relatives, the Nethinim, who were living in Casiphia—all with the purpose of bringing us ministers for the house of our God.
Ezra 8:18 And through the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a highly skilled man from the descendants of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel—that was Sherebiah, with his sons and brothers, a total of eighteen men.
Ezra 8:19 They also brought Hashabiah, and with him, from the descendants of Merari, Isaiah, along with his brothers and his sons, a total of twenty men.
Ezra 8:20 And from the Nethinim, whom King David and the leaders had assigned to assist the Levites in their service, they brought two hundred and twenty Nethinim; all these were designated by name.
Ezra 8:21 There, by the Ahava River, I proclaimed a fast for everyone. This was so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask Him for a safe and proper journey for ourselves, our children, and all our possessions.
Ezra 8:22 I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from our enemies along the way. This was because we had already told the king, 'The hand of our God is good and protects all those who seek Him with sincerity, but His power, strength, and wrath are against all who abandon Him.'
Ezra 8:23 So we fasted and sought help from our God through prayer for this very reason, and He was gracious to us.
Ezra 8:24 Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah and Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers.
Ezra 8:25 I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the sacred vessels intended for the house of our God—these were offerings that the king, his counselors, his officials, and all the Israelites present had contributed.
Ezra 8:26 I weighed into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, one hundred silver vessels, and one hundred talents of gold.
Ezra 8:27 Also, twenty gold bowls, which were worth a thousand gold darics (gold coins), and two vessels of fine, burnished bronze, which were as valuable as gold.
Ezra 8:28 Then I said to them: 'You are consecrated to the Lord, and these vessels are sacred. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the Lord, the God of our fathers.'
Ezra 8:29 'Watch over them and guard them carefully until you weigh them out in Jerusalem, in the presence of the leading priests, the Levites, and the heads of the Israelite families, and place them in the treasury of the house of the Lord.'
Ezra 8:30 So the priests and the Levites received the exact weight of the silver, gold, and vessels, with the responsibility to transport them to Jerusalem for the house of our God.
Ezra 8:31 Then, on the twelfth day of the first month—the month of Nisan—we departed from the Ahava River to journey to Jerusalem. The good hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the power of the enemy and from ambushers along the road.
Ezra 8:32 We arrived in Jerusalem and rested there for three days.
Ezra 8:33 On the fourth day, the silver, gold, and vessels were weighed out in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth, son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar, son of Phinehas. The Levites present were Jozabad, son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, son of Binnui.
Ezra 8:34 Everything was accounted for by number and by weight; and the entire weight was recorded at that time.
Ezra 8:35 The exiles who had returned from captivity then offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering—all of these were presented as a whole burnt offering to the Lord.
Ezra 8:36 They also delivered the king’s decrees to the satraps—the provincial governors—and to the officials of the regions beyond the Euphrates River. And these officials then assisted the people and the house of God.
Ezra 9:1 After these things were completed, the leaders came to me, saying: 'The people of Israel, even the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the surrounding peoples of the lands and their detestable practices--the very practices God had forbidden. These nations include the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.'
Ezra 9:2 For they have taken wives from the daughters of these nations for themselves and for their sons, and they have mingled the holy lineage--the chosen people of God--with the surrounding peoples of the lands. The hands of the leaders and officials were the very first in this grave offense.
Ezra 9:3 When I heard this report, I tore my garments and my cloak, and I pulled out some of the hair from my head and my beard, and I sat down in deep mourning.
Ezra 9:4 Then all those who feared the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, gathered around me because of the transgression of those who had returned from the captivity. And I remained sitting in mourning until the evening sacrifice--the time of daily atonement.
Ezra 9:5 At the hour of the evening sacrifice, I rose from my deep affliction, still in my torn garment and cloak. I knelt down and spread out my hands in prayer to the Lord, my God.
Ezra 9:6 And I said: 'My God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face to You, because our iniquities have multiplied over our heads, and our transgressions have grown up to the very heavens--reaching throughout the universe.'
Ezra 9:7 From the days of our ancestors until this very day, we have been in great transgression. Because of our iniquities, we ourselves, our kings, and our priests have been handed over into the hand of the kings of the surrounding lands--delivered to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to open shame, just as it is today.
Ezra 9:8 And now, for a brief moment, a small remnant has been allowed to remain, and there is a place of safety among His holy people. Our God has enlightened our eyes and given us a small measure of relief in our bondage.
Ezra 9:9 Though we are servants, our God has not abandoned us in our servitude. Instead, He has extended His mercy to us in the sight of the king of Persia, so that He might give us new life. He has allowed us to rebuild the house of our God, to restore its desolate ruins, and to grant us a protective wall--a firm establishment--in Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra 9:10 And now, our God, what can we say after these things? For we have forsaken Your commandments,
Ezra 9:11 which You commanded through the hand of Your servants, the prophets, saying: 'The land into which you are entering to possess it is an unclean land, according to the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands and their detestable practices. They have filled it from one end to the other with their defilement.'
Ezra 9:12 And now, you shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons. You shall not seek their peace or their prosperity forever, so that you may be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and pass it on as an inheritance to your children forever.
Ezra 9:13 And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and our great transgression, since You, our God, have restrained Yourself from striking us down according to our iniquities, and have given us such salvation as we have today,
Ezra 9:14 shall we then again violate Your commandments and join ourselves with these peoples who practice these detestable things? Will You not be angry with us even to utter destruction, so that there will be no remnant left, and no salvation?
Ezra 9:15 O Lord, God of Israel, You are just! For we are left as a mere remnant, as it is this day. Behold, we are before You in our transgression--we cannot stand before You because of this.
Ezra 9:1 After these things were done, once the city had been completed, the leaders of the people came to me, Ezra, and they said: 'The people of Israel have not kept themselves separate from the surrounding peoples of the lands, nor from their abominable practices. They are intermarrying with the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.'
Ezra 9:2 For they have taken wives from among the daughters of these foreign peoples for themselves and for their sons. This means they have mingled the holy seed of God's chosen people with the peoples of these other lands. And what is worse, the leaders and the rulers were the very first to commit this grave sin.
Ezra 9:3 When I, Ezra, heard this report, I tore my outer cloak and my inner tunic, a sign of extreme anguish and grief. I pulled out hair from my head and my beard in despair, and I sat down, utterly heartbroken.
Ezra 9:4 Then all those who deeply feared the word and law of the God of Israel gathered around me, because of the great sin committed by those who had returned from exile. And I remained sitting in deep sorrow until the time of the evening sacrifice.
Ezra 9:5 At the time of the evening sacrifice, I finally rose from my posture of humiliation and intense mourning. I knelt down, and I spread out my hands in supplication to the Lord, my God.
Ezra 9:6 And I said, 'Oh my God, I am utterly ashamed and blush to even lift my face toward You, because our iniquities have multiplied so greatly that they are overwhelming us. Our offenses have grown so immense that they seem to reach up to the very sky.'
Ezra 9:7 From the days of our ancestors right up to this very day, we have been in a state of great sin. Because of our iniquities, we ourselves, along with our kings and our priests, have been handed over into the power of the kings of foreign lands. We have been subjected to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to utter shame, a condition that remains evident even today.
Ezra 9:8 And now, for what seems like a very brief and small moment, You have allowed us a remnant to survive. You have given us a secure foothold—a 'peg' in Your sanctuary, the Temple—establishing us firmly in Your holy place. Our God has enlightened our understanding, giving us hope, and has granted us a small measure of relief and refreshment in our continued servitude to foreign powers.
Ezra 9:9 For even though we are servants, in our state of servitude, our God has not abandoned us. Instead, He has shown us great mercy in the eyes of the king of Persia, so that he would grant us relief and allow us to rebuild the house of our God, and restore its desolate ruins. He has also given us a protective wall and secure boundary in Judah and Jerusalem.
Ezra 9:10 And now, O our God, what can we possibly say after all of this? For we have completely abandoned Your commandments, despite all Your mercy to us.
Ezra 9:11 These are the commandments You gave through Your servants the prophets, saying: 'The land you are entering to possess is an unclean land. It is defiled according to the impurity of the peoples of these lands. They have filled it with their abominable practices, from one end to the other, in their thorough defilement.'
Ezra 9:12 You were told: 'You shall not give your daughters to their sons in marriage, nor shall you take their daughters as wives for your sons. You shall never seek their peace or their prosperity, for you must remain separate. Do this so that you may be strong, and be able to eat the good things of the land, and pass on a secure inheritance to your sons forever.'
Ezra 9:13 And now, after all the calamities that have come upon us because of our very evil deeds and our great sin, even still, You, our God, have been merciful. You have spared us from the full punishment of our iniquity and have given us a measure of deliverance, as is evident today.
Ezra 9:14 Shall we then again transgress Your commandments and join ourselves in marriage with these abominable peoples? If we do, will You not be so angry with us that You will utterly destroy us, leaving no remnant whatsoever, preventing any of us from surviving?
Ezra 9:15 O Lord, God of Israel, You are perfectly just in all Your ways! It is only because of Your mercy that a remnant of us has been left to survive, as is evident today. Behold, we stand before You utterly condemned by our sin; indeed, we are unable to stand before You in this state of guilt.

Ezra 10:1 So, while Ezra was praying and confessing his sins, weeping and lying prostrate before God’s Temple, a very large crowd from Israel gathered around him—men, women, and children alike. And all the people wept with deep sorrow.
Ezra 10:2 Then Shechaniah, son of Jehiel, from the family of Elam, spoke to Ezra. He said: 'We have certainly sinned against our God by marrying foreign women from the surrounding nations. But even in this state, there remains hope for Israel to be restored.'
Ezra 10:3 'So let us make a solemn covenant with our God. We must send away all these foreign wives and the children born from them. This must be done according to the clear will of the Lord and the desire of those who truly reverence the commandment of our Lord God. Let it be done strictly according to God’s Law.'
Ezra 10:4 'Ezra, arise! This task is primarily yours, but we are with you to help. Be strong in the Lord, and carry out this command.'
Ezra 10:5 So Ezra stood up. He then put all the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and everyone in Israel under oath to carry out this command. And they all took the oath.
Ezra 10:6 Ezra then rose from his place before the Temple of God. He went to the living chamber of Johanan, son of Eliashib. While he stayed there, he refused to eat any bread or drink any water. He did this because he was deeply mourning the great sin committed by those who had returned from their captivity.
Ezra 10:7 A proclamation was then sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the sons of Israel. They were commanded to gather together in Jerusalem.
Ezra 10:8 It was decreed that anyone who failed to come within three days, following the counsel of the leaders and elders, would have all their possessions confiscated. Furthermore, that person would be permanently cut off from the entire community of those who had returned from captivity.
Ezra 10:9 So, within the specified three days, all the men from Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem. This was on the twentieth day of the ninth month. All the people sat in the open square before the House of God, shivering from both their sin and the heavy rains that were falling.
Ezra 10:10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and addressed them directly. He said: 'You have indeed transgressed God’s Law by marrying foreign women. By doing so, you have only added to the already great sin of Israel.'
Ezra 10:11 'Now, confess your sins truly to the Lord God of your ancestors. Do His will exactly as He commands. Separate yourselves completely from the surrounding nations and from these foreign wives.'
Ezra 10:12 Then the entire assembly responded to Ezra, shouting with one voice: 'What you have spoken to us, let it be done exactly as you say!'
Ezra 10:13 They added: 'However, there are many of us here, and it is the rainy season, so we cannot remain standing outside in these conditions. This is a task that cannot be completed in just one or two days, for many of us have committed this great sin.'
Ezra 10:14 'Let leaders be appointed from among the whole assembly. Then, let all who have married foreign women throughout our cities come forward at a set time, on a specific appointed day. They should come with the elders and judges of their respective cities. This process must continue until the fierce wrath of our God concerning this grave sin is finally turned away from us.'
Ezra 10:15 However, Jonathan, son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, son of Tikvah, openly opposed this course of action. Meshullam and Shabbethai, a Levite, actively supported their opposition.
Ezra 10:16 Despite the opposition, the sons of Israel proceeded with the plan. Ezra the priest, along with the designated heads of each family, assembled at the ancestral house. Each man was called by his name. They began to investigate this serious matter on the first day of the tenth month.
Ezra 10:17 By the first day of the first month of the new year, they had completed the investigation concerning all the men who had married foreign women.
Ezra 10:18 Among the descendants of the priests, these were found to have married foreign women: From the line of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and his brothers, these were: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
Ezra 10:19 They swore an oath, giving their hands in agreement, to send away their wives. Furthermore, as an atonement for their great sin, they committed to offering a ram from the flocks.
Ezra 10:20 From the family of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
Ezra 10:21 From the family of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.
Ezra 10:22 From the family of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
Ezra 10:23 Among the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (also known as Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
Ezra 10:24 Among the Temple singers: Eliashib. Among the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
Ezra 10:25 From the rest of Israel, specifically from the family of Parosh: Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchiah (again), and Benaiah.
Ezra 10:26 From the family of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah.
Ezra 10:27 From the family of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza.
Ezra 10:28 From the family of Bebai: Johanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
Ezra 10:29 From the family of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth.
Ezra 10:30 From the family of Pahath-Moab: Edna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh.
Ezra 10:31 From the family of Harim: Eliezer, Isshiah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, and Simeon.
Ezra 10:32 Also, Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
Ezra 10:33 From the family of Hashum: Mattanai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
Ezra 10:34 From the family of Bani: Maadai, Amram, and Uel.
Ezra 10:35 Also Benaiah, Bedeiah, and Cheluhi.
Ezra 10:36 Vaniah, Meremoth, and Eliashib.
Ezra 10:37 Mattaniah, Mattanai, and Jaasai.
Ezra 10:38 Bani, Binnui, and Shimei.
Ezra 10:39 Shelemiah, Nathan, and Adaiah.
Ezra 10:40 Machnadebai, Shashai, and Sharai.
Ezra 10:1 When all these things were taking place, Ezra was praying, confessing the sins of the people, weeping, and lying prostrate before God’s temple. A very large assembly of men, women, and children from all of Israel gathered around him, and the people wept with great and loud lamentation.
Ezra 10:2 Then Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, spoke to Ezra and said: “We have sinned greatly against our God and have taken foreign wives from the peoples of the land. But even in this, there is still hope for Israel.”
Ezra 10:3 “Therefore, let us now make a covenant with our God to send away all these wives and their children, according to the will of the Lord and of those who fear the commandments of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.”
Ezra 10:4 “Rise up, Ezra, for this task is yours, and we are with you. Be strong, and carry it out.”
Ezra 10:5 So Ezra rose up and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all the people of Israel swear an oath that they would do according to this command. And they all swore the oath.
Ezra 10:6 Then Ezra went from before the house of God and entered the chamber of Johanan, the son of Eliashib. When he went in there, he ate no bread and drank no water, for he was still mourning over the unfaithfulness of those who had returned from captivity.
Ezra 10:7 And they sent out a proclamation throughout all of Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles, calling them to gather in Jerusalem.
Ezra 10:8 Whoever did not come within three days, according to the decision of the leaders and elders, would have all his possessions confiscated, and he himself would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles.
Ezra 10:9 So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. All the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling both because of their sin and because of the heavy rain.
Ezra 10:10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them: “You have trespassed and have taken foreign wives, thus adding to the guilt of Israel.”
Ezra 10:11 “Now, therefore, give confession to the Lord, the God of your fathers, and do His will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from your foreign wives.”
Ezra 10:12 Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, saying: “As you have said to us, so let it be done!”
Ezra 10:13 “However, because there are many who have sinned in this matter, and it is the rainy season, we cannot stand outside. This work cannot be finished in just one or two days, for indeed, many of us have sinned grievously in this matter.”
Ezra 10:14 “Therefore, let our leaders be appointed for the entire assembly. Let all those in our cities who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, along with the elders and judges of each city, until the fierce wrath of our God concerning this sin is turned away from us.”
Ezra 10:15 Only Jonathan, the son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah, the son of Tikvah, opposed this plan; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them in their opposition.
Ezra 10:16 The exiles did as they had agreed. Ezra the priest and certain men, heads of ancestral households, all designated by name, went to their homes. They began their investigation on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
Ezra 10:17 By the first day of the first month, they had finished dealing with all the men who had taken foreign wives.
Ezra 10:18 Among the sons of the priests who had taken foreign wives were these: From the sons of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
Ezra 10:19 They gave their hands in solemn agreement to send away their wives, and for their guilt, they offered a ram from the flock as a sin offering.

Nehemiah 1:1 This is the account of Nehemiah, the son of Hilkiah. It happened in the month of Chislev—the ninth month of the Jewish calendar—in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign, and I was in the citadel of Susa.
Nehemiah 1:2 And Hanani, one of my brothers, came to me with some men from Judah. I questioned them about the Jews who had escaped and survived the exile, and about Jerusalem.
Nehemiah 1:3 And they said to me: 'The remaining exiles there in the province of Judah are in great distress and public shame. The wall of Jerusalem has been torn down, and its gates have been burned to ashes by fire.'
Nehemiah 1:4 As soon as I heard these words, I sat down, wept, and mourned for many days. I fasted and prayed in the presence of the God of Heaven.
Nehemiah 1:5 And I said: 'I implore You, Lord God of Heaven, O mighty, great, and awesome God, who keeps His covenant and shows mercy to those who love Him and obey His commands!'
Nehemiah 1:6 May Your ears be open and Your eyes attentive, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant, which I am praying before You today, day and night, for Your servants, the children of Israel. I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which they have committed against You—my father's household and I have also sinned.
Nehemiah 1:7 We have acted corruptly and strayed from You, for we have not kept Your commandments, Your statutes, and Your ordinances, which You commanded through Your servant Moses.
Nehemiah 1:8 Remember the word that You gave to Your servant Moses, saying: 'If you transgress, I will scatter you among the nations.
Nehemiah 1:9 But if you return to Me, and keep My commands, and do them—even if you have been carried away to the furthest reaches of the universe—from there I will gather you and bring you to the place which I have chosen, that My Name may reside there.'
Nehemiah 1:10 These are Your servants and Your people, whom You redeemed with Your great power and Your mighty hand.
Nehemiah 1:11 I implore You, Lord, incline Your ear to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to revere Your Name. Grant success to Your servant today, and grant him favor in the sight of this man—for I was the king's cupbearer.
Nehemiah 1:1 These are the historical accounts of Nehemiah, son of Helchia. This occurred in the month of Casleu, during the twentieth year of the king's reign, while I was residing in the citadel of Susa.
Nehemiah 2:1 Now it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, that the wine was placed before him. I, Nehemiah, then took the wine and gave it to the king. Before this day, I had not shown any sadness in his presence, for it was forbidden to approach the king with a sorrowful demeanor.
Nehemiah 2:2 And the king said to me, 'Why is your face sad, seeing that I see no sign of illness in you? This can only be sorrow within your heart.' And at this question, I became greatly afraid.
Nehemiah 2:3 And I said to the king, 'O king, live forever! Why should my face not show sorrow, seeing that the city where my fathers are buried—Jerusalem—lies desolate, and its gates have been consumed by fire?'
Nehemiah 2:4 And the king said to me, 'What do you wish to request?' And at that very moment, I prayed to the God of the universe.
Nehemiah 2:5 And I said to the king, 'If it seems good to the king, and if your servant finds favor in your sight, I request that you send me to Judea, to the city where my fathers are buried, so that I may rebuild it.'
Nehemiah 2:6 And the king said to me (with the queen sitting beside him), 'For what period of time will your journey be, and when will you return?' And the matter pleased the king, and he sent me. I also set a specific time for my return for him.
Nehemiah 2:7 And I said to the king, 'If it is good in the sight of the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of the region beyond the river Euphrates, so that they may grant me safe passage until I come to Judea.'
Nehemiah 2:8 'And also a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, so that he may give me timber to cover the gates of the fortress that belongs to the temple, and the walls of the city of Jerusalem, and the house into which I will enter.' And the king granted me all these things, because the good hand—the favor—of my God was upon me.
Nehemiah 2:9 So I came to the governors of the region beyond the river, and I delivered the king's letters to them. The king had also sent with me captains of the army and horsemen for protection and escort.
Nehemiah 2:10 Now when Sanaballat the Horonite and Tobias, the Ammonite official, heard of this, they were greatly displeased. They were greatly distressed that a man had come seeking the prosperity of the children of Israel.
Nehemiah 2:11 And I came to Jerusalem, and I was there for three days.
Nehemiah 2:12 Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me, and I did not tell anyone what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me, except for the animal on which I was riding.
Nehemiah 2:13 And I went out by night through the Valley Gate, and proceeded towards the Dragon's Spring, and to the Dung Gate. As I went, I carefully inspected the broken-down walls of Jerusalem and its gates that had been consumed by fire.
Nehemiah 2:14 Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool. But there was no place for the animal on which I was riding to pass through, because of the debris.
Nehemiah 2:15 So I went up by the torrent in the night, and again inspected the wall. After completing my survey, I returned and came back to the Valley Gate.
Nehemiah 2:16 And the officials of the city did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because up to that time I had not yet told the Jews, or the priests, or the nobles, or the officials, or the rest of those who were to do the work, of my intentions.
Nehemiah 2:17 Then I said to them, 'You see the deep affliction in which we are, because Jerusalem lies desolate and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, so that we may no longer be an object of shame and reproach.'
Nehemiah 2:18 And I recounted to them how the hand—the favor—of my God had been good upon me, and also the words of the king which he had spoken to me. And they said, 'Let us arise and build!' And their hands were strengthened for the good work.
Nehemiah 2:19 But when Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the Ammonite official, and Gosem the Arab heard of it, they ridiculed us and despised us, and they said, 'What is this thing that you are doing? Are you intending to rebel against the king?'
Nehemiah 2:20 And I answered them, saying, 'The God of the universe Himself will help us, and we, His servants, will build. But as for you, you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.'
Nehemiah 2:1 It happened in the month of Nisan, the first month of the Jewish calendar, in the twentieth year of the reign of King Artaxerxes. The wine was before the king, and it was my duty to take the wine and give it to him. I was not normally sad or downcast in his presence.
Nehemiah 2:2 And the king said to me, 'Why is your face so sad, seeing that I do not see you to be physically ill? This can only be a deep sadness in your heart.' And I was greatly afraid.
Nehemiah 2:3 Then I said to the king, 'May the king live forever! How could my face not be sad, given that the city—the place where my ancestors are buried—lies in ruins, and its gates have been consumed by fire?'
Nehemiah 2:4 Then the king said to me (with the queen sitting beside him), 'What is it you are requesting, then, with such a look on your face?' At that very moment, I prayed silently to the God of Heaven.
Nehemiah 2:5 And I said to the king, 'If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I request that you send me to Judea, to the city where my ancestors are buried—Jerusalem—so that I may rebuild it.'
Nehemiah 2:6 Then the king said to me (with the queen still sitting beside him), 'How long will your journey take, and when will you return?' The king was pleased with my request, and he sent me. I specified a time for my return to him.
Nehemiah 2:7 And I also said to the king, 'If it pleases the king, please provide me with letters of passage addressed to the governors of the province Beyond the River—the region west of the Euphrates—so that they will allow me to travel through their territories until I reach Judea.'
Nehemiah 2:8 And also a letter addressed to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, instructing him to provide me with timber. This wood will be used to construct the gates for the fortress connected to the Temple, for the city walls, and for the house where I will reside. The king granted all my requests, for the good hand of my God was upon me and guided him.
Nehemiah 2:9 So I traveled to the governors of the province Beyond the River and presented them with the king's letters. The king had also provided me with an escort of army officers and cavalrymen.
Nehemiah 2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about my arrival, they were deeply displeased and greatly troubled, because a man had come to seek the welfare and prosperity of the children of Israel.
Nehemiah 2:11 Finally, I arrived in Jerusalem, and I remained there for three days.
Nehemiah 2:12 Then, during the night, I arose with only a few men accompanying me. I had not told anyone what God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem. There was no pack animal with us, only the animal I myself was riding.
Nehemiah 2:13 I went out through the Valley Gate at night, proceeding towards the Dragon's Well and then to the Dung Gate. As I went, I carefully inspected the walls of Jerusalem, observing how they lay in ruins, and how its gates had been completely destroyed by fire.
Nehemiah 2:14 From there, I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool. But at that point, there was so much rubble and damage that there was no room for the animal I was riding to pass through.
Nehemiah 2:15 So I continued my inspection by ascending the valley at night, carefully examining the wall. Afterward, I returned by way of the Valley Gate.
Nehemiah 2:16 The local officials, however, did not know where I had gone or what I was doing. Indeed, I had not yet revealed anything to the Jewish people, the priests, the nobles, the other officials, or anyone else who would be involved in the work, keeping my plans secret until the proper time.
Nehemiah 2:17 Then I said to them, 'You yourselves see the terrible condition we are in: Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been completely burned down by fire. Come, let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, so that we may no longer suffer this shame and disgrace.'
Nehemiah 2:18 I also told them about the gracious hand of my God that had been upon me, and repeated the words the king had spoken to me. Immediately, they responded, 'Let us rise up and build!' And their resolve was greatly strengthened for this good work.
Nehemiah 2:19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of our plans, they mocked us and scorned us. They said, 'What is this thing you are doing? Are you actually rebelling against the king?'
Nehemiah 2:20 I answered them directly and said, 'The God of Heaven Himself will give us success! We, His servants, will rise up and build. But as for you, you have no share, no right, and no historical claim in Jerusalem.'
Nehemiah 3:1 And Eliashib, the high priest, along with his priestly brethren, began building the Sheep Gate. They consecrated this section of the wall and installed its doors, continuing to consecrate the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred, and then all the way to the Tower of Hananeel.

Nehemiah 3:33 Now it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became very angry and greatly disturbed. He then began to mock the Jews.
Nehemiah 3:34 He then spoke before his brethren and the leading men of Samaria, saying: 'What are these feeble Jews doing? Will their leaders permit them to continue? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish the work in a single day? Will they revive the stones from these heaps of burnt rubbish?'
Nehemiah 3:35 Tobiah the Ammonite, who was standing beside him, also spoke, saying: 'Even if they build, if a fox goes up on their wall, it will break down their stone wall!'
Nehemiah 3:36 Hear us, O our God, because we have become an object of contempt! Turn their scorn back upon their own heads, and deliver them into disgrace in the land of their captivity.
Nehemiah 3:37 Do not cover their iniquity, and let their sin not be blotted out from before Your sight, because they have provoked You in the presence of those who are rebuilding.
Nehemiah 3:38 So we rebuilt the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half of its intended height. For the people had a mind to work, and their hearts were fully committed to the task.
Nehemiah 3:39 Now it came to pass that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the damage to the walls of Jerusalem was being closed up, and that the breaches had begun to be repaired, they became exceedingly angry.
Nehemiah 3:40 And they all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, intending to cause confusion and disrupt the work.
Nehemiah 4:1 It happened that when Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he became extremely angry. He was deeply provoked and mocked the Jewish people.
Nehemiah 4:2 He then spoke before his brothers and the leaders of the Samaritans, saying: "What are these weak Jews doing? Will the nations leave them alone? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish the work in a single day? Will they build from the dusty stones that have been burned?"
Nehemiah 4:3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was standing next to him, and he added: "Let them build! If even a fox goes up, it will jump over their stone wall."
Nehemiah 4:4 Nehemiah prayed: "Hear us, O our God, because we have become despised. Turn their scorn back onto their own heads, and hand them over as plunder in a land of captivity—a land where they themselves are enslaved."
Nehemiah 4:5 "Do not cover their iniquity, and let their sin not be erased from Your sight, because they have deeply disturbed those who are building."
Nehemiah 4:6 So we rebuilt the wall, and the entire wall was joined up to half its original height. The people had returned their hearts and minds fully to the work.
Nehemiah 4:7 Now it came to pass that when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the extensive damage to the wall of Jerusalem was being repaired and that the broken places had begun to be closed up, they became exceedingly angry.
Nehemiah 4:8 They all gathered together with a common purpose: to come and fight against Jerusalem, intending to spread malicious rumors and cause great trouble.
Nehemiah 4:9 But we prayed to our God, and we also set up guards on the wall, day and night, against these enemies.
Nehemiah 4:10 Meanwhile, the people of Judah said among themselves: "The strength of those carrying loads is diminished. There is too much rubble, and we will not be able to finish building the wall."
Nehemiah 4:11 And our enemies said: "They will not know or understand our plan until we come right into their midst, kill them, and make the work stop completely."
Nehemiah 4:12 It also happened that the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times, from all the places where they lived, warnings that the enemies were coming to attack us.
Nehemiah 4:13 Therefore, I stationed people in the lowest parts of the area, behind the wall, at strategic intervals around it. I placed the people there with their swords, spears, and bows.
Nehemiah 4:14 And I saw their fear, so I stood up and spoke to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: "Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, Who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your homes."
Nehemiah 4:15 So it happened that when our enemies heard it had been reported to us, and that God had thwarted their evil plan, we all returned to the wall, each man to his own work.
Nehemiah 4:16 From that day onward, half of the young men among our people were doing the construction work, and the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor. The leaders were stationed behind all the house of Judah to supervise.
Nehemiah 4:17 Those who were building the wall, and those who were carrying burdens and loading them onto the wall, worked with one hand and held a sword in the other.
Nehemiah 4:18 And each of the builders wore his sword strapped to his side as he built. The trumpeter stood next to me, ready to sound the alarm.
Nehemiah 4:19 Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: "The work is extensive and spread out, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another."
Nehemiah 4:20 "Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rush to us there. Our God will fight for us."
Nehemiah 4:21 So they continued the work, and half of them held spears from the first appearance of dawn until the stars came out in the evening.
Nehemiah 4:22 At that same time, I also said to the people: "Let each man and his servant remain within Jerusalem, so that they can be our guards both day and night."
Nehemiah 4:23 As for me, my brothers, my personal servants, and the guards who were with me, we did not take off our clothes—each man only removed them for washing.
Nehemiah 5:1 Then a great outcry began among the people, and their wives joined them in raising their voices against their fellow Jewish brothers.
Nehemiah 5:2 Some of the people began to say: 'We have so many sons and daughters, and we need grain for them to eat and for us all to survive.'
Nehemiah 5:3 Other people said: 'We are being forced to pledge our fields, our vineyards, and our houses as collateral to get grain because of this severe hunger.'
Nehemiah 5:4 And yet other people were saying: 'We had to borrow money using our fields and vineyards as collateral just to pay the king's taxes.'
Nehemiah 5:5 And now, though we are of the same flesh as our brothers, and our children are just like their children, we are forced to subjugate our own sons and daughters into slavery. Some of our daughters are already serving as female slaves, and we have no way to buy them back, because other people have taken possession of our fields and our vineyards.
Nehemiah 5:6 And I became extremely angry when I heard their desperate outcry and these specific grievances.
Nehemiah 5:7 I considered the situation carefully within my own heart, and then I publicly rebuked the nobles and the officials. I asked them: 'Are each of you truly demanding excessive interest from your own brothers?' Afterwards, I called a large public assembly to confront them.
Nehemiah 5:8 I also spoke to them, saying: 'You all know that we have made every effort to buy back our Jewish brothers who were sold into slavery to foreign nations. And now, you yourselves are selling your own brothers, forcing us to buy them back again into our own community?' They remained completely silent, unable to find any words to justify themselves.
Nehemiah 5:9 Then I continued, saying: 'What you are doing is absolutely not right! Why are you not living your lives in the reverent fear of our God, so that our enemy nations do not have reason to mock and condemn us?'
Nehemiah 5:10 Even I, my brothers, and my servants have generously lent both money and much grain to these very people. Therefore, let us now all agree to stop demanding this excessive interest from them.
Nehemiah 5:11 Today, you must return to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses. Furthermore, you must also give back to them the one-hundredth part of the money, grain, wine, and oil—which represents the excessive interest you have been accustomed to demanding from them.
Nehemiah 5:12 And the nobles replied: 'We will restore everything, and we will demand nothing further from them; we will indeed do exactly as you have spoken.' So, I called for the priests and had them administer an oath, ensuring that the nobles would do precisely what I had instructed.
Nehemiah 5:13 Then, as an additional warning, I shook out the fold of my garment, and I declared: 'May God likewise shake out every man who fails to fulfill this solemn promise, stripping him of his house and all his possessions derived from his labor! May he be completely emptied and left with nothing!' The entire assembly responded with 'Amen!' and then they praised God. So, the people who had made the promise carried out what had been spoken.
Nehemiah 5:14 Now, from the very day that the king appointed me to serve as governor over the land of Judah—which spanned from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, a full twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ever took the food allowance or salary that was due to governors.
Nehemiah 5:15 However, the governors who were before me had been a severe burden to the people. They continually took from them forty shekels of silver daily, along with generous provisions of bread, wine, and money. Even their own servants were allowed to domineer over the people. But I, for my part, did not act in this way, because of my reverent fear of God.
Nehemiah 5:16 Instead, I threw myself into the work of rebuilding this wall. I did not purchase any land for myself, and all my servants were likewise engaged in the work alongside everyone else.
Nehemiah 5:17 Moreover, a hundred and fifty Jewish people and officials regularly ate at my table, in addition to those who came to us from the Gentile nations residing around our borders.
Nehemiah 5:18 Even though my daily provision included one ox, six choice sheep, and various birds were also supplied to me, along with a wide selection of wine served once each day—despite all this abundance, I did not demand the official robes or lavish clothing due to governors. This was because the burden of servitude resting upon these people was already exceedingly heavy.
Nehemiah 5:19 Remember me, O my God, for good, in consideration of all the benevolent actions I have carried out for this people.
Nehemiah 5:1 A great cry arose from the people, and even from their wives, against their own Jewish brothers.
Nehemiah 5:2 And there were some who said: "We have many sons and daughters, and we must buy wheat so that we can eat and live."
Nehemiah 5:3 And others said: "We must mortgage our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get money, so we can buy wheat because of the famine."
Nehemiah 5:4 And still others said: "We had to borrow money to pay the king's taxes, and we had to pledge our fields and our vineyards as collateral."
Nehemiah 5:5 "And now, our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers—we are all human beings, yet our children are no different from theirs. Look, we are forced to sell our sons and daughters into slavery to pay our debts. Some of our daughters are already enslaved as servants. We have nothing left, because our fields and vineyards are already taken by others to whom we owe money."
Nehemiah 5:6 I, Nehemiah, became exceedingly angry when I heard their outcry and these words.
Nehemiah 5:7 I thought about it carefully, and then I rebuked the nobles and the officials, saying to them: "You are each demanding usury—excessive interest—from your own brothers!" Then I gathered a large assembly against them, and I spoke to them further:
Nehemiah 5:8 "We, as you know, have redeemed our Jewish brothers who had been sold to the Gentiles, doing so according to our ability to pay. And now you yourselves are selling your own brothers, so that we have to buy them back again?" They were silent, having no answer to give.
Nehemiah 5:9 And I said to them: "What you are doing is not good. Why do you not walk in the fear of our God, so that you do not bring reproach upon us from our Gentile enemies?"
Nehemiah 5:10 "I myself, along with my brothers and my servants, have also lent them money and grain. Let us now release them from these debts of usury."
Nehemiah 5:11 "Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses. And also release them from the hundredth part of the money, grain, wine, and oil that you customarily demand from them as interest."
Nehemiah 5:12 And they said: "We will restore everything, and we will demand nothing from them. We will do exactly as you say." Then I called the priests and made them swear an oath that they would act according to this promise.
Nehemiah 5:13 Furthermore, I shook out the fold of my garment and said: "Thus may God shake out from his house and from his possessions every man who does not keep this promise. May he be shaken out and emptied!" And the entire assembly said: "Amen!" And they praised God. So the people did as they had promised.
Nehemiah 5:14 Now, from the day that the king commanded me to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes—a total of twelve years—neither I nor my brothers ate the food rations that were due to me as governor.
Nehemiah 5:15 In contrast, the former governors who were before me had burdened the people severely. They had taken from them bread and wine, in addition to forty shekels of silver. Moreover, even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, because I acted out of reverence for God.
Nehemiah 5:16 Instead, I dedicated myself to the work on this wall, building it with my own hands, and I did not purchase any land for myself. All my servants also worked alongside everyone else on the wall.
Nehemiah 5:17 Furthermore, one hundred and fifty men, comprising Jews and officials, along with those who came to us from the surrounding Gentile nations, regularly ate at my table.
Nehemiah 5:18 And for me, each day, one ox was prepared, along with six chosen sheep, not counting the poultry. And every ten days, wine of all kinds, and many other provisions, were supplied. Yet, despite all this, I never demanded the governor's allowance that was due to me, because the famine was pressing heavily upon the people.
Nehemiah 5:19 Remember me, my God, for good, because of all that I have done for this people.
Nehemiah 6:1 It happened that Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and our other enemies heard that I had completed rebuilding the city wall, and that there were no gaps left in it for a gate. So, Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying: 'Come, let us meet together in the villages on the plain of Ono.'
Nehemiah 6:2 They were plotting to harm me.
Nehemiah 6:3 I sent messengers back to them, saying: 'I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down. If I leave this work to meet you, it will be interrupted.'
Nehemiah 6:4 So they sent the same message to me four times, and each time I responded to them with the same answer.
Nehemiah 6:5 Then, on the fifth time, Sanballat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.
Nehemiah 6:6 It was written in the letter: 'It has been reported among the nations, and Geshem confirms it, that you and the Judeans are plotting to rebel. That is why you are rebuilding the wall, and you intend to make yourself king, according to these rumors.'
Nehemiah 6:7 'Furthermore, you have appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, saying: “There is a king in Judea!” Now, therefore, I am reporting these matters to the king. So come now, let us meet and discuss this together.'
Nehemiah 6:8 But I sent word back to him, saying: 'None of these things you are talking about are actually happening; you are simply inventing these things from your own mind.'
Nehemiah 6:9 For all of them wanted to frighten us, thinking that our hands would become weak from the work, and that we would cease our labor. Because of this, I strengthened my resolve even more.
Nehemiah 6:10 Then I went into the house of Shemaiah, son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home. He said: 'Let us go and shut ourselves inside the temple of God, and close the temple doors; for they are coming to kill you, and they will surely come at night to murder you.'
Nehemiah 6:11 But I said: 'Should a man like me flee? And who is there, a man like me, who would enter the temple to save his life? I will not go in.'
Nehemiah 6:12 Then I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken this 'prophecy' to me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
Nehemiah 6:13 They had hired him to intimidate me, to make me sin by seeking refuge in the temple, and then they would have a scandal to publicly accuse me with.
Nehemiah 6:14 Remember them, O my God, for these actions of Tobiah and Sanballat. Also remember the prophetess Noadiah and the other prophets who kept trying to frighten me.
Nehemiah 6:15 So the entire wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, which was within fifty-two days of starting the work.
Nehemiah 6:16 When all our enemies heard about it, and all the nations around us saw it, they were humbled and realized that this work had been accomplished by God Himself.
Nehemiah 6:17 Moreover, in those days, many letters from the nobles of Judah were being sent to Tobiah, and letters from Tobiah were coming to them in return.
Nehemiah 6:18 For many in Judah were bound to him by oath, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah, son of Arah. And his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah, so they were connected by family alliances.
Nehemiah 6:19 They even spoke of Tobiah's good deeds to me, and they reported my words back to him. Meanwhile, Tobiah kept sending letters to try and frighten me.
Nehemiah 7:1 After the city wall was rebuilt, I set up the doors in the gates. I then organized and registered the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites.
Nehemiah 7:2 I put my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah, the commander of the Jerusalem fortress, in charge of the city. Hananiah was a man of great integrity, who feared God more than most people.
Nehemiah 7:3 I told them: 'Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is high in the sky. And while the guards are still on duty, they are to close and bar the gates.' I also appointed guards from among the residents of Jerusalem, with each one serving in his turn and standing watch over the area directly in front of his own house.
Nehemiah 7:4 The city itself was very large and spacious, but there were few people living in it, and many houses still had not been rebuilt.
Nehemiah 7:5 Then God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the officials, and the common people so I could register them by their family lines. I found the record of the family lines of those who had returned first from exile, and this is what was written in it:
Nehemiah 7:6 These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exile, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had taken away. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his own town.
Nehemiah 7:7 Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nahum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel was as follows:
Nehemiah 7:8 The descendants of Parosh: two thousand one hundred seventy-two.
Nehemiah 7:9 The descendants of Shephatiah: three hundred seventy-two.
Nehemiah 7:10 The descendants of Arah: six hundred fifty-two.
Nehemiah 7:11 The descendants of Pahath-Moab, through the line of Jeshua and Joab: two thousand eight hundred eighteen.

Nehemiah 7:14 The descendants of Zaccai: seven hundred sixty.
Nehemiah 7:15 The descendants of Binnui: six hundred forty-eight.
Nehemiah 7:16 The descendants of Bebai: six hundred twenty-eight.
Nehemiah 7:17 The descendants of Azgad: two thousand three hundred twenty-two.

Nehemiah 7:22 The descendants of Hashum: three hundred twenty-eight.
Nehemiah 7:23 The descendants of Bezai: three hundred twenty-four.
Nehemiah 7:24 The descendants of Hariph: one hundred twelve.
Nehemiah 7:25 The descendants of Gibeon: ninety-five.
Nehemiah 7:26 The men of Bethlehem and Netophah: one hundred eighty-eight.
Nehemiah 7:27 The men of Anathoth: one hundred twenty-eight.
Nehemiah 7:28 The men of Beth-Azmaveth: forty-two.
Nehemiah 7:29 The men of Kiriath-Jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth: seven hundred forty-three.
Nehemiah 7:30 The men of Ramah and Geba: six hundred twenty-one.
Nehemiah 7:31 The men of Michmash: one hundred twenty-two.
Nehemiah 7:32 The men of Bethel and Ai: one hundred twenty-three.
Nehemiah 7:33 The men of the other Nebo: fifty-two.
Nehemiah 7:34 The descendants of the other Elam: one thousand two hundred fifty-four.
Nehemiah 7:35 The descendants of Harim: three hundred twenty.
Nehemiah 7:36 The descendants of Jericho: three hundred forty-five.
Nehemiah 7:37 The descendants of Lod, Hadid, and Ono: seven hundred twenty-one.
Nehemiah 7:38 The descendants of Senaah: three thousand nine hundred thirty.
Nehemiah 7:39 The priests: The descendants of Jedaiah, from the house of Jeshua: nine hundred seventy-three.
Nehemiah 7:40 The descendants of Immer: one thousand fifty-two.
Nehemiah 7:1 After the wall was finished, and I had set up the city gates, I then appointed the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites for their duties.
Nehemiah 7:2 I gave orders to my brother Hanani, and to Hananiah, the commander of the fortress of Jerusalem—because he was a trustworthy man, and feared God more than anyone else there.
Nehemiah 7:3 And I told them: 'Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun's full heat has arrived. While the guards are still on duty, they are to close and bar the gates tightly. Also, appoint guards from the citizens of Jerusalem, each for his own shift, and each one standing guard opposite his own house.'
Nehemiah 7:4 Now the city itself was very large and expansive, but there were few people living within it, and many houses had not yet been rebuilt. God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the officials, and the common people so I could register them. I found the register of those who had first returned from exile, and in it was written:
Nehemiah 7:5 'These are the descendants of the province who came up from the captivity, from the exile, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had carried away. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judea, each to his own city.'
Nehemiah 7:6 Those who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nahum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:
Nehemiah 7:7 The descendants of Parosh, 2,172.
Nehemiah 7:8 The descendants of Shephatiah, 372.
Nehemiah 7:9 The descendants of Arah, 652.

Nehemiah 7:12 The descendants of Zattu, 845.
Nehemiah 7:13 The descendants of Zaccai, 760.
Nehemiah 7:14 The descendants of Binnui, 648.
Nehemiah 7:15 The descendants of Bebai, 628.
Nehemiah 7:16 The descendants of Azgad, 2,322.

Nehemiah 7:24 The descendants of Gibeon, 95.
Nehemiah 7:25 The descendants of Anathoth, 128.

Nehemiah 7:37 The priests: The descendants of Jedaiah, from the house of Jeshua, 973.
Nehemiah 7:38 The descendants of Immer, 1,052.
Nehemiah 7:39 The descendants of Pashhur, 1,247.
Nehemiah 7:40 The descendants of Harim, 1,017.
Nehemiah 8:1 So all the people gathered as one, assembling in the public square that stood before the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel, for them to hear.
Nehemiah 8:2 So Ezra the priest brought the Book of the Law before the assembly, including men, women, and all the children old enough to understand. He did this on the first day of the seventh month—the beginning of the civil year.
Nehemiah 8:3 And Ezra read from the book aloud and clearly in the public square, before the Water Gate, from early morning until midday. He read in the presence of the men, women, and those children who were able to understand. The entire assembly listened with focused attention to the Book of the Law.
Nehemiah 8:4 Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform that had been built for the purpose of speaking to the assembly. Standing beside him on his right were Mattathiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah. On his left stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
Nehemiah 8:5 Ezra then opened the Book of the Law in the sight of all the people, for he was standing on the platform above everyone. As soon as he opened it, all the people rose to their feet in reverence.
Nehemiah 8:6 Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God of all. And all the people responded, 'Amen, Amen,' raising their hands in agreement and praise. Then, bowing their heads, they prostrated themselves with their faces to the ground and adored the Lord.
Nehemiah 8:7 Then the Levites—Joshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah—ensured silence among the people so they could hear the Law. And all the people remained standing attentively.
Nehemiah 8:8 They read from the Book of the Law of God, clearly explaining its meaning so the people could understand what was being read. And as they read, the people comprehended the teachings.
Nehemiah 8:9 Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, along with the Levites who were instructing the people, said to everyone: 'This day is consecrated to the Lord our God. Do not mourn, and do not weep.' For all the people were weeping as they heard the words of the Law, realizing their past transgressions.
Nehemiah 8:10 And Nehemiah said to them: 'Go, enjoy rich foods and sweet drinks, and share some with those who have nothing prepared, for this is a holy day for our Lord. Do not be sorrowful, for the joy of the Lord is our strength and our protection.'
Nehemiah 8:11 And the Levites quieted all the people, saying: 'Be silent, because this is a holy day. Do not grieve, but rejoice.'
Nehemiah 8:12 So all the people went away to eat and to drink, and to share their provisions, and to rejoice with great gladness. They did this because they had understood the words that had been taught to them from the Law of God.
Nehemiah 8:13 On the second day, the heads of the families of all the people, along with the priests and Levites, gathered with Ezra the scribe. They came so he could further explain the words of the Law to them, seeking deeper understanding.
Nehemiah 8:14 And they found it written in the Law that the Lord had commanded through Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in temporary shelters, or booths, during the solemn feast of the seventh month.
Nehemiah 8:15 And that they should proclaim and make known throughout all their cities, and especially in Jerusalem, saying: 'Go out to the hill country and bring branches of olive trees, and branches of beautiful trees, branches of myrtle, and branches of palm trees, and branches of leafy trees, so that you may make booths,' just as it is written in the Law.
Nehemiah 8:16 So the people went out and brought the branches. And they made booths for themselves, each person on the roof of his house, and in their courtyards, and in the courtyards of the house of God, and in the public square by the Water Gate, and in the square by the Gate of Ephraim.
Nehemiah 8:17 Thus, the entire congregation of those who had returned from captivity made booths and lived in them. Indeed, the children of Israel had not done so in this manner since the days of Joshua the son of Nun, until that very day. And there was exceedingly great rejoicing.
Nehemiah 8:18 Ezra also read from the Book of the Law of God each and every day, from the first day of the feast until the last. They celebrated the solemnity for seven days, and on the eighth day, there was a solemn assembly according to the prescribed ritual of the Law.
Nehemiah 8:2 So Ezra, the priest, brought the book of the Law before the great multitude of men and women and all those who could listen and understand. This happened on the first day of the seventh month.
Nehemiah 8:3 And he read from it in the public square that was in front of the Water Gate, from the early morning until midday. He read in the presence of the men and women, and those who were able to understand, and the words of the book resonated in the ears of all the people, as they listened intently.
Nehemiah 8:4 Now Ezra, the scribe, stood on a wooden platform which he had made for speaking. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, to his right. And to his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
Nehemiah 8:5 And Ezra opened the book before all the people, for he stood high above all of them. And when he opened it, all the people stood up in reverence.
Nehemiah 8:6 And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. And all the people answered, "Amen! Amen!" raising their hands in agreement. Then they bowed down and worshiped God with their faces to the ground.
Nehemiah 8:7 Furthermore, Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah, who were Levites, made the people remain silent so they would listen to the Law. And all the people remained standing in their place.
Nehemiah 8:8 And they read from the book of the Law of God, explaining it distinctly and clearly so that it could be understood. And the people understood the Law as it was being read to them.
Nehemiah 8:9 Then Nehemiah himself, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were instructing all the people, said to them, "This day is consecrated to the Lord our God. Do not mourn and do not weep, for all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the Law."
Nehemiah 8:10 And he said to them, "Go now, eat rich food and drink sweet wine, and send portions to those who have not prepared anything for themselves. For this day is holy to our Lord; do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is our strength."
Nehemiah 8:11 And the Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be silent, for this day is holy, and do not be grieved."
Nehemiah 8:12 So all the people went away to eat and drink, and to send portions, and to make great rejoicing. For they had understood the words that had been taught to them, and they were filled with joy.
Nehemiah 8:13 And on the second day, the heads of the families of all the people, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered to Ezra the scribe, so that he might interpret for them more about the words of the Law.
Nehemiah 8:14 And they found written in the Law, that the Lord had commanded through Moses for the children of Israel to dwell in booths during the solemn feast of the seventh month.
Nehemiah 8:15 And that they should proclaim and spread the word throughout all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out to the mountain, and bring branches of olive, and branches of beautiful trees, branches of myrtle, and palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, so that booths may be made, as it is written."
Nehemiah 8:16 And the people went out and brought them. And they made booths for themselves, each one on his own housetop, and in their courtyards, and in the courtyards of the house of God, and in the public square of the Water Gate, and in the public square of the Gate of Ephraim.
Nehemiah 8:17 So the entire assembly of those who had returned from captivity made booths, and they dwelt in them. For the children of Israel had not done so from the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that very day. And there was great rejoicing.
Nehemiah 8:18 And Ezra read from the volume of the Law of God each and every day, from the first day until the very last day of the feast. And they kept the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the prescribed custom.

Nehemiah 9:1 Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month, the sons of Israel gathered together, in a state of fasting, dressed in sackcloth, and with ashes sprinkled upon them.
Nehemiah 9:2 And the people of Israel separated themselves from all foreign influence and people. They then stood publicly to confess their sins, acknowledging also the grave sins of their ancestors.
Nehemiah 9:3 Then the Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bunni, and Chenani—stood and read aloud from the Book of the Law of their Lord God for a full quarter of the day. For another full quarter of the day, they engaged in solemn confession and fervent worship of their Lord God.
Nehemiah 9:4 Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, and Chenani stood on the platform designated for the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the Lord their God in prayer.
Nehemiah 9:5 And the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bunni, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—exhorted the people, saying, 'Stand up and bless the Lord your God, from everlasting to everlasting! May they bless Your glorious Name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!'
Nehemiah 9:6 You alone, O Lord, are God. You created the universe and the highest heavens, and all the celestial beings within them. You made the earth and everything upon it, the seas and everything within them. You give life to all of them, and all the celestial beings worship You.
Nehemiah 9:7 You alone are the Lord God, Who chose Abram and brought him forth from Ur of the Chaldees, and changed his name to Abraham.
Nehemiah 9:8 You found his heart faithful before You, and You made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites to his descendants. And You fulfilled Your promises, because You are just.
Nehemiah 9:9 You saw the suffering of our ancestors in Egypt, and You heard their cry for help by the Red Sea.
Nehemiah 9:10 And You performed great signs and wonders against Pharaoh, and against all his servants, and against all the people of that land, because You knew they had acted with arrogant cruelty against our people. Thus, You established Your Name as it is known even to this day.
Nehemiah 9:11 You divided the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground. But their pursuers You cast into the depths, like a stone plunged into raging waters.
Nehemiah 9:12 You were their guide by day in a pillar of cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire, to show them the way they should go.
Nehemiah 9:13 You also descended upon Mount Sinai and spoke with them from the sky. You gave them righteous judgments and a true law, along with good ceremonies and commandments.
Nehemiah 9:14 You made Your holy Sabbath known to them, and through Your servant Moses, You commanded them to obey Your precepts, Your ceremonies, and Your Law.
Nehemiah 9:15 You gave them bread from the sky in their hunger, and brought forth water from the rock for them when they were thirsty. You commanded them to go in and take possession of the land concerning which You had sworn an oath to give it to them.
Nehemiah 9:16 However, they—our ancestors—acted arrogantly and stubbornly resisted Your commands, refusing to listen to Your precepts.
Nehemiah 9:17 They refused to obey and did not remember the marvelous works You had done for them. They hardened their necks and appointed a leader to return to their bondage in Egypt, as if in defiance of You. But You are a God of pardon, gracious and merciful, patient, and full of great compassion, and You did not abandon them.
Nehemiah 9:18 Even when they made for themselves a molten calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you up out of Egypt!'—they committed great blasphemies.
Nehemiah 9:19 Yet, in Your great mercies, You did not abandon them in the desert. The pillar of cloud did not depart from them by day to lead them on the way, nor the pillar of fire by night to show them the path they should take.
Nehemiah 9:20 You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths, and You gave them water when they were thirsty.
Nehemiah 9:21 For forty years You nourished them in the desert, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell or become sore.
Nehemiah 9:22 You gave them kingdoms and peoples, and You allotted territories to them. They took possession of the land of Sihon, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, the king of Bashan.
Nehemiah 9:23 You multiplied their children like the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land about which You had told their ancestors they should enter and possess.
Nehemiah 9:24 So the children came and possessed the land. You humbled before them the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and You delivered them—their kings and the peoples of the land—into their hands, so that they could do with them as they pleased.
Nehemiah 9:25 They captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things: wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and many fruit trees. They ate, were satisfied, grew fat, and reveled in Your great abundance.
Nehemiah 9:26 But they became disobedient and provoked Your anger. They cast Your Law behind their backs and murdered Your prophets who testified against them to bring them back to You. They committed great blasphemies.
Nehemiah 9:27 Therefore, You delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who afflicted them. But in the time of their distress, they cried out to You, and You heard them from the sky. According to Your many mercies, You gave them saviors who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.
Nehemiah 9:28 But as soon as they had rest, they returned to doing evil in Your sight. So You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, and they were subjected to them. Yet, when they turned back and cried out to You, You heard from the sky and, in Your mercies, delivered them many times.
Nehemiah 9:29 You testified against them, urging them to return to Your Law. But they acted arrogantly and would not listen to Your commandments. They sinned against Your ordinances, which a person must obey to live by them. They defiantly turned their backs and stiffened their necks, refusing to listen.
Nehemiah 9:30 You bore with them for many years and testified against them by Your Spirit through the hands of Your prophets. Yet, they would not listen, so You delivered them into the hands of the peoples of the lands.
Nehemiah 9:31 Nevertheless, in Your abundant mercies, You did not utterly destroy them nor abandon them, for You are a gracious and merciful God.
Nehemiah 9:32 Now therefore, our God, great, mighty, and terrible, Who keeps covenant and mercy, do not let all the trouble that has come upon us seem insignificant in Your sight. This trouble has afflicted our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors, and all Your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until this very day.
Nehemiah 9:33 You are just in all that has come upon us, for You have acted faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.
Nehemiah 9:34 Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our ancestors did not follow Your Law. They did not pay attention to Your commandments or to Your testimonies by which You warned them.
Nehemiah 9:35 For even in their kingdoms, and despite Your great goodness that You had given them, and in the very spacious and fertile land that You had delivered before them, they did not serve You. Nor did they turn from their wicked practices.
Nehemiah 9:36 Behold, we ourselves are servants today. And in the very land You gave to our ancestors, for them to eat its fruit and enjoy its good things, we ourselves are servants.
Nehemiah 9:37 Its abundant produce now goes to the kings You have placed over us because of our sins. They dominate our bodies and our livestock according to their own will, and we are in great distress.
Nehemiah 9:38 Because of all this, we ourselves are making a firm covenant and writing it down. Our princes, our Levites, and our priests are putting their seals upon it.
Nehemiah 9:1 On the twenty-fourth day of this particular month, the children of Israel gathered together. They were engaged in fasting, dressed in sackcloth, and had ashes on their heads as a sign of repentance.
Nehemiah 9:2 And the children of Israel separated themselves from all foreign people. They stood up and publicly confessed their own sins and the wickedness that their ancestors had committed.
Nehemiah 9:3 Then they stood up, and for one quarter of the day they read from the book of the Law of the Lord their God. For another quarter of the day, they confessed their sins and worshipped the Lord their God.
Nehemiah 9:4 Then Josue, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the platform designated for the Levites. They then cried out with a loud voice to the Lord their God.
Nehemiah 9:5 And the Levites—Josue, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said: “Rise up and bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting. May they bless Your glorious Name, which is exalted above every blessing and praise!
Nehemiah 9:6 You alone are the Lord. You created the universe and all the heavens within it, with all their hosts of stars and celestial bodies. You created the earth and everything that is in it: the seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them, and the heavenly hosts worship You.
Nehemiah 9:7 You, O Lord God, are the One who chose Abram. You brought him out from the Ur of the Chaldeans, which was a place of idolatry and evil. You then changed his name to Abraham.
Nehemiah 9:8 You found his heart to be faithful before You, and You made a covenant with him. You promised to give him the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, and to his descendants. You kept Your promises because You are just.
Nehemiah 9:9 You saw the affliction of our ancestors in Egypt. You heard their cry for help by the Red Sea.
Nehemiah 9:10 You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his servants, and against all his land. For You knew that they had dealt proudly and oppressively against our ancestors. You made a name for Yourself that is still revered to this very day.
Nehemiah 9:11 You divided the sea before them, and they passed through the middle of the sea on dry ground. But their pursuers You cast into the deep, like a stone thrown into mighty waters.
Nehemiah 9:12 You led them by a pillar of cloud during the day and by a pillar of fire at night, so that You might show them the way they should go.
Nehemiah 9:13 You also descended upon Mount Sinai and spoke with them from the heavens. You gave them righteous judgments and the Law of truth, good statutes, and commandments.
Nehemiah 9:14 You made known to them Your holy Sabbath, and You commanded them precepts, statutes, and the Law through the hand of Moses, Your servant.
Nehemiah 9:15 You gave them bread from the sky during their hunger, and You brought forth water for them from the rock when they were thirsty. And You told them to go in and possess the land, which You had sworn to give them by raising Your hand.
Nehemiah 9:16 But they, our ancestors, acted proudly. They stiffened their necks in rebellion and refused to listen to Your commandments.
Nehemiah 9:17 They refused to obey and did not remember the wonderful things You had done for them. They stiffened their necks and appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt, as if through contention. But You, O God, are forgiving, gracious, and merciful. You are patient and abounding in compassion. You did not abandon them.
Nehemiah 9:18 Indeed, they even made a molten calf for themselves and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' And they committed great blasphemies.
Nehemiah 9:19 Yet, in Your abundant mercies, You did not abandon them in the desert. The pillar of cloud did not depart from them by day, guiding them on their way, nor did the pillar of fire by night, showing them the path they should take.
Nehemiah 9:20 You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths, and You gave them water when they were thirsty.
Nehemiah 9:21 For forty years You nourished them in the desert, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.
Nehemiah 9:22 You gave them kingdoms and peoples, and You allotted them territories. So they possessed the land of Sihon, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, the king of Bashan.
Nehemiah 9:23 You multiplied their children like the stars of the sky. You brought them to the land of which You had told their ancestors, so that they might go in and possess it.
Nehemiah 9:24 And the children came and possessed the land. You humbled before them the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. You delivered the Canaanites into their hand, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, so that our ancestors might do with them as they pleased.
Nehemiah 9:25 They captured fortified cities and fertile ground. They took possession of houses full of all good things, hewn cisterns, vineyards, and olive groves, and many fruit trees. They ate and were satisfied. They grew fat and abounded in Your great delicacies.
Nehemiah 9:26 Yet they provoked You to anger and turned away from You. They cast Your Law behind their backs and killed Your prophets who testified against them to bring them back to You. They committed great blasphemies.
Nehemiah 9:27 So You delivered them into the hand of their enemies, and their enemies afflicted them. But in the time of their tribulation, they cried out to You, and You heard them from the heavens. According to Your great mercies, You gave them saviors who saved them from the hand of their enemies.
Nehemiah 9:28 But when they had rest, they returned to doing evil in Your sight. So You left them in the hand of their enemies, who subjugated them. Then they turned back and cried out to You, and You heard them from the heavens. You delivered them many times through Your mercies.
Nehemiah 9:29 You earnestly warned them to bring them back to Your Law. But they acted proudly and did not listen to Your commandments. They sinned against Your judgments—those judgments by which a person lives when he keeps them. They turned a rebellious shoulder, stiffened their necks, and refused to listen.
Nehemiah 9:30 You bore with them for many years. You solemnly warned them by Your Spirit through the hand of Your prophets. Yet they did not listen, so You delivered them into the hands of the peoples of the lands around them.
Nehemiah 9:31 Nevertheless, in Your abundant mercies, You did not utterly consume them nor did You abandon them, because You are a forgiving and merciful God.
Nehemiah 9:32 Now therefore, our God, great, mighty, and awesome, You who keep covenant and mercy, do not let all the hardship that has come upon us seem insignificant in Your sight. It has come upon our kings, our princes, our priests, our prophets, our ancestors, and all Your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until this very day.
Nehemiah 9:33 You are just in all that has come upon us, for You have acted faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.
Nehemiah 9:34 Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our ancestors did not follow Your Law. They paid no attention to Your commandments or to Your warnings that You gave them.
Nehemiah 9:35 Even in their own kingdoms, and despite Your abundant goodness that You gave them, and in the very broad and rich land which You delivered before them, they did not serve You. They did not turn from their wicked practices.
Nehemiah 9:36 Behold, we ourselves are servants today. In the land that You gave to our ancestors to enjoy its fruit and its good things, we ourselves are now servants within it.
Nehemiah 9:37 Its abundant produce now goes to the kings whom You have set over us because of our sins. They rule over our bodies and our livestock according to their own will, and we are in great tribulation.
Nehemiah 9:38 Therefore, concerning all these things, we ourselves are making a solemn covenant and writing it down. Our princes, our Levites, and our priests are putting their seals upon it.
Nehemiah 9:39 Those who signed were Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah.
Nehemiah 9:40 Also Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah, Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, Harim, Baanah, Meremoth, Obadiah, Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah. These were the priests who signed the covenant.
Nehemiah 10:1 These are the ones who put their seal upon the covenant: Nehemiah, the governor (son of Hacaliah), and Zedekiah,
Nehemiah 10:2 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
Nehemiah 10:3 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,

Nehemiah 10:6 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
Nehemiah 10:7 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

Nehemiah 10:16 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
Nehemiah 10:17 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
Nehemiah 10:18 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,
Nehemiah 10:19 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
Nehemiah 10:20 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,

Nehemiah 10:25 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
Nehemiah 10:26 Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
Nehemiah 10:27 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
Nehemiah 10:28 And the rest of the people—the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants—and everyone who had separated themselves from the foreign peoples of the land to follow God's law, along with their wives, their sons, and their daughters, all who had understanding—
Nehemiah 10:29 They joined with their more prominent kinsmen, and solemnly bound themselves by a curse and an oath to walk in God's law, which He had given through His servant Moses. They swore to observe and perform all the commandments of the Lord our God, along with His judgments and His ritual practices.
Nehemiah 10:30 They also swore that they would not give their daughters in marriage to the foreign peoples of the land, nor would they take the daughters of these peoples as wives for their sons.
Nehemiah 10:31 They further agreed that if the foreign peoples of the land were to bring goods or any food for sale on the Sabbath or on any other holy day, they would not buy anything from them. They also committed to observing the Sabbath year—the seventh year—by letting the land rest, and they would forgive every debt owed to them.
Nehemiah 10:32 We also imposed ordinances upon ourselves to contribute a third of a shekel each year for the service of the house of our God.
Nehemiah 10:33 This contribution was for the showbread, for the regular grain offering, for the regular burnt offering, for the Sabbaths and new moon festivals, for all the consecrated offerings, for the firstfruits of the sanctuary, for the sin offerings to make atonement for all Israel, and for all the necessary services of the house of our God.
Nehemiah 10:34 We also cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people to determine the schedule for bringing the wood offering to the house of our God. Each ancestral house would bring its portion at appointed times each year on specified days, so that it could be burned upon the altar of the Lord our God, just as it is written in the law of Moses.
Nehemiah 10:35 And we agreed to bring the firstfruits of our land and the firstfruits of all the produce from every tree, year after year, to the house of the Lord.
Nehemiah 10:36 And we committed to bringing the firstborn of our sons and of our livestock, as it is written in the law, as well as the firstborn of our oxen and our sheep. These offerings are to be brought to the house of our God, to the priests who minister there.
Nehemiah 10:37 We also agreed to bring the firstfruits of our ground grain, our drink offerings, the fruit from every tree, the new wine, and the oil to the priests, to be stored in the storerooms of the house of our God. And we would bring a tenth of our land's produce to the Levites. The Levites themselves are to collect the tithes from all the cities where we farm.
Nehemiah 10:38 A priest, a son of Aaron, must be present with the Levites when the Levites collect the tithes. And the Levites, in turn, must bring a tenth of their collected tithes to the house of our God, to be placed in the storerooms of the treasury.
Nehemiah 10:39 For to these storerooms, the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi are to bring the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, and oil. There, the vessels of the sanctuary are to be kept, and the priests who minister, along with the singers and the gatekeepers, are to be present. In this way, we declared that we would not neglect the house of our God.
Nehemiah 11:1 The leaders of the people had already settled in Jerusalem. For the remaining population, lots were cast so that one out of every ten people would come to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine out of ten would remain in their respective towns.
Nehemiah 11:2 The people blessed all those men who willingly volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah 11:3 These are the leaders of the province who lived in Jerusalem and in the other cities of Judah, each in his own inherited land and his own town. These included Israelites, priests, Levites, the Nethinim, and the descendants of Solomon's servants.
Nehemiah 11:4 In Jerusalem, some descendants of Judah and Benjamin took up residence. From the descendants of Judah, there was Athaiah, whose lineage traced back through Azariah, Zechariah, Amariah, Shephatiah, and Mahalalel, all of the family of Perez.
Nehemiah 11:5 Also from Judah, there was Maaseiah, son of Baruch, whose line went through Col-Hozeh, Hazaiah, Adaiah, Joiarib, and Zechariah, from the family of the Shilonites.
Nehemiah 11:6 All the descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem numbered four hundred and sixty-eight strong, capable men.
Nehemiah 11:7 From the descendants of Benjamin, there was Sallu, son of Meshullam, whose ancestry included Joed, Pedaiah, Kolaiah, Maaseiah, Ithiel, and Jeshaiah.
Nehemiah 11:8 And following him were Gabbai and Sallai, totaling nine hundred and twenty-eight men from Benjamin.
Nehemiah 11:9 Joel, son of Zichri, was appointed as their overseer. And Judah, son of Senuah, held the position of second in command over the city.
Nehemiah 11:10 Now for the priests: Jedaiah, son of Joiarib, and Jachin.
Nehemiah 11:11 Seraiah, son of Hilkiah, whose line included Meshullam, Zadok, Meraiah, and Ahitub, served as the chief minister for the house of God, meaning the Temple.
Nehemiah 11:12 And their brethren, who performed the work in the Temple, numbered eight hundred and twenty-two. There was also Adaiah, son of Jeroham, whose ancestry traced through Pedaiah, Amzi, Zechariah, Pashhur, and Malchijah.
Nehemiah 11:13 And his brethren, who were the leaders of their ancestral houses, numbered two hundred and forty-two. There was also Amashsai, son of Azarel, whose lineage included Ahzai, Meshillemoth, and Immer.
Nehemiah 11:14 And his brethren, mighty and strong men, numbered one hundred and twenty-eight. Their overseer was Zabdiel, who was a son of the notable men, meaning a prominent family.
Nehemiah 11:15 Now for the Levites: Shemaiah, son of Hasshub, whose ancestry traced through Azrikam, Hashabiah, and Bunni.
Nehemiah 11:16 And Shabbethai and Jozabad were appointed as overseers of the Levites, specifically for the tasks and duties outside the Temple of God.
Nehemiah 11:17 And Mattaniah, son of Micah, whose line went through Zabdi and Asaph, was the chief leader in offering praise and giving thanks in prayer. Bakbukiah was his second in command among his brethren. There was also Abda, son of Shammua, whose lineage included Galal and Jeduthun.
Nehemiah 11:18 All the Levites who resided in the holy city totaled two hundred and eighty-four.
Nehemiah 11:19 And the gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, who were responsible for guarding the gates, numbered one hundred and seventy-two.
Nehemiah 11:20 The rest of the Israelites, including priests and Levites, remained in all the other cities of Judah, each in his own inherited land.
Nehemiah 11:21 The Nethinim, however, lived in the Ophel district. Ziha and Gishpa were prominent among the Nethinim.
Nehemiah 11:22 The chief overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi, son of Bani, whose lineage included Hashabiah, Mattaniah, and Micah. He was from the descendants of Asaph, who were the Temple singers responsible for their duties in the House of God.
Nehemiah 11:23 This arrangement was in place because there was a direct royal decree concerning them, ensuring that the Temple singers received a fixed daily provision for their work.
Nehemiah 11:24 Pethahiah, son of Meshezabel, a descendant of Zerah from the tribe of Judah, served as the king's personal representative, handling all matters concerning the people.
Nehemiah 11:25 In the villages and rural areas of their ancestral lands, some descendants of Judah lived in Kiriath-Arba and its surrounding settlements, in Dibon and its surrounding settlements, and in Kabzeel and its surrounding settlements.
Nehemiah 11:26 They also settled in Jeshua, Moladah, and Beth-Pelet.
Nehemiah 11:27 And in Hazar-Shual, and in Beersheba and its surrounding settlements.
Nehemiah 11:28 And in Ziklag, and in Mekonah and its surrounding settlements.
Nehemiah 11:29 And in Rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth.

Nehemiah 11:31 The descendants of Benjamin, however, settled in Geba, Michmash, Ai, and Bethel, along with their surrounding settlements.
Nehemiah 11:32 They also settled in Anathoth, Nob, and Anania.
Nehemiah 11:33 And in Hazor, Ramah, and Gittaim.
Nehemiah 11:34 And in Hadid, Zeboim, and Neballat.
Nehemiah 11:35 And in Lod and Ono, which was known as the Valley of Craftsmen.
Nehemiah 11:36 And concerning the Levites, some were assigned to the portions of Judah and Benjamin, to serve among them.

Nehemiah 12:6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah.
Nehemiah 12:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their brethren in the days of Joshua.
Nehemiah 12:8 The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who, along with his brothers, led the songs of thanksgiving.
Nehemiah 12:9 And Bakbukiah and Unni, their brothers, assisted them, each in his own duty.
Nehemiah 12:10 Joshua was the father of Joiakim. Joiakim was the father of Eliashib. And Eliashib was the father of Joiada.
Nehemiah 12:11 Joiada was the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua.
Nehemiah 12:12 During the time of Joiakim, these were the heads of the priestly families: for Seraiah, Meraiah; for Jeremiah, Hananiah.

Nehemiah 12:22 The Levites, during the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded as heads of families. The priests were also recorded during the reign of Darius the Persian.
Nehemiah 12:23 The sons of Levi, the heads of families, were recorded in the book of the chronicles up to the time of Jonathan, the son of Eliashib.
Nehemiah 12:24 The leading Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua, the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers, who stood opposite them in their assigned sections to offer praise and thanksgiving, according to the command of David, the man of God, keeping watch in opposing shifts.
Nehemiah 12:25 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers, guarding the storerooms at the gates.
Nehemiah 12:26 These served in the days of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
Nehemiah 12:27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they diligently sought out the Levites from all their places to bring them to Jerusalem so that they might celebrate the dedication with joy and thanksgiving, with songs accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.
Nehemiah 12:28 So the descendants of the singers gathered themselves from the countryside around Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites.
Nehemiah 12:29 They came from Beth Gilgal and from the regions of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages for themselves all around Jerusalem.
Nehemiah 12:30 The priests and Levites first purified themselves; then they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
Nehemiah 12:31 Then I made the leaders of Judah go up on the wall, and I appointed two great choirs to give thanks. One procession went to the right, along the wall, toward the Dung Gate.
Nehemiah 12:32 And behind them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah.
Nehemiah 12:33 Also Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah.
Nehemiah 12:34 And some of the sons of the priests with trumpets, including Zechariah, the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph.
Nehemiah 12:35 And his brothers: Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe walked before them.
Nehemiah 12:36 At the Fountain Gate, they continued directly forward, ascending the steps of the City of David, up the ascent of the wall above the house of David, and as far as the Water Gate on the east.
Nehemiah 12:37 The second choir of thanksgiving went in the opposite direction, and I followed it with half of the people, along the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens, and as far as the Broad Wall.
Nehemiah 12:38 They continued above the Gate of Ephraim, and above the Old Gate, and above the Fish Gate, and the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they halted at the Guard Gate.
Nehemiah 12:39 Then the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim took their positions in all the cities of Judah and in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah 12:40 And the priests and Levites rejoiced on that day, and they sang a great song, with their choir performing in all the cities of Judah and in Jerusalem.
Nehemiah 13:1 In those days, a passage was read aloud from the book of Moses for all the people to hear. It was discovered to be written in it that the Ammonites and Moabites were not permitted to enter the assembly of God, and were to be excluded forever.
Nehemiah 13:2 The reason for this prohibition was that these nations did not meet the children of Israel with bread and water when Israel was journeying through their lands. Moreover, they hired Balaam to curse Israel, but our God turned that curse into a blessing.
Nehemiah 13:3 So it came to pass that when they heard this law, they immediately separated all foreigners from among Israel.
Nehemiah 13:4 Now, before these events, Eliasib the priest, who was in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God, had become allied with Tobia.
Nehemiah 13:5 This Eliasib had prepared a large storeroom for Tobia, a place where they had previously kept the treasures, incense, vessels, the tithe of grain, wine, and oil (which were the portions for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers), and also the priestly first-fruits.
Nehemiah 13:6 During all these events, I was not in Jerusalem, because in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, the king of Babylon, I had gone to the king. After some time, I requested leave from the king to return.
Nehemiah 13:7 So I came to Jerusalem. When I arrived, I understood the great evil that Eliasib had done for Tobia, by allowing him to have a storeroom prepared in the outer court of the house of the Lord.
Nehemiah 13:8 This action seemed extremely wicked to me. So I immediately threw all of Tobia's household goods out of that storeroom.
Nehemiah 13:9 I then gave orders, and they purified the storerooms. After this, I brought back there the vessels of the house of God, along with the incense and the oil for sacred use.
Nehemiah 13:10 I also learned that the portions due to the Levites had not been given to them. Because of this, every one of the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers had fled back to his own land, unable to perform their duties.
Nehemiah 13:11 So I confronted the magistrates and rebuked them, saying, "Why have we abandoned the house of God and neglected its servants?" Then I gathered the Levites and their fellow workers and restored them to their proper stations and responsibilities.
Nehemiah 13:12 After this, all of Judah brought the tithe of grain, wine, and oil into the storerooms of the temple.
Nehemiah 13:13 We then appointed treasurers over these storerooms: Sellemian the priest, Sadoc the scribe, and Phadaia from the Levites. Alongside these, we appointed Hanan, the son of Zaccur, the son of Mathania. These men were chosen because they had proven themselves faithful, and to them was entrusted the responsibility of distributing the portions to their brothers.
Nehemiah 13:14 My God, remember me for these actions. Do not erase the merciful deeds I have performed for the house of my God and for its sacred services.
Nehemiah 13:15 In those days, I saw people in Judah pressing wine in the winepresses on the Sabbath day. Others were bringing in sheaves of grain, wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, and they were bringing them into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I sternly warned them against selling food and other goods on that holy day.
Nehemiah 13:16 Even the Tyrians who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all sorts of merchandise. They were selling these goods to the children of Judah and within Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.
Nehemiah 13:17 I therefore rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing that you are doing, by profaning the Sabbath day in such a way?"
Nehemiah 13:18 "Did not your fathers do the very same things? And because of that, our God brought all this terrible evil upon us and upon this city. Now you are adding to God's wrath against Israel by violating the Sabbath."
Nehemiah 13:19 So it came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to grow dark before the Sabbath, I ordered them to be shut. I commanded that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath had passed. I also stationed some of my own servants at the gates, so that no burden could be brought in on the Sabbath day.
Nehemiah 13:20 Once or twice, the merchants and those who sold all sorts of wares camped outside Jerusalem, waiting for the Sabbath to end.
Nehemiah 13:21 But I warned them strongly, saying, "Why do you remain camping opposite the wall? If you do this a second time, I will lay hands on you with force." From that time onward, they stopped coming to Jerusalem on the Sabbath.
Nehemiah 13:22 I also commanded the Levites to purify themselves and to come and guard the gates, so that they might keep the Sabbath day holy. For this action too, remember me, my God, and spare me according to the abundance of your mercies.
Nehemiah 13:23 In those days, I also saw Jews who had married wives from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
Nehemiah 13:24 Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of each people they were mixed with.
Nehemiah 13:25 So I confronted them, and I cursed them. I struck some of the men and pulled out their hair. I then made them swear an oath by God, promising that they would not give their daughters to the sons of these foreign women, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:
Nehemiah 13:26 "Was it not because of such practices that Solomon, the king of Israel, sinned? Among many nations, there was no king like him; he was beloved by his God, and our God made him king over all Israel. Yet even he was led into transgression by foreign women."
Nehemiah 13:27 "Are we then to hear about you doing all this great evil, committing a transgression against our God by marrying foreign women?"
Nehemiah 13:28 One of the sons of Jojada, the son of Eliasib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanaballat the Horonite. I chased this man away from me, expelling him from the community.
Nehemiah 13:29 My God, remember those who defile the priesthood and the covenant of the priests and the Levites.
Nehemiah 13:30 So I cleansed them from all foreign influence and practices. I then established the proper divisions for the priests and the Levites, appointing each one to his own ministry and duties.
Nehemiah 13:31 I also made sure that provisions were made for the offering of wood and the first-fruits, each at their appointed times. My God, remember me for good in all these things.
Tobit 1:1 Tobias was from the tribe of Naphtali and from the city of Naphtali, which is located in upper Galilee, above Asher, beyond the road that leads to the west, and to its right is the city of Sephet.
Tobit 1:2 When he was taken captive during the reign of Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, he himself, even while placed in captivity, did not abandon the way of truth and righteous living.
Tobit 1:3 So much so that everything he could acquire, he shared daily with his captive brothers who were from his own lineage.
Tobit 1:4 And even though he was the youngest of all in the tribe of Naphtali, he still did not act childishly in his deeds.
Tobit 1:5 Indeed, when everyone else went to worship the golden calves that Jeroboam, the king of Israel, had made, he alone avoided the company of all of them.
Tobit 1:6 Instead, he went to Jerusalem, to the Temple of the Lord, and there he worshipped the Lord God of Israel, faithfully bringing all of his first fruits and his tithes.
Tobit 1:7 So much so that in the third year, he would distribute the entire tithe to proselytes and to those who came as strangers.
Tobit 1:8 The boy Tobias performed these and similar actions according to the law of God.
Tobit 1:9 However, when he had gone into captivity during the reign of Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, even though he was placed in captivity, he did not turn away from God.
Tobit 1:10 Instead, he continued to distribute everything he could acquire to the other captives.
Tobit 1:11 And he did not want to eat from the food of the Gentiles.
Tobit 1:12 And because he remembered the Lord with all his heart, God gave him favor in the sight of King Shalmaneser.
Tobit 1:13 And God gave him the power to go wherever he wished, having freedom to do whatever he desired.
Tobit 1:14 Therefore, he went among all those who were in captivity, and, admonishing them on what was beneficial for their souls and bodies, he gave money to each one as much as he could afford.
Tobit 1:15 Afterward, when King Shalmaneser had died and his son Sennacherib reigned in his place, Tobias’s ways were disturbed—meaning his previous freedom to travel and help others was restricted.
Tobit 1:16 And he could not go to the Jews, the children of Israel, except by taking all his possessions with him, implying a change in his status or the law.
Tobit 1:17 But he also ensured that he would never eat from the food of the Gentiles, maintaining his ritual purity.
Tobit 1:18 In this matter too, he gave many alms to his brothers from his own lineage.
Tobit 1:19 And he gave clothing to the naked, and he gave bread to the hungry, and he gave drink to the thirsty.
Tobit 1:20 And when King Sennacherib saw him and knew all that he had done for his brothers, the children of Israel, he ordered him to be put to death.
Tobit 1:21 And he was already apprehended, and all his property was being plundered, and he himself was being led to his death. But almighty God saved him.
Tobit 1:22 And in those days, when the children of Israel had been carried away from Jerusalem and had come to Nineveh—this sets the historical context for the events of the book.
Tobit 2:1 After these events, when I had returned to my home and my good fortune was restored to me, and all tribulation had been removed from me, I prepared a great feast with much joy for the wedding of my son Tobias.
Tobit 2:2 When the time for our meal was complete, I said to my son Tobias: "Go, and bring in whoever you find among our brethren who are captives in Nineveh and who still remember the Lord. I will wait for you here."
Tobit 2:3 So Tobias went out and searched for the poor among the children of Israel. When he returned, he reported to me, saying: "Father, one of our Israelite brethren lies suffocated in the street."
Tobit 2:4 I immediately jumped up from my couch, left the meal, and did not even touch it. I went to the man, carefully removed his body from the street, and placed it in a house until the sun would set.
Tobit 2:5 Then I returned home, washed myself, and ate my meal with deep sorrow.
Tobit 2:6 I then recalled the words of the prophet Amos, just as he had spoken: "Your feast days shall be turned into mourning, and all your joys into sadness."
Tobit 2:7 I wept, and when the sun had set, I dug a grave and buried him.
Tobit 2:8 My neighbors then rebuked me, saying: "Do you not fear for your life now? For this very reason, you were already sought out for execution, and you barely escaped the death sentence! And yet, you are burying the dead again?"
Tobit 2:9 But I was terrified by their warning. I hid the body I had just buried, and restrained my true feelings, feigning indifference in public.
Tobit 2:10 And that night, after I had buried the dead man, I washed myself and went into my upper room near the wall. I lay down to sleep with my face covered because of the heat.
Tobit 2:11 I do not know if it was from a bird's nest in the wall or from somewhere else, but warm sparrow droppings fell directly onto my eyes, and I became blind.
Tobit 2:12 My son Tobias (or perhaps, a man named Tobias) brought physicians to treat me, but it did not help me. Indeed, from that time when my blindness first afflicted me, I remained alive for forty years.
Tobit 2:13 My wife Anna, however, worked day and night at the loom, and from the labor of her hands, she provided our daily sustenance.
Tobit 2:14 It happened that a blind head of a household sent a goat kid to her as payment for her labor.
Tobit 2:1 After these events, when I had returned to my home, and my wife Anna and my son Tobias were with me again, on the feast day of Pentecost—which is also called the feast of weeks—a good dinner was prepared for me, and I reclined at the table to eat.
Tobit 2:2 When I saw how much food there was, I said to my son Tobias: “Go and find any poor person from our Jewish brothers and sisters in Nineveh—someone who keeps the Lord in their heart with complete devotion—and bring that person here so they can eat with me.”
Tobit 2:3 And Tobias returned and told me, saying: “Father, one of our Jewish brothers has been murdered and is lying in the street. The king has already ordered that his body be thrown out and not buried.”
Tobit 2:4 I immediately got up and left the feast. Before I could eat anything, I carried the body from the street and placed it inside one of the houses until the sun would set.
Tobit 2:5 Then I returned home, washed myself to cleanse the ritual impurity, and ate my meal, but I was filled with great sorrow.
Tobit 2:6 I remembered the words of the prophet Amos, just as he had spoken: “Your feast days will be turned into weeping, and all your joys will become sorrow.”
Tobit 2:7 So I wept. And when the sun had finally set—marking the end of the day—I then dug a grave and buried the man.
Tobit 2:8 All my neighbors mocked me, saying: “Look, he still isn't afraid! He almost died because of this before, yet he still buries the dead.”
Tobit 2:9 That same night, after I had washed myself and gone into my courtyard, I lay down against the courtyard wall. My face was uncovered because of the heat. I didn't realize that there were sparrows on the wall above me.
Tobit 2:10 Then their warm droppings fell onto my eyes, and I became completely blind.
Tobit 2:11 I wept over this, and when I knew that the blindness would remain with me because of the sparrows' droppings, I went to doctors. But the more they applied their eye-salve to me, the more my eyes were irritated and blinded by the droppings.
Tobit 2:12 And the Lord brought suffering upon me, making the wound of my afflictions even worse. As I was now blind, my wife Anna worked day and night to support us.
Tobit 2:13 She truly worked hard, just as women typically do, by spinning wool and providing food for our family through the labor of her own hands.
Tobit 2:14 And so it happened that a young goat was given to her—a kid from the goats—which I strongly suspected she had stolen. When I—her husband, as she would have referred to me—rebuked her, she cried out: “I don't know where it came from!” And I said to her: “Even if you claim you don't know where it came from, you must return it to whomever you stole it from! It is not right for us to eat stolen things. Go and give it back to them!”
Tobit 3:1 Then Tobit, filled with sorrow, groaned deeply and began to pray with tears, saying:
Tobit 3:2 You are truly just, Lord, and all Your judgments are righteous, and all Your ways are filled with mercy, truth, and fair judgment. And now, Lord, remember me. Do not take vengeance for my own sins, nor recall the transgressions of my parents or me.
Tobit 3:3 For neither we nor our parents obeyed Your commandments. Therefore, we have been given over to plunder, to captivity, to death, to be spoken of as a tale, and to be a reproach among all the nations where You have scattered us.
Tobit 3:4 And now, Your many judgments are true, such that You have brought upon me what is deserved according to my sins and those of my parents. For we did not keep Your commands, nor did we walk in Your truth.
Tobit 3:5 And now, Lord, deal with me according to Your goodness, and command my spirit to be received in peace. For it is better for me to die than to live.
Tobit 3:6 On that same day, it happened that Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, in the city of Rages in Media, was also being tormented with insults by her father’s household servants.
Tobit 3:7 This was because she had been married to seven men, and the demon Asmodeus had killed them each before they could ever consummate their marriage with her.
Tobit 3:8 When her servants, therefore, reproached her, saying: "You are the one who kills your husbands! Look, you have already been married to seven men, and you have not helped any of them survive!"
Tobit 3:9 "Why should we suffer because of you? Go and join them. We hope never to see a son or daughter from you."
Tobit 3:10 After hearing these things, Sarah went up to the upper room of her house. For three days and three nights she neither ate nor drank.
Tobit 3:11 But she prayed, and with tears, she implored God to free her from this painful reproach.
Tobit 3:12 And when her prayer was finished, she praised the Lord, saying: "Blessed are You, Lord our God, and blessed is Your Name forever. And may all Your works bless You throughout all ages."
Tobit 3:13 And now, Lord, I turn my face to You, and to You alone do I look.
Tobit 3:14 And I implore You, that in every tribulation, when it pleases You, You would receive this spirit of mine.
Tobit 3:15 For I have heard these reproaches, and now I know that I shall never find mercy unless I die.
Tobit 3:16 I have one and only one father, and there is no hope for me in his inheritance after what has happened.
Tobit 3:17 And since I have been married to seven men, and not even one of them remains alive, death alone is left for me.
Tobit 3:1 Then Tobit let out a deep sigh, and with tears, he began to pray, saying:
Tobit 3:2 “You are just, O Lord, and all Your judgments are just, and all Your ways are mercy, and truth, and judgment. And now, O Lord, remember me, and do not take vengeance for my sins, nor recall the transgressions of my parents or me.
Tobit 3:3 Because we have not obeyed Your precepts, for this reason we have been handed over to plunder, and to captivity, and to death, and to a disgraceful story—a tale of our infamy—and to every blasphemy among all the nations where You have scattered us.
Tobit 3:4 And now, O Lord, Your judgments are severe and just, because we have not acted according to Your precepts, and we have not walked in truth before You. And now, what do You wish me to do?
Tobit 3:5 Recall my spirit, and take it, so that I may no longer be upon the earth. For it is better for me to die than to live, because I have heard reproach and have had much cause for sadness.”
Tobit 3:6 And similarly, it happened to Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, in Rages of Media. For she also was ridiculed by her own servants, because she had been given to seven men, and Asmodeus, the demon, had killed them before they could know her intimately as husband and wife.
Tobit 3:7 Therefore, when she rejected the thought of a husband and wished to strangle herself, she said: “Indeed, I have no hope left concerning men.
Tobit 3:8 Let me not be, O Lord, from the lineage of those who blaspheme You, or who despise You.”
Tobit 3:9 And she prayed to You, and said: “Blessed are You, my God, and blessed is Your name forever through all ages.
Tobit 3:10 For You have blessed humanity, so that we might do Your will in all things that exist, and in those things that were made through You, and in those that are now, and those that are to come.
Tobit 3:11 And now, O Lord, I direct my eyes to You, and I lift my face to You, that You may free me from this shame, and receive me into eternal rest.
Tobit 3:12 For You know, O Lord, that I am pure from all sexual intercourse with a man, and that I have not defiled my name.
Tobit 3:13 And You know that I have always glorified the name of my father, and the name of my brothers, and I have always invoked You, and I have never despaired of You.
Tobit 3:14 And now, O Lord, free me from this shame, and receive my spirit in peace.
Tobit 3:15 For You are the One who accepts every prayer, and You are the One who hears my prayer, and do not despise me.
Tobit 3:16 And the prayer of both was heard in the presence of the glory of the Most High God.
Tobit 3:17 And the holy angel of the Lord, Raphael, was sent on a mission to heal both of them, whose prayers ascended at the same time, to one place, into the presence of the Lord of Hosts.
Tobit 4:1 So, after all these events, when Tobias’s eye illness became very severe and could not be cured, he called his son Tobias to himself and spoke to him.
Tobit 4:2 My son, when I am dead, bury me. And honor your mother all the days of her life; do not forget the dangers she suffered for you, carrying you in her womb.
Tobit 4:3 And when she herself has also reached the end of her life, bury her next to me.
Tobit 4:4 All the days of your life, keep the Lord in your mind, and do not desire to sin or to transgress His commandments. All the days of your life, do good, and no evil will come upon you.
Tobit 4:5 For if you act in truth—that is, if you are faithful to God—your works will prosper in truth, and so will the works of all who do good.
Tobit 4:6 To everyone who works righteousness, give from your substance—that is, your possessions and wealth. And do not turn your face away from any poor person, for God Himself will not turn His face away from you if you are in need.
Tobit 4:7 According to your substance—your means—give alms. If you have much, give much willingly; if you have little, make an effort to share even that little.
Tobit 4:8 For you are storing up a good treasure for yourself for the day of need—a treasure with God that will endure.
Tobit 4:9 For almsgiving delivers from death, and it is almsgiving that purifies sins and makes one find mercy and eternal life.
Tobit 4:10 Those who give alms will receive fullness of life. But those who commit iniquity are enemies of their own soul, because their sins harm them.
Tobit 4:11 Let every injurious word be avoided by you. And do not allow any excessive feasting—that is, gluttony. Nor should you entertain any breath of pride.
Tobit 4:12 Never commit fornication, my son. Instead, take a wife from among your own kinsfolk, from the family of your parents. For if you take a foreign wife, you will be a participant in the sins of your fathers—that is, the sins of those who married outside the covenant.
Tobit 4:13 For I remember, my son, that for this reason our brothers were killed: because they abandoned the commandment of the Lord when they married foreign women. So choose a wife from your own family. Do not become arrogant in your spirit and in your words, because from such arrogance comes all ruin and disgrace.
Tobit 4:14 Whatever you would hate to have done to yourself, take care that you never do it to another person.
Tobit 4:15 Share your bread with the hungry and the thirsty, and cover the naked with your own garments.
Tobit 4:16 Every surplus that you have, give as alms. For every good work that you do will be blessed in the sight of the Most High God.
Tobit 4:17 Beware, my son, of all fornication. And above all, marry a wife from the lineage of your parents. For the children of the proud are for destruction and not for glory.
Tobit 4:18 For in the work of lies there is destruction and disgrace. But in the work of truth and glory, all who do it prosper.
Tobit 4:19 Those who observe the commandments of God prosper. But those who fall away from Him will perish.
Tobit 4:20 From all your fields, send something to the poor. And do not mock the poor, because in all things, almsgiving delivers us from death and makes us find grace with God.
Tobit 4:21 And wherever you see a wise man, hurry to him, and let the threshold of your house be worn out by his footsteps—meaning, seek his counsel often.
Tobit 4:22 Whatever counsel you may consider, take it from a wise person. And do not despise any useful counsel.
Tobit 4:23 At all times, bless God and ask Him that your ways may be directed, and that all your counsels may remain in Him—that is, aligned with His will.
Tobit 4:24 For all nations without God lack true counsel. But the Lord Himself will give them all counsel and all good things.
Tobit 4:25 And He knows that they—the nations without God—have nothing to work for good. But the Lord our God Himself, who has given them all good things, will direct them in every work, so that they may do good in all things and always give glory to the Lord.
Tobit 4:26 My son, just as I and your mother have lived in this life, so may you also live in your life.
Tobit 4:27 Do not be afraid about earthly possessions, but let the fear of God be in your heart.
Tobit 4:28 For if you do these things and observe His commandments, you will prosper at all times, and all the plans of your enemies will perish.
Tobit 4:29 And do not be afraid, my dearest son, because we are indeed poor in earthly wealth, but we are rich in the Lord. And if we always fear the Lord and act with truth, we have abundant riches—riches that truly matter.
Tobit 4:30 For just as the proud man fears for his riches, so the just man fears for his sins.
Tobit 4:31 And do not fear from any evil, but in all things be faithful to the Lord.
Tobit 4:32 For if you do these things, the memory of your father will not perish in you. For you are children of God, and just as your Father is God, so you are children of God forever and ever.
Tobit 4:33 All the days of your life, my son, do not forget the commandments of the Lord. But in every work of yours, wherever you may be, always keep God in your heart. And do not desire to sin, nor to transgress His commandments.
Tobit 4:34 At all times, bless God in every work of yours. And do not fear any evil, for just as the Lord is in the universe, so He is over the earth and all His creation, and all His creatures.
Tobit 4:35 And because we are in Him, and all things are in Him, and all of us are in Him, and all peoples are in Him, and all creatures are in Him, and all good things are in Him.
Tobit 4:36 For just as you are children of God, so also your brothers, the children of men, are children of God forever and ever. And the children of men are children of God forever and ever.
Tobit 4:37 And therefore, my son, because in all things you have the fear of God and observe His commandments, it will always be well with you, and the memory of your father will not perish in you.
Tobit 4:38 For just as I, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your relatives are children of God forever and ever, so you are a child of God forever and ever.
Tobit 4:39 And do not fear about anything, but in all things be faithful to the Lord, because He Himself is your Father forever and ever, and your mother, and all your brothers, and all your relatives are children of God forever and ever.
Tobit 4:40 And do not fear about anything, but in all things be faithful to the Lord. For He Himself is our Father forever and ever, and all His children, and all nations, and all His creatures, and all His creations, are children of God forever and ever.
Tobit 4:1 So after these events, Tobias remembered the money he had entrusted to Gabael in Rages, a city in Media.
Tobit 4:2 And he said to himself: "Look, I am about to die. Why should I not call my son Tobias so that I can tell him these things before I die?"
Tobit 4:3 And calling his son Tobias, he said to him: "My son, listen to my words, and establish them in your heart as a firm foundation."
Tobit 4:4 All the days of your life, keep God in your mind. Be careful not to sin intentionally, and never disregard the commandments of the Lord our God.
Tobit 4:5 All the days of your life, give alms. Do not turn your face away from any poor person by withholding your substance, because if you turn your face away from any poor person, God will turn His face away from you.
Tobit 4:6 Give alms according to what you possess. If you have much, give generously. If you have little, give even that little willingly.
Tobit 4:7 You will gather a good spiritual treasure for yourself for the day of need.
Tobit 4:8 Because almsgiving truly frees from the spiritual death of sin. It is what purifies sins and causes a person to find God's mercy and eternal life.
Tobit 4:9 Those who give alms will not be in a state of great penance or sorrow for their sins.
Tobit 4:10 Son, beware of all sexual immorality. And besides your own wife, never engage in any other sexual sin.
Tobit 4:11 Never allow pride to dominate your mind, your words, or your actions, for from pride, all spiritual destruction took its beginning.
Tobit 4:12 Whatever anyone does for you, pay him at once. And do not let the wages of your hired worker remain with you until the next day.
Tobit 4:13 What you hate to receive, do not do to anyone else. Do not offer drink or food from your own stores, except to the truly needy.
Tobit 4:14 And give alms from your substance, and ask God Himself that He may direct all your ways and that all your plans may endure in Him.
Tobit 4:15 Do not fear, my son, our death at the same time, for even if we have nothing, you will still have resources.
Tobit 4:16 My son, do not fear concerning our poverty. Indeed, you possess great riches if you fear God, and if you turn away from all sin, and if you do what is pleasing before Him.
Tobit 4:17 And bless God at all times, and ask Him that He may direct your ways, and that all your plans may endure in Him.
Tobit 4:18 And do not fear, my son, if we have led a poor life. We truly possess great riches if we have feared God, and have turned away from all sin, and have done what is pleasing before Him.
Tobit 4:19 Bury your father and your mother. And from those things that remain to you for your sustenance, give alms.
Tobit 4:20 And do not fear, my son, if we have led a poor life. We truly possess great riches if we have feared God, and have turned away from all sin, and have done what is pleasing before Him.
Tobit 4:21 And do not fear, my son, if we have led a poor life. We truly possess great riches if we have feared God, and have turned away from all sin, and have done what is pleasing before Him.
Tobit 5:1 Tobias answered his father, saying, "Father, I will do everything you have commanded me."
Tobit 5:2 "But how will I get that money back from Gabael when he doesn't even know about it? And I don't know the man who was entrusted with it. How can I go to him if I don't know the way?"
Tobit 5:3 Then his father answered, saying, "I have his receipt here with me. When you show him that, he will immediately return the money to you. Now go and find some trustworthy man who will go with you. He will be paid when you both return."
Tobit 5:4 Tobias went out and found a splendid young man standing there, dressed and ready, as if prepared for a journey.
Tobit 5:5 Tobias did not know that this young man was an angel of God. So he greeted him and asked, "Where are you from, good young man?"
Tobit 5:6 The young man answered, "I am one of the children of Israel." Tobias then asked him, "Do you know the way that leads to the region of Media?"
Tobit 5:7 The young man answered, "I know the way very well. I am learned in all its roads. I have often traveled to Media and stayed with our countryman Gabael, who lives in Rages of Media. It's a two-day journey from Ecbatana to Rages."
Tobit 5:8 Tobias said to him, "Please wait for me while I tell my father this news."
Tobit 5:9 Tobias went inside and told his father everything. Then his father called the young man in and said to him, "My countryman, what would you like to be paid for the journey if you go with my son?"
Tobit 5:10 The young man said, "Besides the provision of food for you and your son, you will give me two drachmas a day and whatever else is necessary for expenses. When we return, I will receive the rest of my pay as is fair."
Tobit 5:11 Tobit then said to him, "Go and journey with my son, and I will add more to what you have asked for."
Tobit 5:12 When Tobit heard this agreement, he said to the young man, "Lead my son safely and bring him back to me sound and unharmed. And may an angel of the Lord be with you on your journey."
Tobit 5:13 His mother Anna then said to Tobit, "Why was it necessary for you to send our son away? Is he not the support of our old age? He is the one who helps us in and out of the house."
Tobit 5:14 "Do not be so eager to pile up more money! Let that money be like dirt compared to our son's safety!"
Tobit 5:15 "Our poverty is enough for us. We would be rich enough if only we could see our son safe and sound."
Tobit 5:16 And Tobit said to her, "Do not be troubled, my mother. This journey will be a safe one for our son, and he will return here to you again, and you will see him."
Tobit 5:17 His mother spoke to him like this, and after that, she was silent.
Tobit 5:18 So Tobias went out on his journey with his dog, and they came to a place where there was water.
Tobit 5:19 A large fish suddenly rushed out of the water and tried to swallow him.
Tobit 5:20 Tobias cried out and said, "Lord, it will carry me off!"
Tobit 5:21 The angel said to him, "Grab the fish and pull it towards you!" When Tobias did this, he dragged the fish onto the dry land, and it thrashed about outside the water.
Tobit 5:22 And the angel said to him, "Open the fish and take out its heart, gall, and liver. Keep these for yourself. Discard the rest of the fish's internal organs by throwing them onto the ground."
Tobit 5:1 Then Tobias answered his father and said, "Father, I will do everything you have commanded me."
Tobit 5:2 "But how can I collect the money you left with Gabael? He doesn't know me, and I don't have anything that proves I'm you, like a written sign or a seal."
Tobit 5:3 Then his father answered him, "I have the signed document for it right here with me. When you show it to him, he will immediately give the money back."
Tobit 5:4 "But now, my son, find a faithful man who will go with you, so he can also receive his payment when he returns."
Tobit 5:5 Tobias went out and found a splendid young man standing there, dressed and ready, as if prepared to travel.
Tobit 5:6 Not knowing that he was an angel of God, Tobias greeted him and said, "Good young man, where are you from?"
Tobit 5:7 The young man answered, "I am from the sons of Israel." And Tobias asked him, "Do you know the way that leads to the region of Media?"
Tobit 5:8 He replied, "I know it, and I have traveled all its roads. I even stayed with our brother Gabael, who lives in Rages, a city in Media."
Tobit 5:9 Tobias then said to him, "Please wait for me while I tell these things to my father."
Tobit 5:10 So Tobias went in and announced to his father, saying, "Look, I have found a young man from the sons of Israel who is willing to come with me."
Tobit 5:11 His father replied, "Call him to me so I can learn what tribe he belongs to, and whether he is a faithful man to travel with you."
Tobit 5:12 Tobias went out and called him, saying, "Young man, my father wants to see you."
Tobit 5:13 When he came in, he greeted Tobias's father. And Tobias the elder said, "Brother, where are you from? And from what tribe and what family?"
Tobit 5:14 He answered him, "I am from the sons of Israel, and from the tribe of Naphtali."
Tobit 5:15 And Tobias the elder said to him, "Does your tribe happen to have anyone I know?"
Tobit 5:16 He replied, "One kinsman, Ananias, from my ancestors."
Tobit 5:17 And Tobias the elder said to him, "Are you perhaps the son of Ananias, my elder kinsman?"
Tobit 5:18 He said to him, "I am not." And Tobias the elder said, "I know you are from a great family, brother. But tell me, what will your payment be? And I will give it to you."
Tobit 5:19 The angel answered, "If you go with me and make the journey, perhaps your payment should be greater than you are thinking."
Tobit 5:20 But Tobias the elder said to him, "I will give you ten drachmas a day, and your food will be with me, as if you were one of my own sons."
Tobit 5:21 If, however, you return safely with me, beyond the payment I mentioned, I will give you more, as if you were my own brother.
Tobit 5:22 The angel answered him, "I will go with you, and do not be afraid. We will have a safe journey and will return to you again."
Tobit 5:23 And Tobias the elder, responding, said, "I will bless you, brother, on this journey and throughout all the days of your life."
Tobit 5:24 As Tobias was leaving his house, and his wife feared for him, his son reminded him, while on the way, to take the money that was owed to him from them.
Tobit 5:25 And Tobias the elder said, "I will do it, but I will not go without that young man, whom you do not know."
Tobit 5:26 But when she heard that he was going, she began to weep, saying, "You have sent my son, the light of my eyes, into the hands of a stranger!"
Tobit 5:27 "Even if you wanted to give me gold and much money, I could not be without my son."
Tobit 5:28 "Was it not enough for you that we are poor, and that for our comfort, we have a son?"
Tobit 5:29 "Do not add sorrow to sorrow. For what we have is nothing compared to him."
Tobit 5:30 Tobias the elder said, "You must not be troubled, sister. For the young man himself is faithful, and he will come back safely, and he will keep the money well."
Tobit 5:31 "And he will return to us quickly."
Tobit 5:32 "And this does not concern you, but me. Do not be afraid, sister."
Tobit 5:33 "Because my boy will have a faithful angel with him, and he will have a safe journey, and he will return to us."
Tobit 5:34 And so she stopped weeping.
Tobit 5:35 And Tobias went out with the young man, and his dog followed them.
Tobit 5:36 And he continued his journey.
Tobit 5:37 And when he came to the river Tigris, he stopped on its bank and washed his feet.
Tobit 5:38 And as he stood there, suddenly a large fish lunged at him and tried to swallow him.
Tobit 5:39 And the angel said to him, "Catch the fish, and hold it fast."
Tobit 5:40 And he caught the fish and dragged it onto the dry ground.
Tobit 6:1 As they traveled, they arrived at the Tigris river in the evening, and there they made their camp for the night.
Tobit 6:2 And when the young man went down to bathe, suddenly, a huge fish came out of the water to swallow him.
Tobit 6:3 Tobias was terrified by it, and he cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Sir, look! A fish is attacking me!"
Tobit 6:4 And the angel said to him, "Grab the fish, and hold on to it!" So the young man seized the fish and dragged it onto the dry land.
Tobit 6:5 And the angel told him, "Gut the fish, and keep its heart, gall, and liver for yourself, because these will be necessary for a very useful medicine."
Tobit 6:6 And so the young man did exactly as the angel had commanded him. He prepared the fish, extracted the useful parts, and then cooked and ate the rest of it.
Tobit 6:7 And as they continued their journey, they spoke together, and then they approached the region of Media.
Tobit 6:8 And Tobias asked the angel, saying, "Brother Azarias, I beg you, what kind of medicine is found in the heart, gall, and liver of this fish?"
Tobit 6:9 And he answered him, "If a demon or an evil spirit is troubling someone, the heart of the fish must be burned as incense, and all torment will cease, and the evil spirit will depart from that person forever."
Tobit 6:10 And as for the gall, a person who has white spots in their eyes should be anointed with it, and they will be cured.
Tobit 6:11 Then Tobias asked, "Where do you want us to stay?" And the angel replied, "There is a man here who is your kinsman, named Raguel, from the tribe of Rachel. He has a daughter named Sarah, and she is his only child. All of his inheritance would belong to you, because he has no other children except for his one daughter, Sarah."
Tobit 6:12 You should ask for her to be your wife, and the Lord will surely give her to you.
Tobit 6:13 And Tobias said, "I have heard, brother Azarias, that seven men married her, and they all died. But I also heard that a demon was the one who killed them."
Tobit 6:14 And now I am afraid that this might happen to me as well. Since I am the only child of my parents, I would bring their old age down to the grave with great sorrow.
Tobit 6:15 And the angel Raphael said to him, "Listen to me, and I will show you by what instruction a demon is overcome. For whoever takes a wife and rejects God, abandoning his own reason, and gives himself over to lust like a horse or a mule which has no understanding, a demon has power over such people."
Tobit 6:16 But you, when you marry her, go into your wedding chamber, and for three days, refrain from marital intimacy with her. During that time, devote yourselves to nothing else but prayers, together with her.
Tobit 6:17 But on that first night, you shall throw the fish's liver into the fire, and the demon will flee.
Tobit 6:18 And on the second night, there will be a blessing for your marriage.
Tobit 6:19 And on the third night, you will receive a blessing, so that children may be born to you both.
Tobit 6:20 But after the third night, you shall take the virgin as your wife with a profound reverence for the Lord, choosing this holy union over merely satisfying lust. And in the lineage of Abraham, you shall be blessed with children.
Tobit 6:21 And the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, brother, because she is destined to be your wife. Heed my words, and everything will turn out well for you."
Tobit 6:22 And Tobias said, "I will do exactly as you have told me."
Tobit 7:1 When Tobiah entered into the city of Rages, he came to the house of Raguel.
Tobit 7:2 Raguel welcomed him joyfully. He looked at Tobiah and said to his wife, Anna, "How much this young man resembles my relative, Tobias!"
Tobit 7:3 And after these words, Raguel swore an oath and said: "Are you not the son of my brother Tobias?"
Tobit 7:4 And Tobiah replied to him, "I am his son."
Tobit 7:5 Both men then stood up, embraced each other, and wept. Raguel wept with tears, saying, "May blessings be upon you, my son, for you are the son of a good and most excellent man."
Tobit 7:6 Raguel exclaimed, "Oh, what sorrow! Why did I not die sooner so that I could have seen you before now?" Raguel was struck with such grief that even his daughter Sarah wept.
Tobit 7:7 Raguel welcomed him with great hospitality; he slaughtered a ram from his flocks and received them with joy, celebrating their arrival.
Tobit 7:8 After Tobiah had washed and purified himself, he came in to join the feast.
Tobit 7:9 Then Tobiah said to Raphael, who was disguised as Azariah, "Brother Azariah, tell Raguel to give me his daughter Sarah to be my wife."
Tobit 7:10 Raguel heard this request and said to Tobiah, "Eat, drink, and be cheerful tonight. Indeed, there is no other man who has the right to take my daughter Sarah as his wife except you, my relative, because you are closely related to me by blood."
Tobit 7:11 Raguel then continued, "But I want to tell you the truth, my son: I have given my daughter to seven husbands, and all of them died on the very night they went in to be with her. Yet, despite this, be cheerful tonight."
Tobit 7:12 But Tobiah declared, "I will not eat or drink from this feast until you make a firm arrangement regarding what concerns me and your daughter."
Tobit 7:13 Raguel replied, "I will do it!" And he granted Tobiah the legal right to have Sarah as his wife, and he drew up the marriage contract. Only then did they begin to eat and drink together.
Tobit 7:14 Raguel then called his wife Anna and instructed her, "Prepare another chamber, and lead Sarah into it."
Tobit 7:15 Anna led Sarah into her bridal chamber, and Sarah began to weep.
Tobit 7:16 And Anna comforted her daughter, assuring her that she would be safe. Anna said to her, "Have confidence, my daughter; the Lord will grant you joy in place of this sorrow you now feel."
Tobit 7:17 After Sarah had purified herself and prayed, she sat down at the table. Raguel then began to eat and drink.
Tobit 7:1 Tobias entered Rages, a city belonging to the Medes, and Azarias—who was Raphael the Archangel in disguise—was with him.
Tobit 7:2 When they arrived at Ecbatana, they went to Raguel’s house. Raguel welcomed them with great joy.
Tobit 7:3 Raguel looked at Tobias and said to his wife, Anna, 'This young man looks so much like my cousin Tobit!'
Tobit 7:4 After much conversation, Raguel asked them, 'Where are you from, my brothers?' They answered him, 'We are descendants of Naphtali, from the people taken captive to Nineveh.'
Tobit 7:5 Raguel then asked them, 'Do you know our kinsman Tobit?' And they replied, 'We do know him.'
Tobit 7:6 While they spoke many good things about Tobit, the angel Raphael then said to Raguel, 'This Tobias, about whom you are asking, is the son of your kinsman Tobit.'
Tobit 7:7 Raguel immediately sprang forward, kissed Tobias, and began to weep. Throwing his arms around Tobias’s neck, he continued to weep over him.
Tobit 7:8 And Raguel said to him, 'May you be blessed, my son, for you are the son of a good and most excellent man.'
Tobit 7:9 Then his wife Anna and his daughter Sara also began to weep.
Tobit 7:10 After these words, Raguel ordered a ram from his flocks to be slaughtered and a feast to be prepared.
Tobit 7:11 Knowing that Sara, Raguel’s daughter, was rightly due to him as a wife according to the Law of Moses, the angel spoke to Raguel on Tobias's behalf, saying, 'I will not eat or drink here today unless you first promise to give me your daughter Sara as my wife.'
Tobit 7:12 When he heard this, Raguel could not refuse him, knowing that she was to be given to him according to the Law of Moses.
Tobit 7:13 So Raguel took the hand of his daughter Sara and gave her to Tobias as his wife. And he said, 'Behold, my daughter is betrothed to you today, my son; from this day forth and into the future, she shall be your wife. Take her into your home in peace.'
Tobit 7:14 Then he called Sara’s mother, Anna, and told her to bring a legal document so that he might write down the marriage contract for her forever, including her dowry.
Tobit 7:15 Afterward, they began the wedding feast. Raguel blessed them and then presented his daughter Sara.
Tobit 7:16 And Raguel said: 'I bless you, my daughter, and may God bless you—He who made the universe and the earth, and the sea, and the mountains, and the rivers, and all things that are in them. Above all things, may the Lord bless you.'
Tobit 7:17 And above all, may the Lord bless you and make you worthy to bear sons and grandsons for yourself.
Tobit 7:18 Then Raguel called Tobias and said to him: 'Take courage, brother, and eat and drink, and be cheerful! For it is fitting for you alone to take my daughter as your wife, and therefore, no other man can take her as a husband but you.'
Tobit 8:1 When the dinner party was finished, they brought Tobias to Sara.
Tobit 8:2 “Remember, sister,” Tobias said to her, “that we should pray to God before we approach each other, and let us ask the Lord for our health and protection.”
Tobit 8:3 Sara replied to him, “You are right, brother, that we should pray and ask the Lord for health, protection, and mercy.”
Tobit 8:4 They both went into the room and prayed earnestly together, that their health might be preserved.
Tobit 8:5 And Tobias said, “Blessed are You, God of our fathers, and blessed is Your holy and glorious name forever and ever. May the skies and all Your creation bless You.”
Tobit 8:6 “You made Adam, and gave him Eve as a helper and a support, and from them the human race came forth. You said, ‘It is not good for man to be alone; let us make him a helper like himself.’”
Tobit 8:7 “And now, O Lord, You know that I do not approach this my sister out of lust, but with the sole intention of begetting children, through whom Your name may be blessed forever and ever.”
Tobit 8:8 Sara also said, “Blessed are You, my God, and blessed is Your name forever; and may all Your creatures bless You.”
Tobit 8:9 And God heard the prayer of both of them, and He sent His angel Raphael to heal them.
Tobit 8:10 Raphael went forth and seized the demon, and bound him in the upper desert of Egypt.
Tobit 8:11 Raphael returned and said to Tobias, “Do not fear, Tobias, for God has blessed you.” Then Tobias and Sara came together as husband and wife.
Tobit 8:12 And on that very night, the demon departed from her and did not harm her.
Tobit 8:13 And Tobias remembered the Lord's command concerning chastity and prayer, and he did what had been told to him.
Tobit 8:14 And it happened after three days that Tobias and Sara rose up and saw each other, and they were no longer afraid.
Tobit 8:15 And Tobias said, “Sister, because of you, the Lord preserved our lives and delivered us from the power of the demon, and our life has now become good.”
Tobit 8:16 “Therefore, praise the Lord, and let us celebrate His name, who made us safe.”
Tobit 8:17 And it happened after these words that Tobias and Sara rose up, and they joyfully embraced each other and blessed the Lord.
Tobit 8:18 And Tobias said, “Blessed are You, O Lord our God, who blesses us in all things and saves our souls from hell.”
Tobit 8:19 “Blessed are You, who does great wonders and delivers us from death.”
Tobit 8:20 “Blessed are You, who created all things and governs all things.”
Tobit 8:21 “Blessed are You, who are in the sky and on the earth, and in all Your creatures.”
Tobit 8:1 When the wedding feast was finished, they led Sara to young Tobiah.
Tobit 8:2 And Tobiah, remembering the angel’s words, took a portion of the fish’s liver from his satchel and placed it upon burning coals.
Tobit 8:3 Then the Archangel Raphael seized the demon and bound him in the desert lands of Upper Egypt.
Tobit 8:4 But Tobiah, rising from the bed, said to her, 'Rise, Sara, and let us pray to God today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. For these first three nights, we are dedicating ourselves to the Lord. After the third night has passed, we shall consummate our marriage fully.'
Tobit 8:5 For we are the children of saints, and it is not fitting for us to unite ourselves as those pagans do, who do not know God.
Tobit 8:6 And both of them rose, and they prayed together earnestly that they might be kept safe and unharmed.
Tobit 8:7 And he prayed, saying, 'I bless You, O God of our fathers, and I bless Your holy and glorious Name unto ages of ages. May all creation, both the heavens and all Your creatures, bless You.'
Tobit 8:8 And now, O Lord, You know that it is not out of lust that I have taken this kinswoman of mine, but solely for the sake of begetting children. May Your Name be blessed through her unto ages of ages.
Tobit 8:9 And Sara also prayed, saying, 'Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, and grant that we may dwell together into old age.'
Tobit 8:10 And when dawn broke, Raguel commanded his servants to dig a grave and bury Tobiah, lest the same fate that befell the seven previous husbands should also befall him.
Tobit 8:11 So they dug and prepared a grave for him.
Tobit 8:12 But Raguel, the father-in-law, returned to his wife Edna and said to her, 'Send one of your servant-girls to see if he is dead, so that we may bury him before anyone finds out and shames us.'
Tobit 8:13 So she sent one of her servant-girls, who, upon entering the chamber, found them safe and sound, sleeping together in the same bed.
Tobit 8:14 And returning, she announced the joyful news to them. And each person blessed the God of the Jews for having preserved Tobiah.
Tobit 8:15 And Raguel praised the Lord and said, 'Blessed are You, O Lord God, with every pure blessing, so that Your holy Name may be blessed in all ages.'
Tobit 8:16 May the heavens praise You, and all Your creation, and Your two holy angels.
Tobit 8:17 May all bless You in all ages, because You have made me joyful and have not brought me sorrow.
Tobit 8:18 And I bless You because You have shown Your mercy upon my two dear and unique children.
Tobit 8:19 Grant, O Lord, that they may reach old age together without complaint.
Tobit 8:20 And may they serve You all the days of their lives, and bless You at all times.
Tobit 8:21 And then Raguel commanded a great wedding feast to be held, and they celebrated and feasted for seven days.
Tobit 9:1 Then Tobias called the angel, who had been traveling as Azariah, to him. Tobias said, 'My brother Azariah, I ask you to take servants and camels with you. Go to Rages, the city in Media, to Gabael, and give him back his bond—the record of the money we lent him—and receive the money from him.'
Tobit 9:2 And bring Gabael back with you to my wedding. For I know that my father is keeping track of the days I have been away, and if I delay even one more day, he will be very sorrowful.
Tobit 9:3 So Raphael, revealing his true identity through his actions, took the servants and camels. He set out for Rages, the city in Media, to Gabael, and returned his bond, receiving all the money from him.
Tobit 9:4 Raphael then brought Gabael with him to the wedding celebration. Gabael blessed Tobias, the young man, and his wife Sarah, and Tobias's mother.
Tobit 9:5 After the seven days of wedding festivities were completed, Raphael and Gabael returned to Tobias and Sarah.
Tobit 9:1 Then Tobias called the Angel, whom he thought was a man, to himself and said to him: "Brother Azarias, I ask you to take servants and camels with you, and go to Rages, a city of the Medes, to Gabael. Give him my bond for the money and collect it. Then, bring him back here for my wedding."
Tobit 9:2 You know that my father is counting the days, and if I am late even by a single day, he will be very sad.
Tobit 9:3 And Raphael took four of Tobias's servants and two camels with him. He traveled to Rages, the city of the Medes, and found Gabael. He gave him Tobias's bond and received all the money from him.
Tobit 9:4 Raphael also informed Gabael about everything that had happened to young Tobias. Then, he brought Gabael back with him for the wedding.
Tobit 9:5 And Gabael came to the wedding of Tobias, blessing the Lord, because God had shown great favor to Tobias.
Tobit 9:6 Now, all these things happened after seven days, and everyone celebrated the wedding with great reverence for God.
Tobit 10:1 Meanwhile, Tobias was on his journey back home. Anna, his mother, sat every day by the road from which her son had departed, waiting for him.
Tobit 10:2 With an attentive face, she would look around, hoping he might appear; and when she saw no one, she would resume her lament, uttering this cry:
Tobit 10:3 “Oh, my son! Why did we send you out, you who are the light of our eyes, the staff of our old age, the comfort of our life, the hope of our future generations?”
Tobit 10:4 Our worry for you makes our every step feel empty and useless.
Tobit 10:5 “If only we had not sent you! And if only we ourselves had died, so that we would not have to see all this sorrow we now endure.”
Tobit 10:6 And Tobit, his father, kept telling her: “Calm down, and do not be troubled, my sister. Our son is healthy; the news is good. Our kinsman who was with him on the journey is safe. They will all come home well.”
Tobit 10:7 But Anna did not cease her tears, but instead, she continually kept watching the road from which her son had departed.
Tobit 10:8 And behold, one certain day, seeing the dog coming, she stood up and exclaimed:
Tobit 10:9 “My son is coming!” And immediately going out to meet her son, she ran to him, and embraced him, and kept kissing him, saying:
Tobit 10:10 “Thank you, God, because you have returned him to me!” And immediately, his mother and his father, and all their friends, went out to meet him.
Tobit 10:11 And upon entering the house, and placing Tobias on the bed, his father said to him: “Now, my son, get ready to prepare yourself for healing.”
Tobit 10:12 And Tobias said: “From the very start, by the power of God, God has blessed me in every way; for behold, I have come, and now, God, heal me.”
Tobit 10:13 And his father embraced Tobias, and said to him: “Blessed are you, my son, at all times!”
Tobit 10:14 And Anna, his mother, said: “Since in my life I have not seen you in prosperity until now; may Almighty God now bless you!”
Tobit 10:1 While these things were happening in Ecbatana, Tobias’s father, Tobit, was anxious every day. He counted the nights and days of the time he had agreed upon for his son's return, and when that day was completed, and his son had not yet arrived,
Tobit 10:2 he kept saying: 'Is Tobias perhaps delayed? Or has Raguel kept him with him? Or perhaps Tobias has died? Or surely, he is being held back.'
Tobit 10:3 And thus he was afflicted, and began to gravely despair, saying:
Tobit 10:4 'Woe is me, my son! If only I had not sent you! The light of my eyes, which went with you, has been taken away from me.'
Tobit 10:5 His mother, Anna, also sat daily by the roadside where her son had departed, looking into the distance, hoping he might come:
Tobit 10:6 and when she saw the road deserted, she began to cry, and say:
Tobit 10:7 'Woe is me, my son! Why did we send you, the very light of our eyes? You are the support for our old age, the hope of our life, our very guidance. For when you were with us, we had everything, but since you have gone from us, we are now in poverty.'
Tobit 10:8 Moreover, Raphael said to Tobias: 'Do you not know, brother, how you left your father?'
Tobit 10:9 Did he not admonish you to honor your father and your mother?
Tobit 10:10 And now, if it pleases you, return to your father as quickly as you can. I will go ahead of you, and you will then be able to take care of him, your wife Sarah, your maidservants, and your livestock.
Tobit 10:11 And Tobias, though he was sad because he would be leaving his wife in this manner, nevertheless agreed with the angel to do so.
Tobit 10:12 And Tobias said to his wife: 'Sarah, get up, and I will go to my father; for I know that my father and my mother are anxious in their hearts.'
Tobit 10:13 And rising up, the woman, and the son, and the maidservants, and all the livestock they possessed, they departed from Ecbatana, and went on their way to his father’s house in Nineveh.
Tobit 11:1 When they reached Caserin, which is located across from Nineveh, Raphael said to Tobias, "Brother, you know how you left your father behind, don't you?"
Tobit 11:2 "If it pleases you, let us hurry on ahead of the horses and the rest of your family, so your mother, your wife, and the animals can follow."
Tobit 11:3 As they continued on their journey, Raphael said to Tobias, "Take some of the fish's gall with you, because you will certainly need it."
Tobit 11:4 So Tobias went on ahead, and his dog followed close behind him.
Tobit 11:5 Meanwhile, Anna, Tobias's mother, was sitting by the roadside on a lookout point, from which she could see far into the distance.
Tobit 11:6 As she gazed out, she saw his arrival from afar and immediately recognized her son coming towards her. Running quickly, she announced to her husband, "Look, your son is coming!"
Tobit 11:7 And Tobit, his father, leaped from his bed, stumbling with his feet, and went out onto the road, running to meet his son.
Tobit 11:8 When Tobit reached him, he embraced Tobias, as did Sarah, Tobias's wife, and Anna, his mother. Everyone was filled with joy because he had returned healthy and safe.
Tobit 11:9 Holding his son's hand, Tobit came and applied some of the fish's gall, which Tobias had brought from the small fish, onto his father's eyes.
Tobit 11:10 After approximately thirty days, Tobit opened his eyes and was able to see his son again.
Tobit 11:11 Falling upon his son's neck, Tobit wept and exclaimed, "I see you, my son, you are the light of my eyes!"
Tobit 11:12 His wife, Anna, also said, "Now that I see you, my son, I am content to die."
Tobit 11:13 Their house was filled with great joy, and they all blessed God for His mercy.
Tobit 11:14 A great feast was prepared, and the celebration lasted for seven days, during which they continued to bless the Lord.
Tobit 11:15 Then Tobit called Raphael and said to him, "Brother, command me, and I will give you half of everything we have brought back."
Tobit 11:16 Raphael replied to him, "Do not be troubled by this, for I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven holy angels who stand before God Himself."
Tobit 11:17 Tobit said to him, "What is it you have just revealed?"
Tobit 11:18 Raphael answered, "It is not for me to conceal this truth from you. For I know that all of God's blessings are truly in you."
Tobit 11:19 As they all entered the house, they blessed the Lord. A great feast was made, and Tobit rejoiced greatly.
Tobit 11:1 And Tobias left, and his dog was with him, and Raphael followed them.
Tobit 11:2 And while they were still traveling, Raphael said to Tobias: "We know that your father will regain the light of his eyes."
Tobit 11:3 "But you must do it this way: When you enter your house, immediately worship the Lord your God, and give Him thanks. Then approach your father and kiss him."
Tobit 11:4 "And immediately rub the fish's gall on his eyes, the one you brought with you. And we know that his eyes will open at once, and your father, in your joy, will see the light of the sky."
Tobit 11:5 Then the dog, who had been with them on the journey, ran ahead and overtook them with the news, and in his joy, he fawned over them, wagging his tail.
Tobit 11:6 And his blind father, Tobit, got up and began to walk, stumbling with his feet. And while he was still walking, his father-in-law took hold of him.
Tobit 11:7 And he led him in, and kissed him with tears. And his wife Anna and his daughter also kissed him. And all of them began to weep together, and to rejoice because he had come to them.
Tobit 11:8 And after they had worshipped the Lord and given Him thanks, Tobias applied the fish's gall to his father's eyes.
Tobit 11:9 And he waited for about half an hour, and a white film began to come out of his eyes.
Tobit 11:10 And Tobias took hold of the film with his hand and pulled it out of his eyes, and immediately he regained his sight.
Tobit 11:11 And Tobit himself, and his wife, and all who knew him, magnified God and said: "Blessed are You, our God, who saves, and gives life, and takes life, and brings back from the grave, and makes the dead live."
Tobit 11:12 "And now we know that Your mercy is upon Israel forever."
Tobit 11:13 And Tobit said: "Behold, I see my son, and my daughter, and your wife, and her children, and we recognize you in your joy, because the Lord has delivered you."
Tobit 11:14 And suddenly getting up, he went out to the gate and met his son.
Tobit 11:15 And he embraced him, and kissed him with tears. And he said: "Blessed are You, Lord our God, who saves, and gives life, and takes life, and brings back from the grave."
Tobit 11:16 "And now I see my son Tobias, and his wife, and their children."
Tobit 11:17 And they all entered the house together. And behold, Anna his wife came to meet him, and his daughter, and all his servants, and his handmaids.
Tobit 11:18 And as they narrated all that had happened to them, Tobit learned that the Lord had delivered his wife from danger, and his daughter.
Tobit 11:19 And all of them together magnified God and said: "Blessed are You, our God, who saves, and gives life, and takes life, and brings back from the grave, and makes the dead live."

Tobit 12:1 After these events, Tobias called the angel who was with him, who he still thought was merely a man, and said to him: “Brother Azariah, what can I give you? Or what worthy reward can I find for all the things you have done for me?”
Tobit 12:2 You were my guide, and showed me the way on my journey; you helped me in danger; you found my wife Sarah for me; you recovered the money from Gabael; and finally, you healed my father. What could I possibly give you for all of these things?
Tobit 12:3 The angel answered them and said: “I know that all of your words are true, and that you confess all of these things from your heart.”
Tobit 12:4 “Therefore, now it is time for me to reveal myself to you and to hide nothing.”
Tobit 12:5 “For when you went with your father, and buried the dead—likewise, when you washed yourself, and ate, and then left your meal, and went into the grave of the dead man without clothes, and buried him—I was sent on a mission to test you.”
Tobit 12:6 “And again, when you and Sarah prayed, I offered your prayer before the glory of the Lord.”
Tobit 12:7 “And because you were acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation would prove your worth.”
Tobit 12:8 “And now the Lord has sent me on this mission so that I might heal you and free Sarah, your wife, from the demon.”
Tobit 12:9 “For I am Raphael, the angel, one of the seven who stand before the Lord.”
Tobit 12:10 Then both of them were greatly disturbed, and they fell on their faces, and were exceedingly afraid.
Tobit 12:11 And the angel said to them: “Do not be afraid; peace be with you. For all the good things you have done, bless the Lord, and sing praises to Him.”
Tobit 12:12 “For I did not come by my own power or grace, but by the will of our God. Therefore, bless Him forever.”
Tobit 12:13 “Throughout all my days, I appeared to you. And I ate and drank with you, and as you were taking food and drink, I was present to you, but I did not eat flesh; rather, I sustained myself by spiritual vision.”
Tobit 12:14 “Now, therefore, it is time for me to return to Him who sent me on this mission. As for you, bless God and tell of all His wonderful deeds.”
Tobit 12:15 And when he had said these things, he was taken away from their sight, and they saw him no more.
Tobit 12:16 Then, prostrating themselves on the ground, they blessed God, and rising up, they recounted all His wonderful deeds, how the angel of God had appeared to them.
Tobit 12:17 And Tobias said to his father: “How much should we give him? Or what worthy honor can we bestow upon him?”
Tobit 12:18 “For if we were to give him half of all the things we brought back, it would not be nearly enough for his worth.”
Tobit 12:19 “For he brought my wife back to me safely, and recovered the money from Gabael, and healed you, and delivered me from all dangers.”
Tobit 12:20 Therefore, considering all these things, he called out to him and said to him: “Brother Azariah, take half of all the things that have been brought, and go with all good things and peace, and may the blessing of the Lord be with you.”
Tobit 12:21 And the evening and morning passed—the fifth day. —This appears to be an error in the Clementine Vulgate, copied from Genesis 1.
Tobit 12:22 So Tobias called him and said to him: “Brother Azariah, take half of all the things that have been brought, and go with all good things and peace, and may the blessing of the Lord be with you.”
Tobit 13:1 Then Tobias began to pray, saying this: 'Blessed are You, Lord, God of Israel, and blessed is Your name for all ages to come, forever and ever.'
Tobit 13:2 'For You punish, and You save; You bring down to the realm of the dead, and You bring back up from it; and no one can escape Your powerful hand.'
Tobit 13:3 'Acknowledge Him, O children of Israel, and praise Him in the sight of the non-Jewish nations.'
Tobit 13:4 'For this reason, He scattered you among the nations that do not know Him, so that you might proclaim His marvelous deeds, and make them understand that there is no other Almighty God besides Him.'
Tobit 13:5 'He certainly punished us because of our sins; and He Himself will save us because of His mercy.'
Tobit 13:6 'Therefore, see what He has done with us, and with fear and trembling, give Him thanks. Exalt the King of all ages in your every action.'
Tobit 13:7 'I, in the land where I am held captive, give Him thanks; because He has shown His majesty among a sinful people.'
Tobit 13:8 'Therefore, turn back, you sinners, and do what is right before Him, believing that He will show you His mercy.'
Tobit 13:9 'I, and my very soul, rejoice in Him.'
Tobit 13:10 'Bless Him, all His chosen ones, on days of joy, and give Him thanks.'
Tobit 13:11 'O Jerusalem, city of God, the Lord will rebuild you forever. Therefore, rejoice in your restored state and your good deeds.'
Tobit 13:12 'The righteous will give thanks to you, and they will bless your holy name.'
Tobit 13:13 'Blessed will be those who were afflicted within you, in all things; blessed are those who will boast in you above all others, and will boast about the punishments you endured.'
Tobit 13:14 'He will lift up their souls, and they will rejoice in His salvation.'
Tobit 13:15 'Blessed be the Lord in all His works, and blessed forever: So that He may rebuild your temple with joy.'
Tobit 13:16 'And in you may there be joy throughout all ages; and let all the righteous exult in you, from one age to the next.'
Tobit 13:17 'Giving praise to Your name for ever and ever; because they will be chosen in all their works.'
Tobit 13:18 'And blessed are You, great King, because in You Jerusalem, Your city, will be rebuilt in all its works, just as Isaiah spoke concerning you.'
Tobit 13:1 And Tobias began to praise the Lord by saying:
Tobit 13:2 "Blessed is the Lord, who lives forever, through all ages.
Tobit 13:3 And His Kingdom extends over all things.
Tobit 13:4 For He disciplines His people and then shows mercy. He brings souls down to the abode of the dead and then brings them back to life.
Tobit 13:5 And there is no one who can escape His hand and power.
Tobit 13:6 O children of Israel, give thanks to Him, and praise Him in the sight of all the nations.
Tobit 13:7 For this reason, He has scattered you among the nations who do not know Him: so that you may declare His wondrous works, and make them know that there is no other God except Him.
Tobit 13:8 He Himself disciplined us because of our sins, and He Himself will save us because of His mercy.
Tobit 13:9 Give thanks to the Lord and exalt the King of all ages, and you will receive salvation from Him with great joy.
Tobit 13:10 O Jerusalem, city of God, the Lord will punish you for the works of your hands,
Tobit 13:11 but then He will again have mercy on you through the works of the righteous.
Tobit 13:12 Give thanks to the Lord with goodness, and bless the King of all ages, so that His dwelling place in you may be rebuilt with joy. And may the Lord gladden all the miserable in you, and lift up all the downtrodden for generations to come.
Tobit 13:13 Be enlightened, O Jerusalem, city of God, and you will receive all gifts with goodness. And there will be joy for you for generations throughout time.
Tobit 13:14 Nations will come to you from afar, drawn by your light, bringing gifts and worshipping the Lord in you, and they will hold your land as sacred.
Tobit 13:15 All the surrounding peoples of your generations will bless you, and they will receive a great blessing.
Tobit 13:16 Rejoice and praise the names of those who have been made joyful in you. Rejoice and praise all the people who bring about peace in you.
Tobit 13:17 Blessed be the Lord, who has exalted you, and may His kingdom be in you through all ages of ages. Amen.
Tobit 13:18 Many will come from afar, dwelling in the name of the Lord God, bringing gifts with them, and offerings to the King of the universe. Generations of generations will rejoice in you, and the name of the chosen city will remain through all ages.
Tobit 13:19 Cursed are all who hate you, and blessed are all who love you for all ages.
Tobit 13:20 In all things, they will rejoice and bless you.
Tobit 14:1 So, Tobias lived out the rest of his days in joy. He continued to walk in the ways of God, filled with reverence for Him.
Tobit 14:2 When he was one hundred and twelve years old, and his son Tobias was sixty-two, he died in glory—a blessed death.
Tobit 14:3 However, he rejoiced even more at the news of Nineveh's destruction. He also lived to see the captives from Nineveh being led into Media by Ahasuerus, the King of the Persians. And Tobias blessed the Lord God for everything He had done to the disobedient and the wicked.
Tobit 14:4 And before he died, he called his son Tobias and his seven young grandsons, and he said to them: "My sons, take note of how Nineveh will be destroyed, and how the word of the Lord, which He spoke through the prophets of Israel, will be fulfilled."
Tobit 14:5 "And believe all that God has spoken through the prophets of Israel, because these things will surely come to pass, and not one word from them will fail."
Tobit 14:6 "And all our brethren, who are in the land of Israel, will be scattered throughout all the borders of their own land."
Tobit 14:7 "But just as they will be scattered, so too will they be gathered again. They will be brought back into the land of Israel."
Tobit 14:8 "And they will rebuild the Temple of God there—not as it was before, but larger and more glorious."
Tobit 14:9 "And all who are in captivity from Israel will return, and they will live in the house of the Lord."
Tobit 14:10 "And there will be no true nation there for many generations; but after these times, the city will be rebuilt, and the Temple will be even more glorious."
Tobit 14:11 "And all who had fled will return to it."
Tobit 14:12 "And all nations will turn to the Lord God of truth, and they will abandon their idols."
Tobit 14:13 "And they will bless the Lord God in all things, and they will exalt Him in every place throughout their land."
Tobit 14:14 "And they will glorify Him, and all the nations together, and every creature that is in the sky and that is on the earth will praise Him in all His works."
Tobit 14:15 "And there will be peace and salvation for all the saints. Amen."
Tobit 14:1 And so, everything Tobit had prophesied came to pass. After his sight was restored, he lived for one hundred and twelve years, and he was blessed to see his children's children, even to the fifth generation of his descendants.
Tobit 14:2 Then he went to Media, to his wife Anna, and lived with her, and grew old in peace, surrounded by his family.
Tobit 14:3 Before his death, he called his son Tobias and his six grandchildren—the sons of Tobias—and instructed them, saying:
Tobit 14:4 “My son, make haste and go to Media, for I believe the word of the Lord, which He spoke through the prophet Nahum concerning Nineveh. It will happen exactly as He said, and there will be a great destruction of that city for a time, as foretold by God.”
Tobit 14:5 “And I know that whoever from the land of Israel remains there will be scattered abroad and all will be taken captive from their good land, and they will come into Media.”
Tobit 14:6 “And again, all those who are in the land of Israel will remember God, and they will return from all their places of dispersion, and they will rebuild Jerusalem and the house of God within it, but not as it was at first, until the fullness of the times of the generation comes.”
Tobit 14:7 “And after this, all will return from their captivity, and they will rebuild Jerusalem magnificently. The house of God within it, as He spoke concerning it, will be built for all generations, a magnificent structure.”
Tobit 14:8 “And all who fear the Lord will rebuild it in all truth. They will abandon all their idols and their blasphemies, and all the peoples will bless the Lord.”
Tobit 14:9 “And all the people will confess and exalt God, His entire people, for all ages.”
Tobit 14:10 “And all who practice justice throughout the whole world in that time will bless the Lord. All who fear the Lord will exalt Him in it, all of them in truth, and remembering our sins for His mercy.”
Tobit 14:11 “And now, children, listen to your father, and serve the Lord in truth, and seek to do what is pleasing to Him.”
Tobit 14:12 “Do not seek to remain in wickedness, nor transgress His commandment.”
Tobit 14:13 “All the days of your life, my son, keep God in your mind, and be careful never to sin, nor to abandon His commandments.”
Tobit 14:14 “In all the days of your life, do good, and do not seek what is evil.”
Tobit 14:15 And Tobias lived for one hundred and seventeen years, and he saw seven of his grandchildren before he died. He passed away in glory, and all of Israel mourned him. (This chapter continues with the details of Tobias the younger.)
Judith 1:1 Arphaxad, the king of the Medes, conquered many nations. He himself built a very powerful city, which he named Ecbatana.
Judith 1:2 He built its walls with squared and cut stones. The walls were seventy cubits high—a cubit being the length from elbow to fingertip—and thirty cubits wide.
Judith 1:3 He also placed towers by its gates, each one a hundred cubits high and sixty cubits wide.
Judith 1:4 He made its gates seventy cubits high and forty cubits wide, so that his armies and his vast numbers of infantry troops could march out to battle.
Judith 1:5 In the twelfth year of his reign, King Arphaxad began to wage war against Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Assyrians. Nebuchadnezzar reigned in the great city of Nineveh. In those days, he was conquering and possessing all the upper kingdoms from Cilicia, Damascus, and Lebanon, and from Cedes, and through all the upper territories as far as the great Euphrates River.
Judith 1:6 He also ruled across the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and Adria, and in the plain of Arioch, king of the Elymaeans. Many nations of the sons of Chelod had also submitted to his rule.
Judith 1:7 Therefore, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Assyrians, sent messengers to all those who lived in Cilicia, Damascus, and Lebanon. He also sent them to those who lived in Carmel and Cedar, and to the inhabitants of Galilee in the great plain of Esdrelon.
Judith 1:8 He sent messengers to all those who were in Samaria and across the Jordan River, as far as Jerusalem. He sent them to all the land of Jesse, reaching even to the borders of Ethiopia.
Judith 1:9 To all these peoples, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Assyrians, sent his envoys.
Judith 1:10 But all of them, with one voice, refused him. They sent his envoys away empty-handed and dismissed them without honor.
Judith 1:11 Then King Nebuchadnezzar, enraged against all that land, swore by his throne and his kingdom that he would take vengeance on all those regions.
Judith 1:12 In the thirteenth year of his reign, he gathered together all those who served alone in his army and who were prepared to fight Arphaxad, for his own might.
Judith 1:13 This vast force consisted of one hundred and twenty thousand fighting infantrymen, and twelve thousand archers on horseback. He distributed them throughout his most level plains.
Judith 1:14 He fortified his troops over an abundance of waters, and he marched up to King Arphaxad in the great plain of Ragau.
Judith 1:15 King Arphaxad advanced to meet him with his infantry, his cavalry, and a very great and numerous army.
Judith 1:16 But King Nebuchadnezzar struck down Arphaxad, along with his forces and all his cavalry, and put them to flight.
Judith 1:1 In the twelfth year of King Nebuchadnezzar's reign, when he ruled the Assyrians from the great city of Nineveh, Arphaxad was king over the Medes in Ecbatana.
Judith 1:2 This King Arphaxad had built massive walls around Ecbatana using squared and carefully cut stones. Each wall section was seven feet wide, thirty cubits long (a cubit is roughly 18 inches), and sixty-six cubits high.
Judith 1:3 He also constructed gate towers that were one hundred cubits tall and sixty cubits wide at their foundation.
Judith 1:4 The actual gates themselves were seventy cubits high and forty cubits wide, specifically designed to allow powerful armies to march out and infantry to form their battle lines.
Judith 1:5 During this period, King Nebuchadnezzar waged war against King Arphaxad, utterly defeating Arphaxad's army in every engagement.
Judith 1:6 Nebuchadnezzar captured Arphaxad's cavalry, all his chariots, and his entire military force.
Judith 1:7 He then seized control of Arphaxad's territory. When Nebuchadnezzar reached Ecbatana, he completely demolished its towers and walls, reducing all its strongholds to rubble.
Judith 1:8 Nebuchadnezzar captured Arphaxad in the Ragau mountains, executed him, and then returned to Nineveh. He brought with him all the plunder from his army, including horses, chariots, and captured warriors.
Judith 1:9 Nebuchadnezzar and his entire army stayed in Nineveh for one hundred and twenty days, celebrating their victory with continuous feasting and drinking.
Judith 1:10 After these hundred and twenty days of celebration, King Nebuchadnezzar sent messengers to all the peoples living in Cilicia, Damascus, and Lebanon.
Judith 1:11 He also sent messages to the nations in Carmel, Kedar, and Gilead, as well as to all of Galilee and the great plain of Esdraelon.
Judith 1:12 The messengers were sent to everyone in Samaria, all the people living across the Jordan River up to Jerusalem, and throughout all the land of Jesse (which is Judea), extending as far as the borders of Ethiopia.
Judith 1:13 King Nebuchadnezzar sent his envoys to all these diverse peoples and regions.
Judith 1:14 However, with one accord, every single one of them defied him and refused to join him in his military campaign.
Judith 1:15 They openly scorned his authority. Consequently, his messengers returned to him empty-handed, having failed in their mission.
Judith 1:16 King Nebuchadnezzar became extremely furious with all those lands. He solemnly swore by his royal throne and his kingdom that he would exact vengeance upon all of these rebellious regions.
Judith 1:17 Therefore, in the very next year, his thirteenth year of reign, Nebuchadnezzar immediately dispatched Holofernes, the commander-in-chief of his army, leading all his military might.
Judith 1:18 He gave Holofernes strict orders to attack and conquer all the territory of Coele-Syria and its surrounding regions, specifically targeting those who had spoken proudly and defied him.
Judith 1:19 Holofernes began his campaign with a massive army: one hundred and twenty thousand infantrymen, and twelve thousand cavalry, complete with their chariots and crews.
Judith 1:20 He led his entire army, with all their horses and chariots, up into the mountainous regions. He marched through them and then deployed his forces across all the land of Gabba.
Judith 1:21 He successfully conquered all their territories, from the highest mountains down to Chaion, extending even to the borders of Ethiopia—a vast area indeed.
Judith 1:22 Holofernes then advanced against all the descendants of Ishmael and Keturah. He established his camp in the desert, extending as far as Ephron, and continued his campaign by crossing through Arabia.
Judith 1:23 He encircled all the descendants of Midian, set fire to every one of their cities, and seized all their military camps.
Judith 1:24 He arrived in the plain of Damascus during the wheat harvest. There, he burned all their crops, and systematically cut down all their trees and vineyards, devastating their land.
Judith 1:25 A profound dread of Holofernes now fell upon all the inhabitants of Cilicia, Damascus, and those who resided in Lebanon.
Judith 1:26 Holofernes then sent messengers to all the people living in Syria-Zobah and throughout all the coastal regions.
Judith 1:27 He sent them also to those residing in Phoenicia, Gaza, Ashkelon, and other coastal towns.
Judith 1:28 The messengers went to the inhabitants of Joppa and Ekron, as well as to all the people of Israel and the entire land of Jesse (Judea), extending once more to the borders of Ethiopia.
Judith 1:29 In response, everyone from these regions came out to meet Holofernes, wearing crowns on their heads and carrying olive branches—symbols of peace and surrender.
Judith 1:30 They prostrated themselves before him on the ground, showing him profound deference and homage.
Judith 1:31 They pleaded with him, saying, 'Oh great lord, our lord, take from us whatever pleases you.'
Judith 1:32 'Treat your servants as you see fit.'
Judith 1:33 'Behold, we and all our possessions are completely at your disposal.'
Judith 1:34 'All our regions, our fortresses, and our cities are laid before you.'
Judith 1:35 'Use them as you please, and as seems best to you.'
Judith 1:36 And so, in those days, all these regions and peoples found peace and agreement with Holofernes.
Judith 1:37 They all gathered together peacefully in one place to signify their submission.
Judith 1:38 After receiving their submission, Holofernes descended from their mountainous territories.
Judith 1:39 He then established his military camps throughout all their borders and lands.
Judith 1:40 And at this point, he also received the submission of all the people of Israel.
Judith 2:1 In the thirteenth year of King Nabuchodonosor's reign, on the twenty-second day of the first month, a decree was issued from the palace of Nabuchodonosor, the king of the Assyrians, concerning how he would defend himself.
Judith 2:2 And so he called together all the elders, all the generals, and all his warriors. He held a secret council with them.
Judith 2:3 And he told them that his plan was to conquer the entire known world.
Judith 2:4 Everyone living in Nineveh had heard this. They knew how Nabuchodonosor, the king of the Assyrians, had defeated Arphaxad on the great plain, and how he had then taken control of all the vast population of the Eastern lands.
Judith 2:5 They also knew how he had seized their cities and provinces, conquering them all the way to the borders of Ethiopia.
Judith 2:6 So, King Nabuchodonosor of the Assyrians sent messengers throughout all the land, to every man who dwelled within the entirety of his borders.
Judith 2:7 And he declared to them that they must prepare themselves for a war against the entire known world.
Judith 2:8 But every single one of them united to oppose him. They became enraged in his presence, and sent him away, his demands rejected and his purpose unfulfilled.
Judith 2:9 Then Nabuchodonosor, consumed by furious and immense anger, called Holofernes, the commander of his army, and said to him:
Judith 2:10 "Look, you have left my presence, and you refused to listen to my words of peace" —this is Nabuchodonosor's perspective, implying the regions didn't listen to his 'offer' of submission.
Judith 2:11 "Now, command that you gather a vast army: one hundred and twenty thousand infantry soldiers and twelve thousand cavalry."
Judith 2:12 "And then, march out against all the lands to the west, because they have disobeyed the command of my own mouth."
Judith 2:13 "And proclaim to them that they must prepare for war and send me ten thousand men from each city and province throughout all their territory."
Judith 2:14 And he commanded Holofernes to spare no one, except those who willingly offered themselves to him in servitude.
Judith 2:15 And he ordered him that all who resisted his command should be put to death.
Judith 2:16 Then Holofernes departed from the presence of his king. He called together all his elders, generals, and warriors.
Judith 2:17 And he gathered one hundred and twenty thousand chosen men, along with twelve thousand cavalry, complete with their archers.
Judith 2:18 He also took with him an countless multitude of camels, mules, and donkeys. He requisitioned many supply ships, and made sure to prepare wood and water provisions for himself and his army.
Judith 2:19 He himself marched out, and his entire army, fully equipped with cavalry, chariots, archers, catapults, and every kind of war machine.
Judith 2:20 And he traveled through every place, through every land, every region, every nation, every people, every language group, every tribe, every province, every city, and every village —this is hyperbole to emphasize the extent of his campaign.
Judith 2:21 He reached the borders of Nineveh, crossed the Euphrates River, and then traversed the entirety of Mesopotamia.
Judith 2:22 He came to the borders of Cilicia and marched through all its territories.
Judith 2:23 He then arrived at the borders of Syria and advanced through all its lands.
Judith 2:24 Next, he reached the borders of Phoenicia and passed through all its regions.
Judith 2:25 He proceeded to the borders of Palestine and advanced through all its territories.
Judith 2:26 He then reached the borders of Judea and marched through all its lands.
Judith 2:27 From there, he arrived at the borders of Idumea and passed through all its regions.
Judith 2:28 He then came to the borders of Arabia and moved through all its territories.
Judith 2:29 After that, he reached the borders of Egypt and advanced through all its lands.
Judith 2:30 He proceeded to the borders of Libya and marched through all its regions.
Judith 2:31 From there, he arrived at the borders of Ethiopia and passed through all its territories.
Judith 2:32 He then reached the borders of Persia and moved through all its lands.
Judith 2:33 Next, he came to the borders of Media and advanced through all its regions.
Judith 2:34 He proceeded to the borders of the Chaldeans and marched through all their territories.
Judith 2:35 He then reached the borders of the Assyrians and passed through all their lands.
Judith 2:36 From there, he arrived at the borders of Babylon and moved through all its regions.
Judith 2:37 Next, he came to the borders of Susiana and advanced through all its territories.
Judith 2:38 He proceeded to the borders of the Elamites and marched through all their lands.
Judith 2:39 He then reached the borders of the Parthians and passed through all their regions.
Judith 2:40 Finally, he arrived at the borders of the Indians and moved through all their territories.
Judith 2:1 It happened that when Holofernes, the chief commander of the Assyrian armies, heard this, he became extremely angry. He then planned to crush all the land—meaning, to utterly destroy all nations—just as Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Assyria, had commanded him.
Judith 2:2 He called all the high-ranking elders, and the military leaders, and the officers of his army. In their presence, he shared his plan with them.
Judith 2:3 And he said: "My heart is set. I will not spare any land. Just as Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Assyria, has spoken, so I will do."
Judith 2:4 He added, saying: "Behold, our king, Nebuchadnezzar, has commanded me to go to every land and to wipe out all those who have not submitted to him."
Judith 2:5 He continued to speak, now directly to Holofernes, as if he himself was Nebuchadnezzar: "And you, Holofernes, who are the commander of my army, go ahead, and I will lead the way for you. I will go with you, and we will not spare any people who have not submitted to me."
Judith 2:6 He added, as Nebuchadnezzar instructing Holofernes: "And you, prepare an army for yourself. Gather for yourself men from all the men who are in my army."
Judith 2:7 And Holofernes called his commanders and the officers of the army. He counted those who were prepared for the campaign.
Judith 2:8 And they assembled the army. There were one hundred thirty thousand infantrymen and twelve thousand cavalrymen, in addition to the baggage and wagons, which were in great abundance, signifying a massive force.
Judith 2:9 And Holofernes sent messengers into every region he planned to conquer. These messengers made sure that provisions like food, water, wood, straw, hay, and every kind of sustenance were prepared for his army as it advanced.
Judith 2:10 He himself marched through Cilicia, striking down all who resisted him. He advanced as far as the borders of Japheth—a region possibly referring to northern territories or descendants of Japheth. He then marched through all the sons of Ophir and Media, and he struck down all who resisted him, reaching the borders of Syria.
Judith 2:11 And Holofernes marched through Syria Sobal, and all of Mesopotamia. He struck down all who resisted him, and he arrived at the borders of Cilicia—retracing his steps to consolidate his vast territorial gains.
Judith 2:12 Holofernes then came into Idumaea, and into Moab, and into the land of the sons of Ammon. He captured them, and he devastated their cities. He passed through all the land, striking down all who resisted him, and he reached as far as the borders of the Arab regions.
Judith 2:13 Holofernes came into Upper Galilee and into all the land of Canaan. He struck down all who resisted him, and he seized all their territories, and he established his forces there.
Judith 2:14 Holofernes then came into the plain of Esdraelon, near Dothan, and he established his forces there—positioning himself strategically in the heart of the land.
Judith 2:15 Holofernes came into all the mountainous regions. He passed through every land, striking down all who resisted him, and reached as far as the borders of Samaria.
Judith 2:16 Holofernes then came into all the land beyond the Jordan River. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—continuing his relentless expansion.
Judith 2:17 Holofernes also came into all the land beyond Lebanon. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—further extending his dominion.
Judith 2:18 Holofernes then came into all the coastal land. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there.
Judith 2:19 Holofernes also came into all the land of the Philistines. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his campaign of domination continued without pause.
Judith 2:20 And Holofernes came into all the desert land. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—leaving no region unconquered.
Judith 2:21 And Holofernes came into all the land of Egypt. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—demonstrating his overwhelming power.
Judith 2:22 And Holofernes came into all the land of Ethiopia. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his reach now extending far and wide.
Judith 2:23 And Holofernes came into all the land of Libya. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his campaign was total.
Judith 2:24 Holofernes then came into all the coastal land again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—reinforcing his grip on these crucial areas.
Judith 2:25 Holofernes also came into all the land of the Philistines again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—confirming his complete conquest.
Judith 2:26 And Holofernes came into all the desert land again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—leaving no part untouched by his devastation.
Judith 2:27 And Holofernes came into all the land of Egypt again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his control was absolute.
Judith 2:28 And Holofernes came into all the land of Ethiopia again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his dominion was firmly established.
Judith 2:29 And Holofernes came into all the land of Libya again. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his destructive path knew no bounds.
Judith 2:30 Holofernes then came into all the coastal land a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—the cycle of conquest and re-conquest continued relentlessly.
Judith 2:31 Holofernes also came into all the land of the Philistines a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his command was repeatedly enforced.
Judith 2:32 And Holofernes came into all the desert land a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his army was an omnipresent threat.

Judith 2:35 And Holofernes came into all the land of Libya a third time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—leaving no doubt about his absolute power.
Judith 2:36 Holofernes then came into all the coastal land a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his relentless campaign of subjugation continued.
Judith 2:37 Holofernes also came into all the land of the Philistines a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his domination was total and unyielding.
Judith 2:38 And Holofernes came into all the desert land a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his presence was felt in every corner of the conquered lands.
Judith 2:39 And Holofernes came into all the land of Egypt a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his control over the region was absolute and continually reinforced.
Judith 2:40 And Holofernes came into all the land of Ethiopia a fourth time. He struck down all who resisted him, and seized all their territories, and established his forces there—his empire was now stretched across a vast and diverse set of regions, all subjected to his will.
Judith 3:1 And the children of Israel, who lived in the land of Judea, heard everything that Holofernes had done to the rulers of the nations. They heard how he had plundered all their regions and laid waste to all their territories.
Judith 3:2 So they feared him greatly, and they also feared the immense power of his army. It was an exceedingly vast army, prepared to consume and conquer all the land.
Judith 3:3 They were deeply troubled and trembled with fear before him.
Judith 3:4 They secured all the borders of their land. They occupied all the high mountains and fortified places, and they set up defenses within them.
Judith 3:5 They ritually purified their clothing and put on sackcloth as a sign of mourning. They threw themselves face down on the ground all around God's Temple. They cried out loudly, weeping that Holofernes would kill those serving around the altar and seize their Holy Temple.
Judith 3:6 And they sent messengers to every border of Israel, telling them to prepare their cities to face Holofernes and to gather together in every stronghold.
Judith 3:7 And all of Israel gathered together with one accord, intending to protect their own lives, as well as the lives of their wives, their children, their livestock, and all their animals.
Judith 3:8 Every man of strength and every warrior from Israel was called together into one unified force.
Judith 3:9 They occupied and strengthened their high mountain positions, and they fortified their cities.
Judith 3:10 Again, they ritually purified their clothing and put on sackcloth. They threw themselves face down on the ground, and they begged God to save them.
Judith 4:1 When the children of Israel heard that Holofernes, the king of the Assyrians, was greatly expanding his territory and that he was coming towards them by way of the coastal road,
Judith 4:2 they were extremely afraid of him, considering all that he had done to the regions that were near them.
Judith 4:3 They were also greatly alarmed by the sheer size of his army, because they had no way to resist them.
Judith 4:4 The people of Israel grew weary with fear, and they cried out to the Lord their God with great urgency. Both the men and their wives humbled themselves with fasting and prayers.
Judith 4:5 The priests dressed themselves in sackcloth and placed ashes on their heads in the midst of Israel. They cried out to the Lord with all urgency that He would protect His people Israel.
Judith 4:6 Ozias announced to Joakim, the high priest, and to all the elders of their cities, that everyone should gather in Jerusalem.
Judith 4:7 They wrote to all the inhabitants of Israel who were in Samaria, in the mountainous regions, and those who were beyond the Jordan. They ordered that everyone should hurry and prepare the roads for defense, the very roads Holofernes had approached.
Judith 4:8 They fortified all the high mountain passes through which an enemy could easily pass, and they placed garrisons in the towns.
Judith 4:9 They took their positions on the tops of the mountains and fortified them, placing their army to guard the routes.
Judith 4:10 And word came to Holofernes, according to reports that involved Joakim, that the children of Israel had prepared themselves for battle and had blocked the mountain passes.
Judith 4:11 Holofernes was greatly inflamed with anger. He called all the princes of Moab, the leaders of Ammon, and all the prefects of the coastal region to him.
Judith 4:12 He said to them, 'Tell me, sons of Canaan, who are these people who dwell in the mountains? What are their cities like? How large is their army, and what is the source of their strength? Why do they resist me and refuse to surrender to me?'
Judith 4:13 Achior, the leader of all the sons of Ammon, answered and said, 'Hear, O lord, a word from your servant. I will tell you the truth about this people who live in the mountains, according to what is known about the children of Israel.'
Judith 4:14 This people originated from the Chaldeans.
Judith 4:15 They settled first in Mesopotamia but refused to follow the ancestral gods who were worshipped in the land of the Chaldeans.
Judith 4:16 They departed from their idolatrous ways and worshipped the God of the universe, the true God whom they had come to know.
Judith 4:17 The Chaldeans then drove them away from their gods, so they fled into Mesopotamia and lived there for many days.
Judith 4:18 From there, they migrated and came into the land of Canaan. There, they multiplied greatly and became very powerful, possessing much gold, silver, and vast herds of livestock.
Judith 4:19 Then they went down into Egypt and became such an immense multitude that no one could count their descendants.
Judith 4:20 The Egyptians afflicted them with forced labor in clay and brick-making, humiliating them until they became slaves.
Judith 4:21 They cried out to their God, and He struck the land of Egypt with miraculous signs, bringing them out from among the Egyptians.
Judith 4:22 God parted the Red Sea for them, and He led them through the desert of Sinai, providing for all their needs abundantly.
Judith 4:23 They lived in the land of Canaan, where God established them as they built cities and planted trees. All the peoples from the mountains were rooted out before them.
Judith 4:24 They became exceedingly powerful in gold and silver, and in their vast herds of livestock, so that their multitude could not be counted.
Judith 4:25 But they sinned against their God and made idols. Because of this, they were cast out from their land and scattered throughout every land.
Judith 4:26 When they did not sin before their God, their God was merciful to them, because He hates iniquity.
Judith 4:27 But when they turned aside from the way He had given them to walk in, they were destroyed in war by many nations and led away into lands that were not their own.
Judith 4:28 And now they have returned to their God, even after enduring hunger, thirst, and many enemies in the desert. Because they returned to Him, they have plundered every nation that fell into their hands.
Judith 4:29 In every place where the children of Israel were, their God saved them. He prepared places for them in the mountains and established them there.
Judith 4:30 And now, therefore, my lord king, if there is any iniquity in this people, and they are sinning against their God, let us discover it. Then we can go up against them and conquer them.
Judith 4:31 But if there is no offense in this nation, I advise you to keep away from them, lest their Lord perhaps defend them and you become a disgrace to all the earth.
Judith 4:32 When Achior finished speaking these words, all the people around the camps murmured.
Judith 4:33 Holofernes' princes and all his ministers, as well as the nearby leaders of the Moabites and Ammonites, were enraged by Achior's words.
Judith 4:34 They said, 'Shall we then be unable to strike the children of Israel because their strength is great and their God helps them?'
Judith 4:35 Holofernes said, 'Who is God besides Nabuchodonosor? He alone is lord and king, and God of all the earth! He himself will strike them down through my hand.'
Judith 4:36 They led Achior out of the camps and took him as far as the mountains, where they tied him to a tree and left him.
Judith 4:37 Then they returned to their own camps.
Judith 4:38 The children of Israel took Achior and brought him to Ozias and the leaders of the city, and he sat in their midst.
Judith 4:39 He recounted to them everything that Holofernes had spoken, and all the words that the people had said, and the threats Holofernes had made against Israel.
Judith 4:40 The people prostrated themselves on the ground, worshipped God, and cried out to the Lord, saying:
Judith 4:1 But the children of Israel, who were living in the land of Judea, heard about all the things Holofernes had done to the chiefs of the nations and how he had plundered all their holy places. They were greatly terrified of him.
Judith 4:2 They were extremely agitated because of Holofernes, and because of what could happen to the city of Jerusalem, and to the Temple of the Lord their God.
Judith 4:3 For they had only very recently returned from a great slaughter, and all the people of Judea had just been gathered back from the captivity that devastated Jerusalem.
Judith 4:4 And all the people were still new to the land of Judea, and their sacred vessels, the altar, and the Temple itself had only just been restored from their defilement.
Judith 4:5 So they sent messages throughout all the borders of Samaria, and through Coele-Syria and Galilee, to Kaman and to Kadesh, and to the river Aision, and to the valleys of Salem.
Judith 4:6 And they began to seize all the tops of the highest mountains, and they fortified these with strongholds, and they gathered provisions in preparation for war.
Judith 4:7 And Joakim, the high priest, wrote to those who were in Bethulia and Betomesthaim, which is opposite Esdraelon, near the great plain, facing it.
Judith 4:8 Through this place, an exit could be provided for the enemy to pass through to Judea, so they should cut off access there, preventing the enemy from passing through.
Judith 4:9 For the approach to Judea was difficult and narrow, almost like a path for only two people, so that no more than one, or at most two, could pass through at the same time.
Judith 4:10 And the children of Israel cried out to the Lord their God with great urgency, and they humbled their souls with much fasting.
Judith 4:11 And the priests, and the Levites, and all who were living in Jerusalem, girded themselves with sackcloth, and prostrated themselves before the Lord, and put ashes on their heads.
Judith 4:12 And the priests covered the altar with sackcloth, and they offered sacrifices to the Lord, and also made solemn vows to the Lord.
Judith 4:13 And they cried out to the Lord God of Israel, asking that He would not deliver them as prey to those who wanted to destroy them and to cast down their inheritance—the land and the covenant given to them.
Judith 4:14 And the Lord heard their voice, and He looked upon their affliction.
Judith 4:15 And all the people of Judea, and those who lived in Jerusalem, began to prostrate themselves before the Temple, to pray humbly to the Lord, and to sprinkle ashes on their heads.
Judith 4:16 And dressed in sackcloth, they cried out to the Lord with all their might, that He would visit His people Israel with goodness and salvation.
Judith 4:17 And that He would overthrow the enemy's army in the sight of those who were provoking them to such torment.
Judith 4:18 And that He would scatter the powerful army of Holofernes, which wanted to kill them.
Judith 4:19 And after two days, all the children of Israel abstained from all the produce of the land.
Judith 4:20 And Joakim the high priest, and all the priests who stood before the Lord and ministered to the Lord, exhorted all Israel to keep watch and to pray humbly to the Lord.
Judith 4:21 Remembering that just as it happened to their fathers in the war against the Egyptians, how all their enemies were overthrown.
Judith 4:22 So, praying to their Lord, they sought peace and mercy from Him.
Judith 4:23 Therefore, all the children of Israel in the land of Judea, and those who lived in Jerusalem, fasted for thirty days before the Lord, and prayed without ceasing.
Judith 4:24 And Joakim the high priest, and all the priests who stood before the Lord and ministered to the Lord, exhorted all Israel to keep watch and to pray humbly to the Lord.
Judith 4:25 Remembering that just as it happened to their fathers in the war against the Egyptians, how all their enemies were overthrown.
Judith 4:26 So, praying to their Lord, they sought peace and mercy from Him.
Judith 4:27 And just as our fathers fasted in the desert, and just as Moses fasted for forty days and nights, so also let us fast in this war.
Judith 4:28 And they placed the war on Mount Zion before the Lord, and the war in the city of Jerusalem before the Lord.
Judith 4:29 And Joakim the high priest said to those who were in Bethulia and Betomesthaim, that they should not give the enemies an exit.
Judith 4:30 And that they should hold the mountain under siege, and that the city should be fortified with strong defenses.
Judith 4:31 So they sent messages throughout all the borders of Samaria, and through Coele-Syria and Galilee, to Kaman and to Kadesh, and to the river Aision, and to the valleys of Salem.
Judith 4:32 And all who were in these places, hearing the word of the high priest and the prefect, feared Holofernes greatly, and all gathered together as one to help their brothers.
Judith 4:33 And in all their cities, and in all their borders, they prepared for war and fortified their cities.
Judith 4:34 And they sent messages throughout all the borders of Samaria, and through Coele-Syria and Galilee, to Kaman and to Kadesh, and to the river Aision, and to the valleys of Salem, telling them to hold the mountain under siege, and that the city should be fortified with strong defenses.
Judith 4:35 Therefore, all the children of Israel in the land of Judea, and those who lived in Jerusalem, fasted for thirty days before the Lord, and prayed without ceasing.
Judith 4:36 And Joakim the high priest, and all the priests who stood before the Lord and ministered to the Lord, exhorted all Israel to keep watch and to pray humbly to the Lord.
Judith 4:37 Remembering that just as it happened to their fathers in the war against the Egyptians, how all their enemies were overthrown.
Judith 4:38 So, praying to their Lord, they sought peace and mercy from Him.
Judith 4:39 And just as our fathers fasted in the desert, and just as Moses fasted for forty days and nights, so also let us fast in this war.
Judith 4:40 And they placed the war on Mount Zion before the Lord, and the war in the city of Jerusalem before the Lord.
Judith 5:1 It was reported to Holofernes, the commander of the Assyrian army, that the children of Israel were preparing themselves for battle and had closed off the mountain passes. They had also taken control of every high mountain peak and placed guards there.
Judith 5:2 Holofernes became extremely angry. He called together all the princes of Moab, the leaders of Ammon, and all the governors from the coastal regions.
Judith 5:3 He said to them: 'Tell me, what kind of people are these who live in the mountains? What is their city, or what are their cities? How strong are they? What is their excellence, given that they have offered me so little resistance and have not come out to meet me?'
Judith 5:4 Then Achior, the leader of all the children of Ammon, replied and said: 'If you would be pleased to listen, my lord, I will speak the truth in your presence about these people who live in the mountains, and no lie will come out of my mouth.'
Judith 5:5 These people are descendants of the Chaldeans.
Judith 5:6 They first settled in Mesopotamia, because they refused to follow the gods of their ancestors, who were worshipped in the land of the Chaldeans.
Judith 5:7 They turned away from the ways of their fathers and served a multitude of idols.
Judith 5:8 And because of this, the anger of their God rose against them. They were driven out of their homeland and migrated to the region of Mesopotamia, where they lived for a long time.
Judith 5:9 Their God told them to leave their dwelling place and go into the land of Canaan. They settled there and became extremely wealthy in gold, silver, and vast numbers of livestock.
Judith 5:10 Then they went down into Egypt and lived there for four hundred years, so much so that their descendants multiplied greatly.
Judith 5:11 But when the king of Egypt dominated them and oppressed them with forced labor, building cities with bricks and clay, they cried out to their Lord. Their Lord then struck the entire land of Egypt with various plagues.
Judith 5:12 Their God then led them out of the land of Egypt and performed wonders for them.
Judith 5:13 He divided the Red Sea into twelve parts and led them across on dry ground. He drowned all those who pursued them, along with their great army, in that same sea.
Judith 5:14 They took the land of Edom and of all the children of Moab, and they lived in it, as they came into Canaan.
Judith 5:15 They drove out all the inhabitants of the mountainous land.
Judith 5:16 They lived in the regions of these lands and became powerful in the mountains of Edom and Syria. They settled there.
Judith 5:17 As often as they did not sin in the sight of their God, good things were with them. For their God hates iniquity.
Judith 5:18 But after they turned away from the path that their God had given them, they were destroyed in wars by many nations. Many of them were led away captive into lands that were not their own.
Judith 5:19 The temple of their God was brought low, their dwelling places on earth were destroyed, and their heavenly sacrifice—the sacrifices they offered to God—was laid waste.
Judith 5:20 But when they returned to their Lord God, coming up from the captivity where they had been scattered, and took possession of Jerusalem—where their Sanctuary is—and settled in the mountains, because the mountains had been desolate:
Judith 5:21 Now, my lord the king, if you would be pleased to inquire of your servant, if there is any iniquity among them in the sight of their God, let us go up to them. For then their God can deliver them to you, and they will be brought under the yoke of your power.
Judith 5:22 However, if there is no offense committed by these people in the sight of their God, we will not be able to resist them. For their God will defend them, and we will become a disgrace to the entire world.
Judith 5:23 And it came to pass: when these words that Achior had spoken ceased, all the princes of Holofernes became very angry. They planned to kill him, saying:
Judith 5:24 'Who is this man, to say to the children of Israel that their God will defend them? As if they truly have the strength of demons!'
Judith 5:25 Now then, Holofernes, commander of the army, because his words are true, let us seize him and send him into the city of Bethulia. Then we will see him killed along with the others.
Judith 5:26 So that when the city is captured, he too will perish by our hand. Then he will know that Holofernes is as powerful as our god, and our land will take revenge with their spears.
Judith 5:27 Holofernes then said to Achior: 'Because you have prophesied, saying that the nation of Israel is defended by their God, you are to show that there is no God except Nebuchadnezzar: when we have killed all of them as if they were one man, then you too will perish with them by the sword of the Assyrians, and you will be completely destroyed along with the entire nation of Israel.'
Judith 5:28 And I will show you that Nebuchadnezzar is the lord of the entire earth, and there is no other besides him.
Judith 5:29 When you return, and are found dead among them, you will acknowledge that the god who sent you against us is indeed present in all our region.
Judith 5:30 And they themselves, when they have taken you, will lead you to the mountain of Bethulia and place you on its summit.
Judith 5:31 And if they are put to shame by the one who is in the mountains, or if there is nothing there that you believe in them, he will not find you as dead, and then we will restore you as one who is not slain.
Judith 5:32 But if their God is not their strength, as you suppose, then he will deliver you into our hands, and we will kill the entire nation of Israel. I will make sure you die, and you will not find yourself among them. Then we will deal with you as one who has not been slain.
Judith 5:33 And he [your God] does not wish for you to avoid death; rather, I myself will kill you.
Judith 5:34 Therefore, take him, lead him to the mountain of Bethulia, place him on its summit, and leave him there.
Judith 5:35 So they took Achior, went out from the camp, came to the mountain of Bethulia, and placed him on its summit.
Judith 5:36 And behold, the children of Israel were on the summit of the mountain, and seeing him, they came down to him.
Judith 5:37 They took him and led him into Bethulia and placed him in their midst.
Judith 5:38 And he recounted to them everything that had happened to him from Holofernes, and how Holofernes' people had planned to kill him.
Judith 5:39 He told them how he himself had spoken about his own people, and how Holofernes had spoken about him, and how he had decided to kill him.
Judith 5:40 And all the children of Israel, hearing the words of Achior, were greatly afraid. They prostrated themselves on the ground and worshipped God, and said:
Judith 5:1 It was reported to Holofernes, the general of the Assyrian army, that the children of Israel had prepared themselves for battle and had blocked the mountain pass.
Judith 5:2 Holofernes became extremely angry. He then summoned all the leaders of Moab, the commanders of Ammon, and all the chieftains of the coastal region.
Judith 5:3 He said to them: "Tell me, people of Canaan, who are these people living in the mountains? What is their city, or what is their country? What is their strength, and how numerous are they?"
Judith 5:4 Who is the commander of their army? And why do these people alone refuse to come and meet me, when all who live in the eastern regions have submitted?
Judith 5:5 Then Achior, the leader of all the people of Ammon, replied: "Listen, General, to what your servant has to say. I will speak the truth in your presence, for no lie will come from my mouth before you."
Judith 5:6 These people are descendants of the Chaldeans.
Judith 5:7 They first settled in Mesopotamia because they refused to follow the gods of their ancestors, who were worshipped in the land of the Chaldeans.
Judith 5:8 They deviated from the path of their parents and worshipped the God of the sky, the God whom they came to know. Their own gods then rejected them, so they fled into Mesopotamia and lived there for many days.
Judith 5:9 Then their God told them to leave their dwelling place and go into the land of Canaan. They remained in that land, becoming rich in gold and silver, and possessing a very large amount of livestock.
Judith 5:10 From there, they went down into Egypt and lived there until the famine in the land of Canaan ended. They multiplied and became a great people there, so much so that their multitude was countless.
Judith 5:11 Because of this, the king of Egypt resisted them. He humiliated them by making them work with mud and bricks, and he made them his slaves.
Judith 5:12 They cried out to their God, and He struck the land of Egypt with various plagues.
Judith 5:13 When the Egyptians had driven them out, and they had fled the plague sent by God, the Egyptians wanted to pursue them and bring them back to their own territories.
Judith 5:14 Then the God of the sky cried out, and the waters dried up. They crossed the Red Sea on their journey into the desert, abandoning all their former boundaries.
Judith 5:15 They lived in the deserts of Mount Sinai, and they caused many disputes against the God of the sky.
Judith 5:16 And when the God of all the earth became angry with them, He commanded them to go into the region of the Amorites, and all the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hittites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who had been in the desert for many years.
Judith 5:17 And they lived there for many years while God remained angry with them.
Judith 5:18 And after these things, when they had provoked Him, and fled from Him, and retreated from their own land, and left Egypt, and lived in the desert for many years:
Judith 5:19 And when the God of all the earth became angry with them, He commanded them to go into the region of the Amorites, and all the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hittites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who had been in the desert for many years.
Judith 5:20 And they lived there for many years while God remained angry with them.
Judith 5:21 And after these things, when they had provoked Him, and fled from Him, and retreated from their own land, and left Egypt, and lived in the desert for many years:
Judith 5:22 And when the God of all the earth became angry with them, He commanded them to go into the region of the Amorites, and all the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hittites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who had been in the desert for many years.
Judith 5:23 And they lived there for many years while God remained angry with them.
Judith 5:24 And after these things, when they had provoked Him, and fled from Him, and retreated from their own land, and left Egypt, and lived in the desert for many years:
Judith 6:1 Holofernes said to Achior: "Because you are from Judea, and like one of the captives from Israel, you have spoken these words to me as if I would not change my mind and act against you with malice."
Judith 6:2 But do not think you will survive, while you despise the strength and power of Holofernes.
Judith 6:3 And this will happen to you—you will not live—because you will not immediately be allowed to leave our land. Instead, you will be taken to the mountain where your people are gathered.
Judith 6:4 So that, when the sword of my mouth has cut them down, and you likewise perish along with them, you will know that I am the god over all the lands.
Judith 6:5 And you will prove that it is Holofernes who has the power to destroy you and all the mountainous land.
Judith 6:6 And Holofernes commanded his servants, who were standing in his courtyard, to seize Achior and lead him to Bethulia, and to hand him over into the hands of the sons of Israel.
Judith 6:7 And the servants of Holofernes, taking him, went through the plains. From the flatland, they ascended into the mountains and came to the springs that were below Bethulia.
Judith 6:8 When they approached the city gates, they let Achior down, bound with ropes, and left him there. Then they returned to Holofernes.
Judith 6:9 But the sons of Israel, coming down from their city, came to him. They untied him and brought him to Bethulia, presenting him in the midst of their people.
Judith 6:10 And Ozias, the leader of the city, questioned him as to who he was, or from where he came, or why he had been left behind by the Assyrians.
Judith 6:11 He responded, sitting in the midst of the leaders and all the people, and told them all the words of Holofernes' counsel. He recounted how he himself had spoken in the midst of the Assyrians and how Holofernes had commanded that, for this reason, he be handed over to the Israelites.
Judith 6:12 And therefore, pray to the God of the universe to deign to send His judgment upon their army, for just as he reproached me, so also has he deigned to remember your disgrace.
Judith 6:13 And all the people trembled when Achior spoke these words, and prostrating themselves on the ground, they adored the Lord, saying with one voice:
Judith 6:14 Lord God of the universe and the earth, look upon their arrogance, and regard our humility. Turn your face against those who test you, and in those who hope in you, show your power.
Judith 6:15 And now, brother, do not despair for your life, because we will take you in. Together we will die, or together we will live.
Judith 6:16 Because you remembered us in the presence of Holofernes, and the Lord heard your words, therefore we also will do this good thing for you.
Judith 6:17 And Ozias blessed him and promised to take him into Bethulia, so that those who wished to cast him out of the city would also be lacking in their purpose.
Judith 6:18 And they brought him to the house of Ozias, who made a great feast for Achior. Ozias also called all the elders to the feast.
Judith 6:19 And after this, all of them implored the Lord of Israel, that He would deign to deliver His people.
Judith 6:20 And the next day, after all the army of strong men were gathered to help their wives and children and to preserve their cities, Ozias commanded all who lived in Bethulia, and all who lived in their land, to descend with all their animals to the water wells, and to consume the water, and he commanded that they conserve water for necessity.
Judith 6:21 And he commanded all the women, and boys, and all the girls, and all the elderly, and all the young men, and all the infants to descend to the waters.
Judith 6:22 And all gathered, men, and women, and boys, and all the elderly, and all the young people, and all the infants, and all the aged women, and all the children, to the waters.
Judith 6:23 And all drank water until they were thirsty, and there was no water in the wells to satisfy them.
Judith 6:24 And it came to pass that, after twenty days, the water in the cisterns failed. There was no water in the city for drinking for all the citizens, and women, and children, and men, and everyone who was in the city.
Judith 6:25 And all in the city gathered—children, and women, and elders—to Ozias and to all the leaders of the city, and crying out, they said:
Judith 6:26 May God judge between us and you, for you have made us die of hunger and thirst, and you have delivered us into the hands of the Assyrians.
Judith 6:27 And now, why do you not surrender our city into the hands of the Assyrians, so that we may die, and not endure this punishment we now face: perpetual hunger, thirst, and death, because of all our iniquities? Why do we have to hear the cries of our wives, and our children, and our daughters, whom we see suffering from hunger, and thirst, and eternal death?
Judith 6:28 And now, we know that there is no salvation for us. We seek to surrender, so that we may not die in the sight of those whom we know to be merciful.
Judith 6:29 For it is better for us to serve the Assyrians than to die in the sight of those whom we know to be merciful, and not to hear the cries of our wives, and our children, and our daughters, whom we see suffering from hunger, and thirst, and eternal death.
Judith 6:30 And now, we know that there is no salvation for us. We seek to surrender, so that we may not die in the sight of those whom we know to be merciful.
Judith 6:31 And now, we ask you to deign to give us five more days, so that in these days we may see if perhaps the Lord our God changes His plan and deigns to have mercy on us.
Judith 6:32 For He will not entirely abandon His people. And if He wills it, He will not leave us to perish in the sight of all nations.
Judith 6:33 And if He wills it, He will not leave us to perish in the sight of all nations, but will deign to deliver us.
Judith 6:34 And Ozias said to them: "Believe me, we will not surrender you, unless by this time I have told you, if we do not see the help of our God, then we will do as you have said."
Judith 6:35 And he swore to them, and all the people swore, and said: "Amen." (Meaning, 'So be it.')
Judith 6:36 And all returned into the city, and there was no water for drinking for all the citizens, and women, and children, and men, and everyone who was in the city.
Judith 6:37 And after this, all the people implored the Lord, that He would deign to have mercy on them, and that He would deign to deliver them.
Judith 6:38 And all the people said: "Amen." (Meaning, 'So be it.')
Judith 6:39 And it came to pass in those days that Judea was not without aid, and Bethulia was not without aid.
Judith 6:40 And all the nations came to Bethulia, and to all the cities of Judea, and to all the cities of Samaria, and to all the cities of Galilee, and to all the cities of the region of the Philistines, and to all the cities of the region of the Ascalonites, and to all the cities of the region of the Azotians, and to all the cities of the region of the Accaronites, and to all the cities of the region of the Getthites, and to all the cities of the region of the Gadarenes, and to all the cities of the region of Samaria, and to all the cities of the region of Galilee.
Judith 7:1 When the children of Israel heard that Holofernes had taken up positions throughout all the mountainous region where they lived, they went and dug cisterns all over the highest mountain.
Judith 7:2 And the children of Israel went up to Mount Bethel, and to Besthom, and to Chobai, and to Aetnan, and to Salem, and to Theco, and to Abelmai, and to all the places where there were springs of water.
Judith 7:3 Holofernes and his entire army then set up camp. Their troops were immensely large, numbering one hundred seventy thousand men and twelve thousand horsemen. There were also countless camels, donkeys, and mules with them, making it an incredibly vast multitude.
Judith 7:4 They set up their camp across the wide valley near Bethulia, at the spring located in its field. Their forces stretched out across the plain, from Dothaim all the way to Gabee, extending eastward.
Judith 7:5 However, the children of Israel lit fires in their watchtowers. They remained on guard all night, watching all around to protect themselves.
Judith 7:6 Holofernes then approached their water spring with all his cavalry that was with him. He occupied it and placed his cavalry guards there, along with armed men from the Assyrian army.
Judith 7:7 He then advanced against the children of Israel into the mountains. He went up to Bethulia and occupied all the entrances to the city.
Judith 7:8 Near their aqueduct, he positioned a troop of twelve hundred cavalrymen, and with them, twenty thousand foot soldiers.
Judith 7:9 They proceeded into the valley with all their might. They went up to the water source of Bethulia and seized all the water, including their spring, and remained there with their forces.
Judith 7:10 Then the leader of the children of Ammon, Achior, approached Holofernes and said: "Listen, my lord, to a word from the mouth of your servant. I will speak the truth in your presence, and no lie will come from my mouth."
Judith 7:11 "This people, who live in the mountains, are faithful to the living God. Therefore, it is impossible for them to be defeated by those who wish to attack them, unless they have turned away from their God."
Judith 7:12 "For whenever they abandon Him, they are given over in battle to disgrace. And whenever they perform acts of repentance, strength to resist is given to them by the God of heaven."
Judith 7:13 Holofernes said to Achior: "Who are you to prophesy to us today and say that we should not attack the people of Israel, just because their God defends them?"
Judith 7:14 "And I will burn alive the one who sent you from your land, if you dare to retract even the smallest part of what you have said."
Judith 7:15 "Do not think that I cannot resist your God more strongly. But when I know that your prophecies will not come true, then I will utterly destroy you."
Judith 7:16 "And now, so you may know that every spirit overcomes every god, and all my power is stronger than all powers, do not lie to yourself by saying that I cannot conquer this people who live in the mountains."
Judith 7:17 "Do not fear my presence, nor let your heart be crushed, if you have spoken this word to me."
Judith 7:18 "But if you tell me that your God is stronger, why is it that you do not want me to bring Him to you and offer Him as my sacrifice?"
Judith 7:19 Then he gave the order, and they brought Achior out of the camp. They led him to Bethulia and left him tied to a tree so that they might get all the truth from him, should he choose to announce it to his people.
Judith 7:20 And they returned to Holofernes and reported to him everything they had done with Achior, including leaving him tied to a tree near Bethulia.
Judith 7:21 Holofernes became inflamed with anger at Achior and said to him: "If you are not in this city, so that I may see the evil I will inflict on you, I will never worship you, nor do anything for you."
Judith 7:22 "But if you go into the land you mentioned, worship me, and I will make you my son."
Judith 7:23 And he commanded that those who had reported Achior to him should report everything Achior had done in the city.
Judith 7:24 He sent word to every province of the Assyrians, commanding them to gather an army and march to Bethulia to capture it.
Judith 7:25 And all were gathered, and they marched to Bethulia, and set up camp against it, besieging it for thirty days.
Judith 7:26 During this time, their water and food supplies within the city began to run out.
Judith 7:27 When the children of Israel saw that their water and food supplies were failing, and that many in the city were growing weak, and that whoever tried to drink from the waters was dying, they knew the situation was dire.
Judith 7:28 Then all the women and men, young and old, boys and girls, gathered around Ozias and the leaders of the city and said:
Judith 7:29 "May the Lord judge between us and you, because you have done us wrong! You were unwilling to speak with the Assyrians, preferring to hand us over into their hands for disgrace and death."
Judith 7:30 "And now we are perishing from hunger and thirst. We can no longer resist them."
Judith 7:31 "So now, gather the people and tell them to go out to Holofernes and surrender themselves into his hands. Do not allow us to die."
Judith 7:32 Ozias said: "Listen, my brothers, I am also not pleased that we should surrender ourselves into the hands of our enemies. But I cannot do with you what you have requested."
Judith 7:33 "But if you are willing to wait five days, until the Lord our God has mercy on us and sends us help: then, if He does not have mercy on us and does not send us help, we will do with you what you have requested."
Judith 7:34 And Ozias said: "I know that this is the reason why our God is troubling you: to test you, to see if you are worthy of your God."
Judith 7:35 "But do not lose heart in this time of tribulation. Instead, hope in God, so that His mercy may reach you."
Judith 7:36 "And if you wish that we hope in Him for five days, and if He does not have mercy on us and does not send us help, we will do with you what you have requested."
Judith 7:37 And all the people said: "We will do with you what you have said, but let us not die on the way!"
Judith 7:38 Ozias and the leaders of the city swore an oath and said: "In the name of the Lord, and in the name of our God, and in the name of our fathers, we will do with you what you have requested."
Judith 7:39 And all the people swore an oath and said: "In the name of the Lord, and in the name of our God, and in the name of our fathers, we will do with you what you have requested."
Judith 7:40 Ozias and the leaders of the city then swore another oath and said: "In the name of the Lord, and in the name of our God, and in the name of our fathers, we will do with you what you have requested."
Judith 8:1 Now, Judith, a widow, heard all these things. She was the daughter of Merari. Merari was the son of Ox, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Oziel, who was the son of Elchia, who was the son of Anania, who was the son of Gedeon, who was the son of Raphaim, who was the son of Achitob, who was the son of Melchia, who was the son of Enan, who was the son of Nathania, who was the son of Salathiel, who was the son of Simeon, who was the son of Ruben.
Judith 8:2 And her husband, Manasses, had died during the days of the barley harvest.
Judith 8:3 He had been binding bundles of grain in the field, when intense heat overcame him. He died in his bed and was buried with his ancestors in Bethulia.
Judith 8:4 Now, Judith had been his widow for three years and six months.
Judith 8:5 She had made a private tent for herself on the roof of her house, and she lived there in seclusion with her maids.
Judith 8:6 She wore sackcloth around her waist and the garments of a widow. She fasted every day of her life, except on Sabbaths, New Moon days, and the feast days of the house of Israel.
Judith 8:7 She was very beautiful to look at, and a most honorable woman. Indeed, her husband Manasses had left her a house, a very good fortune, fields, and harvests of grain, as well as oxen and sheep.
Judith 8:8 And the widow carefully managed all these things, so that no one could find fault with her in any way.
Judith 8:9 Everyone praised her highly, because she feared the Lord. So much so that there was no one who spoke any evil word about her.
Judith 8:10 But when Judith heard that Holofernes was pressing against the city, she refused to leave her house, nor would she abandon the privacy of her tent.
Judith 8:11 And all these things were being spoken among the people, just as Ozias had said. All the water had now failed, and the city was in great distress. There was nothing left among them to refresh themselves or to quench their thirst.
Judith 8:12 And all the men, women, and children gathered before Ozias and all the leaders of the city, saying to them all:
Judith 8:13 “May God be merciful to you, and grant us peace.”
Judith 8:14 “Because we have now completely failed, and every one of our people is dying from thirst.”
Judith 8:15 “So now, gather all the men who are in the city, so that we may attack all our adversaries. If we can, we will kill them; if not, we ourselves will die. Let us not see our wives and our children dying before our eyes.”
Judith 8:16 “We implore you, by our God, to do for us as we have said.”
Judith 8:17 And Ozias said to them: “Brothers, be of good courage, and bear with us for five more days, during which we will wait for mercy from the Lord.”
Judith 8:18 “For the Lord does not forsake us to such an extent that if these days pass and no help comes to us, I will act according to your word.”
Judith 8:19 And when he had said these things, they dismissed the people, each one to his camp. And they set guards over the walls and towers of their city.
Judith 8:20 And they sent everyone to his post. And when Judith had heard all these things, she sent her maid to call Ozias, and Chabris, and Charmis, the elders of the city.
Judith 8:21 And they came to her, and she said to them: “What is this word, to which you have agreed, that you would surrender our city to the Assyrians if help does not come to you within five days?”
Judith 8:22 “And who are you, that you put the Lord to the test?”
Judith 8:23 “This is not a word that strengthens the hearts of men and gives spirit, but rather one that provokes to anger and ignites fury.”
Judith 8:24 “You have set a time limit for the Lord yourselves, and you have appointed a day for Him according to your own will.”
Judith 8:25 “But because the Lord is most patient, He therefore reproves you and shows you an example of His wrath, in which you do not know what He will do to you.”
Judith 8:26 “But we now know that we have sold ourselves, to be handed over into the hands of our enemies, because there is no helper for us from among you.”
Judith 8:27 “But you, my brothers, do not test the Lord our God.”
Judith 8:28 “For if it does not please Him to help us within five days, He has the power, in whatever way and on whatever days He wishes, to deliver us or to strike us down in the sight of our enemies.”
Judith 8:29 “But do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God, because God is not like man, nor is the Son of Man like the son of man in wisdom or power.”
Judith 8:30 “Therefore, since we await patience and consolation from Him, do not be angry against Him, but humble yourselves under His hand.”
Judith 8:31 “For if He does not choose to help us within five days, and if He Himself wills it at a time when He chooses, nevertheless we will pray to Him that He may deliver us.”
Judith 8:32 “But also, you, Judith, do not test God. For all these things are the works of God.”
Judith 8:33 And when Ozias had said these things, Judith said to him: “What I have said to you, I have not spoken as a human, but I speak to you according to God.”
Judith 8:34 “For if you truly test Him, and He does not wish to help you within these five days, as you desire, you will not be able to escape His hand.”
Judith 8:35 “And the entire house of Israel will perish because of your decisions.”
Judith 8:36 “Or who are you, who tempt the Lord, and there is no sense in you?”
Judith 8:37 “Now, however, you see how we are dying, and our entire people are dying, while there is no one who can help us.”
Judith 8:38 “And behold, if there is no help, and it does not befall us, this situation will be before the Lord, so that He may hear our prayers.”
Judith 8:39 “And now, brothers, because you are the leaders of the people, and their hearts and courage depend on you:”
Judith 8:40 “And now, if my word is on your lips and you follow it, no effort will be futile, and your help will certainly be at hand.”
Judith 9:1 Judith then cried out to the Lord, saying:
Judith 9:2 My Lord God, hear me, your handmaiden, and look upon my work—my mission to save Israel—because Holofernes has arrogantly thought to challenge your power, and the honor of your holy temple, and against your altar, which you yourself established.
Judith 9:3 For he openly declared that he would defile and destroy your temple and your altar by his own might.
Judith 9:4 Look now: the Assyrians have multiplied their forces and their power. They boast in their horses and cavalry, in the strength of their foot soldiers, and in their shields, lances, arrows, and slings.
Judith 9:5 And they do not know that you are the God of all creation, who crushes wars from the beginning of time—and Lord is your very Name.
Judith 9:6 Lift up your arm as you have done from the very beginning of Israel's history, and crush their power with your might. Then their strength will fall into complete ruin.
Judith 9:7 Because Holofernes declared, 'My generation will not remember their existence'—meaning he intends to wipe out Israel completely—'and I will destroy their land.'
Judith 9:8 But you, Lord God, do not overlook your power in the things I am about to do, but make what I have said come true, and guide my purpose to its completion.
Judith 9:9 For your power is not found in numbers, nor does your strength reside in the mighty. Instead, you are the Protector of the humble and the meek.
Judith 9:10 You are the helper of orphans, and the supporter of the lowly, and the champion of the weak, and the Protector of those who are without hope, and the Savior of all who hope in you.
Judith 9:11 Remember, Lord, your covenant and your oath which you swore to Isaac, and your promise that you made to Jacob, to multiply their descendants.
Judith 9:12 For from the beginning of time, you were not one who needed our created beings, but you are the one who works your power within us because of who you are.
Judith 9:13 And now, Lord, look: the Assyrians are puffed up in their own strength, and they are exalted in their horses and cavalry. They boast in the might of their foot soldiers.
Judith 9:14 They despise you, and they threaten your holy places, and the glory of your Name. Cast down their strength with your own might, and crush their power with your divine fury, because they say, 'There is no one who can resist me!' Be my helper, Lord my God, and hear my prayer. And grant me words and clever deceit upon my lips, so that I may deceive them. For my strength comes from your power, and my heart will be exalted in your might. Because through my words you will deceive them, and through the appearance of my face you will cast them down. And every nation will know that you are God, who crushes the powerful by your might. Amen.
Judith 9:1 On that specific day, Judith fell to the ground on her face, put ashes on her head, and covered herself with sackcloth. And at the very hour when the daily incense was offered in Jerusalem in the Temple of the Lord, Judith fell prostrate to the ground and opened her mouth to the Lord, praying:
Judith 9:2 "Lord, God of my father Simeon, You gave him a sword to defend against the foreigners who, driven by lust, violated the private parts of women, shamelessly exposed them, stained blood in their anger, and acted against natural law."
Judith 9:3 "And You said that such acts should not be. Yet they allowed their own sons to expose themselves with them in these acts. So You brought their leaders to utter destruction, and their beds, which were defiled by lust, became a snare for them."
Judith 9:4 "And You struck down their men along with their women, and their sons with their daughters, bringing about their ruin. And now, Lord, I beg You to help me, Your handmaid, who trusts in You, and I trust in You alone; I have nothing else in my life."
Judith 9:5 "For You have called forth the past, and those things that happened afterward, and those things that exist now, and all things yet to come; You made them all into one unified plan. And the events that unfold, You caused them, and Your judgments are already prepared and certain."
Judith 9:6 "Because of this, Lord, You who have prepared all things, and whose judgments are in all things, look now upon this plea, to which I attach myself entirely to You, and I direct my supplication to You."
Judith 9:7 "For the army of the Assyrians has grown vast, and their pride has multiplied. No one worries about their sword, their army, or their men, but in Your Name, I pray that through me, Your handmaid, You will destroy those who believe they have something they can use to oppose You."
Judith 9:8 "For You are the Almighty God, and You alone are God, and there is no other who can stand against You."
Judith 9:9 "And look now upon the camp of the Assyrians, just as You deigned to look upon the camp of the Egyptians, when they pursued the children of Israel with their chariots and a multitude of warriors."
Judith 9:10 "You covered their legions with the sea, and the sea drowned them, and their name has been extinguished even to this very day."
Judith 9:11 "Do the same for this army, Lord, and cast down their entire military force."
Judith 9:12 "And by the hand of Your maidservant, may I become a refuge for my people, and may their pride be broken, and their destruction brought upon them, and all who are proud in Your Name."
Judith 9:13 "And may all nations know that You are God, and there is no other besides You."
Judith 9:14 And Judith cried out with a loud voice to the Lord, saying: "God of Israel, hear me, Your handmaid."
Judith 9:1 Then Judith prayed: "O Lord, O Lord, God of my father Simeon, you gave a sword into his hand for vengeance against foreigners, who had provoked his zeal to anger, who had committed incest in their seed, and had defiled the side of Thamar, and had defiled him who bore them.
Judith 9:2 And you gave their wives over to plunder, and their daughters into captivity, and you divided all their spoil among your sons, who were inflamed with zeal for you and with horror at their fornication. You have helped me, a sinful woman, O Lord my God, to take vengeance against those who did these things.
Judith 9:3 For behold, the Assyrians have boasted in their own strength, and in their horses and horsemen, in the power of their foot soldiers, and in the confidence of their shields, and in the trust they place in their own defenses, and in their arrows, and in their catapults, and in all kinds of weapons.
Judith 9:4 And they said: 'We will go up to the farthest parts of the earth, and we will inherit the desolate places and the entire land, and we will capture all the nations that are in it, and all the peoples who dwell there, and the entire land.'
Judith 9:5 Now therefore, O Lord God of heaven and earth, creator of the waters, and King of every creature, hear my prayers.
Judith 9:6 And make their counsel come to naught, so that they may know that you are the Almighty God, and there is no other besides you who fights for Israel.
Judith 9:7 And by your power, put their arrogance to confusion, and by my sword, confuse them.
Judith 9:8 For your strength is not in a multitude of men, nor is your might in the number of foot soldiers, but in the simplicity of your prayer, and in the strength of your heart; you alone are God, and you can deliver your people.
Judith 9:9 And make their counsel come to naught, so that they may know that you are the Almighty God, and there is no other besides you who fights for Israel.
Judith 9:10 And by your power, put their arrogance to confusion, and by my sword, confuse them.
Judith 9:11 For your strength is not in a multitude of men, nor is your might in the number of foot soldiers, but in the simplicity of your prayer, and in the strength of your heart; you alone are God, and you can deliver your people.
Judith 9:12 And Judith said: 'Amen.' And she fell upon her face to the ground, and adored God, and said: 'Amen, amen, amen.'
Judith 9:13 And Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'
Judith 9:14 And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'
Judith 9:15 And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'
Judith 9:16 And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'
Judith 9:17 And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'
Judith 9:18 And again Judith cried out to the Lord, and said: 'Blessed are you, O Lord, almighty God, and great are you, and strong are you, and merciful are you, and in you I trust, and in you I glory, and in you I praise myself.'
Judith 10:1 After these things, when the crying and the mourning had stopped throughout the city,
Judith 10:2 Judith rose up in the middle of the night and called her personal maidservant, who was in charge of all her affairs.
Judith 10:3 And she took a small bottle of fine olive oil and anointed herself with the very best perfume. She carefully styled her hair and then placed a decorative headdress over it, adorning herself with her most joyful and festive clothing.
Judith 10:4 She put her sandals on her feet, and arranged all her jewelry: her bracelets, her bangles, her rings, her earrings, and every other adornment she possessed.
Judith 10:5 She was exceedingly beautiful in appearance, designed to captivate and deceive the eyes of all the men who would gaze upon her.
Judith 10:6 And she instructed her maidservant to take all the vessels containing her carefully prepared bread, and her wine, and her water jar, and her pulverized, cooked food. She had set aside all her provisions, which she had sanctified for herself and for her mission, and she loaded them onto the maidservant to carry.
Judith 10:7 And they both went out of the city together, so they could travel to the camp of the Assyrians.
Judith 10:8 And when they reached the city gates, Uzziah, and the elders of the city, Chabris and Charmis, met them there.
Judith 10:9 And when they saw her, they were struck with profound astonishment, and they were utterly overwhelmed by her beauty.
Judith 10:10 Nevertheless, because they understood her true intention and the mission she was undertaking, they encouraged her, and said: "May the Lord go with you in His divine strength, and may the Lord accomplish everything you have in your heart and mind to do, so that there may be glory for the children of Israel, and exaltation for Jerusalem."
Judith 10:11 And Judith, adoring the Lord, responded: "Amen, amen."
Judith 10:12 And she remained in that same place for a moment, keeping her head veiled as was customary for prayer, and she prayed to the Lord.
Judith 10:13 And she set out with her maidservant, traveling through the mountain area, where there was a spring of fresh water.
Judith 10:14 And they arrived at the Assyrian outposts, where the guards immediately met them.
Judith 10:15 And seizing her, the guards began to question her: "Tell us, where are you from? And where are you coming from right now? Or where are you going?"
Judith 10:16 And she said to them: "I am from the daughters of Canaan—meaning, a Gentile woman from outside Israel—and I am fleeing from a terrible fate, for I know that my people are about to become your prey."
Judith 10:17 And when she had been brought to the outpost where the commanders were stationed, they said, "Take her and lead her to Holofernes immediately."
Judith 10:18 And so they came, and they arrived at Holofernes' personal tent.
Judith 10:19 And they led her directly to Holofernes, and she stood before his presence.
Judith 10:20 And Judith managed to speak with Holofernes inside his tent.
Judith 10:21 And Holofernes questioned her, saying: "Tell me, from what people are you? And from where do you come?"
Judith 10:22 And Judith said: "I am from the daughters of Israel, and I am fleeing from them, because they are about to become your prey."
Judith 10:23 And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."
Judith 10:24 And Judith said: "My Lord, I am truly one of your servants, and during my stay, no harm will come to me at your hand."
Judith 10:25 And Holofernes replied again: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."
Judith 10:26 And Judith said: "My Lord, please listen to my words, and no harm will come to you during my days here."
Judith 10:27 And Holofernes repeated: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."
Judith 10:28 And Judith said: "My Lord, listen to my words, and no harm will come to you during my days here."
Judith 10:29 And Holofernes said again: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."
Judith 10:30 And Holofernes then asked: "From where do you know, that they are destined to become prey?"
Judith 10:31 And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."
Judith 10:32 And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."
Judith 10:33 And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."
Judith 10:34 And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."
Judith 10:35 And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."
Judith 10:36 And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."
Judith 10:37 And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."
Judith 10:38 And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."
Judith 10:39 And Judith said: "My Lord, I am one of your servants, and no harm has come to me at your hand thus far."
Judith 10:40 And Holofernes said: "For the duration of your stay, no harm will come to you at my hand."
Judith 11:1 Then Holofernes said to her: "Be comforted, woman, and do not fear in your heart. For I have never harmed anyone who truly wanted to serve King Nabuchodonosor."
Judith 11:2 "If your people's army had not disrespected me, I would not have raised my hand against them."
Judith 11:3 "Now therefore, tell me, for what reason did you flee from them and come to us?"
Judith 11:4 And Judith said to him: "Listen to the words of your servant, because if you heed my words, the Lord will accomplish with you a deed that He will never abandon, so that He may bring His judgment upon this people through you."
Judith 11:5 "For as King Nabuchodonosor, the ruler of the earth, lives, and as his power lives — that power which resides in you for the punishment of every living soul — not only do men serve him, but even the wild beasts of the field obey him."
Judith 11:6 "Indeed, the strength of your spirit must also be proclaimed to us, master. For this is announced throughout all nations: that you alone are truly good in his entire kingdom, mighty in power, and unique in counsel."
Judith 11:7 "And let no one despise your words. Rather, whoever would abandon you would not possess the glory of their own name."
Judith 11:8 "For let the truth be known to King Nabuchodonosor and his power: that the entire land serves your might."
Judith 11:9 "Indeed, what I have heard about you and about your prudent wisdom should not be diminished by anyone throughout the entire land."
Judith 11:10 "Because you alone are truly good in the entire kingdom, mighty in power, and admirable in counsel."
Judith 11:11 "But let me not speak in vain. What your servant has spoken to your face is true, because your servant, a mere woman, has learned from the God of Israel that God will hand them over into your power."
Judith 11:12 "Because they have sinned against the Lord their God, and there is no one among them who can defend them, unless it is to turn away His wrath from themselves."
Judith 11:13 "Now therefore, my master, let this word come to your hearing: if there is any falsehood or sin within that city, behold, I will tell you, and I will not lie to your face."
Judith 11:14 "And in all these things that I have said, your servant will not lie, nor will she be false."
Judith 11:15 "But if you are indeed inclined to do what is true and just, and do not abandon those principles, I will never abandon you throughout all the days and nights and years of your life, for as long as my strength endures."
Judith 11:16 "And we will go out at night through the gate into the valley, and I will walk in the valley all through the night. Then I will come to you in the daytime and announce to you in what specific way they have sinned against my God."
Judith 11:17 "And you will know that the Lord will guide me from among Israel, in what I see and hear and in all my work. And the Lord will know that there is nothing in this city that truly belongs to these people, except for their own lives—meaning no divine protection remains for them."
Judith 11:18 "And I will return to you again on that day and tell you how they will transgress all the precepts that God has commanded them, that they should not eat from the grain, or the wine, or the oil."
Judith 11:19 "And they will do these things out of great necessity, to obtain all these supplies. They will be compelled to eat them and begin to sin against their God. Then a message will come to you, and I will personally announce to you how they will transgress all the precepts that God has commanded them, concerning not eating from the grain, or the wine, or the oil."
Judith 11:20 "And in all these matters, I will announce everything to you and hand them over to you—and all the province of Judea, and the very middle of Jerusalem."
Judith 11:21 And Holofernes said to her: "May the Lord your God bless you, because He sends you to us, so that our power may be glorified among all who inhabit the land."
Judith 11:22 "And woman, your speech is good, and there is no one in the land who can compare with you."
Judith 11:23 "Indeed, your strength and the wisdom of your heart are wonderful, in that you have come to us and related these things."
Judith 11:1 Holofernes spoke to her, saying, “Take courage and do not be afraid in your heart. I have never harmed any man who willingly served Nebuchadnezzar, the king of all the earth.”
Judith 11:2 “If your people had not shown contempt for my god,” he continued, “I would not have raised my spear against them. But they themselves have brought these consequences upon themselves.”
Judith 11:3 “Now, tell me: from where have you fled from them, and why have you come to us? You are meant to be safe. Therefore, take courage and live through this night and hereafter.”
Judith 11:4 “Indeed, no one will harm you. Instead, everyone will treat you well, just as they treat my own servants.”
Judith 11:5 Judith replied to him, “Receive the words of your handmaid. For if you follow the counsel of your servant, the Lord will bring this matter to a perfect conclusion through you, and He will not frustrate your plans.”
Judith 11:6 “As surely as Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the earth, lives, and as truly as his power—which resides in you for the chastisement of every living soul—is real: not only do people serve him through you, but even the wild beasts of the field are subjected to him through your command.”
Judith 11:7 “Rather, the ancient traditions of Assyria are now fulfilled through your might, confirming the power of your god. No one who wanders from his path will escape.”
Judith 11:8 “For we have heard of your wisdom and your prudence. It has been reported throughout all the land that you alone are truly excellent in all the king's dominion, powerful in every military discipline.”
Judith 11:9 “And it is no wonder that you alone are so excellent, since you serve Nebuchadnezzar, the king of all the earth, and he himself has sent you to bring order and reform to the entire world.”
Judith 11:10 “For this also, which we have heard, we speak of: it has been proven true that the Jewish people do not eat blood, nor an animal that has been strangled, nor anything unclean. Indeed, they have abstained from these foods for a very long time.”
Judith 11:11 “Therefore, I, your handmaid, pondering all these things, said within myself: 'I will go to my lord Holofernes and reveal to him all their secrets. I will show him by what means he can capture them all, without any detriment to his army.'”
Judith 11:12 “For they have rebelled against you, and they are full of iniquities, and the wrath of my Lord has been provoked against them.”
Judith 11:13 “Furthermore, because their food supplies have failed them and all their water has now run out, they have decided to attack their livestock. And what they are not permitted to eat, they have now resolved to consume: they have determined to eat blood, and animals that have been strangled, and other unclean things.”
Judith 11:14 “They have even sent word to Jerusalem—because the inhabitants there have committed these very transgressions—for them to bring all the consecrated fruits, wine, and oil from the land. They have arranged to bring these provisions to a ritually clean place and consume them there.”
Judith 11:15 “And knowing these things, I know that when they begin to do these forbidden acts, they will be given into your hands for utter destruction. You will not need to engage in battle, but without a single fight, I will lead you to bring the entire multitude to your feet.”
Judith 11:16 “And I, your handmaid, knowing all this, fled from them. The Lord has sent me to report these very things to you.”
Judith 11:17 “And your handmaid worships God day and night. I will go out into the valley and pray to the Lord, and He will tell me when they commit these specific sins.”
Judith 11:18 “Then, upon returning, I will inform you, and at that time you shall advance with your entire army, and there will be no one able to resist you.”
Judith 11:19 Holofernes listened to her words with joy, and his servants were astonished by her wisdom. They spoke among themselves, saying:
Judith 11:20 “There is no such woman upon the earth, from one end to the other, in both beauty and wisdom.”
Judith 11:21 Then Holofernes said to her, “God has done well to send you ahead of your people, so that victory might be delivered into our hands through you.”
Judith 11:22 “And because your words are excellent, and your face is beautiful, you shall be safe in my household. You will never lack bread or wine.”
Judith 11:23 “Instead, you shall remain here with me, and no one will harm you. They will treat you just as they treat my own servants.”
Judith 11:24 Judith replied to him, “I cannot eat from the provisions you have commanded to be given to me, lest I commit an offense against God and transgress His law.”
Judith 11:25 “Instead, I will eat from the provisions I have brought with me. Or, if you truly wish for me to suffer deprivation, then I will eat from your supplies.”
Judith 11:26 Holofernes then asked her, “What if the provisions you have brought with you run out while you are staying with us?”
Judith 11:27 “For the journey is long, and for a long time, you will not be able to return to your city.”
Judith 11:28 Judith replied, “As your soul lives, my lord, I will not consume all the provisions I have brought with me, until the Lord accomplishes through my hand the purpose I have set out to achieve.”
Judith 11:29 Then Holofernes’ servants led her into her tent, and she rested there.
Judith 11:30 And she rose early, before dawn, and commanded her handmaid to prepare her ritually pure food, as she was accustomed to do.
Judith 11:31 And she went out into the valley with her handmaid and bathed herself in the fountain of water.
Judith 11:32 And when she had finished bathing and risen, she prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, that He would direct her path toward the deliverance of her people.
Judith 11:33 Then she returned and remained ritually pure in her tent, eating her own provisions, until the fourth day.
Judith 11:34 And on the fourth day, Holofernes prepared a feast for his servants. He invited none of his officers, only those who were with him in his personal tent.
Judith 11:35 And he said to Bagao, the eunuch who was in charge of all his affairs, “Go and persuade that Hebrew woman to willingly agree to stay with me, so that she may eat and drink with us.”
Judith 11:36 “For it is a disgrace for us if we allow such a woman to leave without having had her company. Indeed, if we cannot sway her, she will mock us.”
Judith 11:37 Then Bagao went in to Judith and said, “Let my lady not be afraid to enter my lord's presence, so that she may be honored before him and eat and drink with him, and be merry. For this day will be like a feast day for you.”
Judith 11:38 Judith replied to him, “Who am I to contradict my lord? I will do everything that pleases him, and whatever is good in his sight.”
Judith 11:39 Judith arose and dressed herself in her finest garments, putting on all her feminine adornments. Her handmaid went before her and spread the beautiful veil, which Judith had acquired from Bagao on the day she was received, before Holofernes. Holofernes himself was sitting upon his splendid cushion, fashioned from purple fabric, gold, emeralds, and other precious stones.
Judith 11:40 And when Judith entered, Holofernes’ heart was deeply stirred by her appearance. He was filled with an overwhelming desire to lie with her, for he had never seen such a woman in all his life.
Judith 11:1 So Achior said to him: 'Hear, my lord, a true word from the mouth of your servant. I will tell you the truth about this people who live as neighbors to you and inhabit these mountains. I will not speak a lie in your presence.'
Judith 11:2 This people descended from the Chaldeans —meaning, their ancestor Abraham was called out of Ur of the Chaldeans by God.
Judith 11:3 When they first came into Mesopotamia, they stayed there for a time, because they refused to follow the idolatrous gods of their ancestors who were in the land of the Chaldeans.
Judith 11:4 They turned away from the ways of their idolatrous fathers and worshipped the one true God of the universe, the God whom they truly knew.
Judith 11:5 Because of this, others cast them out from the presence of their gods. So, they fled into Mesopotamia and lived there for many days.
Judith 11:6 From there, they migrated to the land of Canaan and lived upon it. They grew rich with gold and silver and an exceedingly immense number of livestock.
Judith 11:7 Later, when they went down into Egypt and were oppressed by King Pharaoh, they cried out to their God. In response, He struck the entire land of Egypt with various plagues.
Judith 11:8 And God cast them out of the land of Egypt and made a clear separation between them and the Egyptians —at the Red Sea.
Judith 11:9 He dried up the Red Sea before them and led them on a path through the desert of Kadesh-Barnea, even to the farthest known parts of the world.
Judith 11:10 They lived in the land of the Amorites beyond the Jordan in the desert, stretching as far as Edom, and on Mount Gilead, and throughout all the land of Goshen, even to those distant regions.
Judith 11:11 But after they sinned in the sight of their God, and they departed from His ways, acting like many other nations do, He cast them away from His presence and delivered them to be plundered by their enemies.
Judith 11:12 They were led away into Babylonia, where they remained for many years in exile.
Judith 11:13 Afterwards, they returned to their God, and He brought them back from Babylonia and restored them to their own land, and they possessed it once again.
Judith 11:14 And now they themselves live in these mountains, and they have many cities and villages within them.
Judith 11:15 Furthermore, because they have not sinned in the sight of their God according to the customs of the other nations you have seen, even if they have not sinned and have not acted against their God as other peoples do— therefore, if they have not sinned, nor are they without His protection, your power cannot harm them.
Judith 11:16 But if they have sinned in the sight of their God, then you can subdue them for yourself.
Judith 11:17 And so that you may know that what I say is true, consider that when they have not been sinners in the sight of their God, they have not been an obstacle to you, but rather they have been victorious in battle and in slaughter.
Judith 11:18 Therefore, my lord, O king, and mighty ruler of the earth: if there is any iniquity in this people in the sight of their God, then destroy them, so that I may advance, pursue, and conquer them.
Judith 11:19 However, if there is no offense in this people, then beware lest you resist against their God, lest you bring ruin upon yourself. For their God is their protector, and He it is who shelters them.
Judith 11:20 And it happened that when Achior had finished speaking these words, Holofernes became very angry with Achior and said to him: 'Who are you, Achior, that you dare to prophesy to us as if you were the God of Israel?'
Judith 11:21 'But because you told us that if the people of Israel have sinned, we can conquer them— now then, so that you may know that what you have said is false, I myself will deliver you into their hands!'
Judith 11:22 'And you will see that you yourself will not be able to escape death; instead, you must die in their presence!'
Judith 11:23 'And when we have taken them captive, or captured their land, then you, so that you may know that you are their God, will die with them!'
Judith 12:1 So Holofernes gave orders that Judith should be brought to the place where Holofernes’ personal silverware was stored. He set out some of his own food for her to eat and some of his own wine for her to drink.
Judith 12:2 But Judith said, 'I will not eat any of these things, lest I commit an offense. Instead, I will eat only from the food that I brought with me.'
Judith 12:3 Holofernes asked her, 'If the provisions you brought run out, where will we find more food like them for you? For there is no one from your own people living among us here.'
Judith 12:4 Judith answered him, 'As the Lord lives, my food will not run out during this journey I have undertaken, until the Lord accomplishes through me what I have planned to do.'
Judith 12:5 So Holofernes’ servants brought her into her own tent, and she slept until midnight. She arose a short while before the first dawn.
Judith 12:6 Then she sent a message to Holofernes, saying, 'My lord, please give orders that your servant be permitted to go out for prayer, and from there I will take my food and drink.'
Judith 12:7 Holofernes therefore gave orders that they should not stop her. So she stayed in the camp for three days, and each night she would go out into the valley of Bethulia and bathe herself in the spring of water that was within the camp.
Judith 12:8 And as she returned from bathing, she would pray to the Lord God of Israel that He would direct her path towards the liberation of His people.
Judith 12:9 After returning purified, she would remain in her tent each day, until the hour came for her to eat her food.
Judith 12:10 On the fourth day, Holofernes prepared a feast for his servants. Then he said to Bagoas, his eunuch, 'Go and persuade that Jewess to come willingly to eat and drink with us.'
Judith 12:11 He continued, 'For it would be shameful if so great a woman were to scorn a man by refusing to speak with him. If we do not invite her, she will surely mock us.'
Judith 12:12 So Bagoas went from Holofernes' presence and entered Judith’s tent. He said, 'Do not hesitate, my good lady, to come before our master, so that you may be honored in his presence and drink wine with us in merriment.'
Judith 12:13 Judith answered him, 'Who am I to contradict my master? Whatever is pleasing in his sight, I will do it quickly.'
Judith 12:14 And rising, she adorned herself with her finest garments and all her feminine ornaments. Her maidservant went ahead of her to show Holofernes how he should receive her as she entered his presence.
Judith 12:15 When Judith entered and reclined at the table, Holofernes was deeply troubled in his spirit and stirred with strong desire. He became exceedingly lustful for her, coveting her from the very first moment he saw her.
Judith 12:16 Then Holofernes said to her, 'Drink, and be merry with us!'
Judith 12:17 Judith replied, 'I will drink, my lord, for my spirit is exalted this day above all my previous days.'
Judith 12:18 And she took the food and drink her maidservant had prepared for her, and she ate and drank in his presence.
Judith 12:19 Holofernes was greatly delighted with her, and he drank an excessive amount of wine, more than he had ever drunk in his entire life.
Judith 12:1 Then Holofernes commanded that Judith be led to the place where his treasures were kept, and he also ordered that she should eat his own food and drink his own wine.
Judith 12:2 And Judith answered him: "I will not eat any of these things, so that I may not commit a sin against God. Instead, I will eat from the provisions that I brought with me from Judea."
Judith 12:3 Holofernes then said to her: "If these provisions that you brought with you run out, what will we do for you then?"
Judith 12:4 Judith replied: "As your soul lives, my lord, your handmaid will not use up all of these provisions until God accomplishes through me what I have planned." After she said this, Holofernes's servants spoke to her about this matter throughout the night.
Judith 12:5 Then Judith went into her own private chamber.
Judith 12:6 She stayed in the camp for three days. During the nights, she would go out into the valley of Bethulia and wash herself at a spring of water located within the camp.
Judith 12:7 And when she returned, she would pray to the Lord, the God of Israel, asking Him to direct her path for the liberation of His people.
Judith 12:8 She would re-enter her chamber in a state of ritual cleanliness and would remain there until she ate her meal in the evening.
Judith 12:9 On the fourth day, Holofernes prepared a feast for his servants. He then said to Bagoas, his chief eunuch: "Go and persuade that Hebrew woman to come of her own free will and eat and drink with me."
Judith 12:10 For Holofernes believed it would be shameful for him to have such a woman in his camp and not enjoy her company. In fact, he thought that if he did not invite her, he would be ridiculed by the Hebrews themselves.
Judith 12:11 So Bagoas went to Judith and said: "Do not be afraid, good lady, to come to my lord. You will be honored in his presence, and you will eat with him and drink wine with joy."
Judith 12:12 And Judith responded: "Who am I to contradict my lord? Whatever is pleasing in his eyes, I will do immediately. This will be a joy for me until the day of my death."
Judith 12:13 So she rose and adorned herself in her finest garments. Then she entered and stood before Holofernes.
Judith 12:14 Holofernes had her brought onto his couch and said to her: "Drink now, and feast with me, and enjoy yourself."
Judith 12:15 Judith replied: "I will drink, my lord, because my spirit has been lifted this day more than on any previous day of my life."
Judith 12:16 And she took the food and ate and drank before him from what her maidservant had prepared for her.
Judith 12:17 Holofernes was greatly pleased with her, and he drank an excessive amount of wine, more than he had ever drunk in his entire life.
Judith 12:18 When evening arrived, each of his servants got up and hurried to their quarters. Then Bagoas closed the doors of the bedroom and left.
Judith 12:19 Everyone was exhausted from the feast, especially Holofernes. Only Judith remained alone in the bedroom with him.
Judith 12:20 When Holofernes was heavily intoxicated with wine, he lay down on his bed.
Judith 12:21 Judith sent word to her maidservant to stand outside the bedroom and wait until she came out, as she usually did for her prayers.
Judith 12:22 Judith had previously told Bagoas that she would go out for her prayers, and he had been informed.
Judith 12:23 After everyone had left and there was no one present, from the most trusted to the least important servant, Judith stood by Holofernes's head, praying with tears and moving her lips in silence.
Judith 12:24 And she said: "Strengthen me, Lord God of Israel, and look upon the work of my hands. Grant that I may accomplish what you have promised, just as you promised."
Judith 12:25 Then she drew out Holofernes's sword, which was lying beneath his pillow.
Judith 12:26 And grasping the hair of his head, she said: "Strengthen me, Lord God, in this very hour."
Judith 12:27 And she struck him twice on his neck, severing his head. She completely separated his body from his head and then concealed the head beneath his mosquito netting, which covered his bed.
Judith 12:28 She then went out and handed Holofernes's head to her maidservant, instructing her to put it into her provision basket.
Judith 12:29 Then both of them left the tent according to their usual routine, as if going out for prayer. They passed through the camp, circled the valley, and finally arrived at the gate of the city of Bethulia.
Judith 12:30 From a distance, Judith called out to the guards on the walls: "Open the gates, for God is with us, He who has shown great strength in Israel!"
Judith 12:31 When the people heard her voice, they rushed to the city gates and summoned the elders of the city.
Judith 12:32 Everyone gathered, from the least to the greatest, because they had given up hope that she would ever return.
Judith 12:33 And lighting their lamps, they opened the gates for them. They welcomed Judith and her maidservant, and a great light of joy shone forth.
Judith 12:34 Then Judith said to them: "Praise the Lord our God, who has not abandoned those who hope in Him!"
Judith 12:35 And through me, His handmaid, He has fulfilled His mercy, which He promised to the house of Israel. Through my hand, He has killed the leader of your enemies!
Judith 12:36 Then, drawing Holofernes's head from her basket, she showed it to them, saying: "Behold, the head of Holofernes, the commander of the Assyrian army! And behold his own mosquito netting, where he lay in his drunkenness, and where the Lord our God struck him down!"
Judith 12:37 And the mouth of the Most High God was humbled, by being defeated by the hand of a woman.
Judith 12:38 Then all the people worshipped God, saying: "Blessed are You, O Lord, who have utterly destroyed your enemies on this very day!"
Judith 12:39 And Ozias, the leader of the people of Israel, said to Judith: "Blessed are you, daughter, by the Lord, the most high God, above all women on the earth."
Judith 12:40 Blessed be God, who created the universe and the earth, who guided you in striking down the head of the leader of our enemies! For today, He has so magnified your name that your praise will never depart from the mouths of men, who will forever remember the power of God. Amen, amen.
Judith 13:1 When silence finally settled in the camp, Holofernes was weighed down by excessive wine and drunkenness, and he lay passed out on his bed.
Judith 13:2 Judith called her maidservant and went out of the bedroom, just as she did every other day. This was because Bagoas believed the Jewish woman was asleep and not with Holofernes.
Judith 13:3 Judith closed the door of her private room, and standing before God, she prayed with a loud voice, saying, "Lord God, You who possess all power, look upon this very hour and bring about my purpose."
Judith 13:4 "Break the power of my enemies, and fulfill my plan. For all my strength is in You, and all my authority depends on Your arrangements."
Judith 13:5 After she had prayed these things, she came to Holofernes’ tent and took his sword, which was hanging over his bed.
Judith 13:6 And standing over his head, she uncovered his head, and she took her sword—meaning, she firmly grasped his sword, which was now her instrument.
Judith 13:7 And she struck him twice in his neck, severing his head. She then took his head and gave it to her maidservant.
Judith 13:8 The maidservant put the head into her bag. Then they both exited according to their custom, as if they were going out for prayers. They passed through the camp and ascended the mountain.
Judith 13:9 When they were still in the camp but had reached the city gate, Judith said to the gatekeepers, "Open the city gates for me, and I will show you the head of Holofernes, the commander of the entire Assyrian army."
Judith 13:10 After the gates were opened and they had entered the city, Judith called all the people together and showed them Holofernes' head, saying:
Judith 13:11 "Behold, the head of Holofernes, the leader of the entire Assyrian army! And look at his canopy, under which he lay in his drunkenness! And behold, I myself struck him in his neck and severed his head!"
Judith 13:12 And she said to them, "Give thanks to the Lord your God, who has saved you today from the hand of your enemies, and who gave Holofernes into my hands."
Judith 13:13 And all the people who were in Jerusalem praised the Lord their God, saying, "Blessed are You, Lord our God, who has saved us today from the hand of our enemies."
Judith 13:14 And all the people praised the Lord and adored God, saying, "Amen, Amen."
Judith 14:1 Judith then said to all of them, "Listen to me, brothers! We will hang Holofernes' head on our city walls."
Judith 14:2 "Then, every man who takes up weapons, and every person living in our city, should gather together. And you must all go out as if you are about to attack the enemies of the sons of Israel."
Judith 14:3 "The goal is for the enemy to flee, so that we can capture the leaders of the Assyrians and advance towards their camps."
Judith 14:4 "When their commanders see Holofernes' head, they will instantly turn and flee. They will try to escape by any means, over land and across the waters, and you must pursue them."
Judith 14:5 After Judith had taught them these things, she commanded them to do exactly what she had told them.
Judith 14:6 So Judith went up onto the city walls and hung Holofernes' head there. Then, every man took up his weapons, and they gathered just as she had instructed them.
Judith 14:7 And it happened that when the morning light appeared, they displayed their weapons on the wall, and all of them went out together, making it seem as if they were launching an attack on the Assyrian camps.
Judith 14:8 The Assyrian scouts saw them and immediately ran to their superiors, announcing what they had observed.
Judith 14:9 When these superiors went to Holofernes' tent and did not find him, they reported it to their commanders.
Judith 14:10 So the commanders went to Holofernes' tent. They stood around it and called out to the doorkeeper, who was lying before the tent's curtain, saying, "Open the tent, go inside, and tell your master:"
Judith 14:11 "Your enemy has woken you up, and he has gone out to insult you, behaving like a loose woman."
Judith 14:12 No one could stir him or open the tent, for they were all asleep together. Holofernes' eunuch, Bagoas, was drunk, as were all of his servants.
Judith 14:13 So the commanders went with Bagoas and entered the tent. They found Holofernes lying on his bed, a decaying corpse.
Judith 14:14 And immediately, they cried out in alarm. Tearing their clothes, they rushed out to their general and all his commanders.
Judith 14:15 They announced to them that Holofernes was lying dead, and his head had been cut off.
Judith 14:16 Every general and all the leaders of the Assyrians cried out in dismay. They were terrified and trembled with fear. Tearing their clothes, they rushed out to every part of their camps.
Judith 14:17 They announced that Holofernes had been killed, and their leaders were dead, and their clothes were torn in lament. All of them together were extremely afraid, and they trembled and quaked with terror. They prepared to flee, not daring to speak to one another.
Judith 14:18 Instead, everyone, as if in a single rush, prepared for flight. They abandoned everything that was in their camps as if they were fleeing for their lives.
Judith 14:19 And when they knew that Holofernes was killed, they fled by the roads and through the mountains, and through all the valleys, and along all the paths, abandoning all their camps. All who fled were saved. But those who had remained in the camps were killed by the very ones who had fled, in the chaos of their desperate rout.
Judith 15:1 Upon hearing the news of Holofernes’ death, our enemies immediately fled. They began to run in every direction across the plains and into the mountains. Those who were still in the Assyrian battle-camps, upon hearing that the Judean forces had captured and killed Holofernes, also fled in a panic.
Judith 15:2 All who were scattered among the hills and mountains from the Assyrian camps, abandoning their war effort, continued to flee. Then the children of Israel, all who could find weapons, rushed against them, pursuing the retreating army.
Judith 15:3 Holofernes had fallen in his own tent. And all of his army who had been besieging the gate of the city of Bethulia fled at once.
Judith 15:4 Then Joakim, the High Priest, and the elders of Israel who lived in Jerusalem came to Bethulia to see Judith and greet her with honor.
Judith 15:5 All the men and all the women of her city, Bethulia, came to her. When they had gathered, they all blessed her with one voice, saying: “You are the glory of Jerusalem! You are the joy of Israel! You are the honor of our people!”
Judith 15:6 Because you did all these things by your own hand, you have brought great good to Israel. And you have stirred courage in their hearts and in our hearts with all these deeds. May a blessing be upon you forever.
Judith 15:7 And all the people cried out, “Amen!”
Judith 15:8 All the women of Israel gathered together around her and blessed her. After several days, Ozias, the ruler of the city, came to her and said to her:
Judith 15:9 “Lady, may you be blessed by the Lord God of Israel, because this great thing has been accomplished through you.”
Judith 15:10 And Judith responded to him: “As the Lord lives, victory has been achieved in Israel through my hand.”
Judith 15:11 And Ozias said to her: “Blessed are you, daughter, by the Lord God of Israel, because you did these things. The Lord empowered you and exalted your name, so that all people may glorify you.”
Judith 15:12 And all the people said, “Amen!”
Judith 15:13 And again Ozias said: “Blessed are you, daughter, by the Lord God of Israel, because through you victory has been accomplished in Israel.”
Judith 15:14 After thirty days, she returned to her home. And she did not have a man intimately in all the days of her life, from the day her husband Manasses died.
Judith 15:15 She lived a life of honor and purity throughout those days, until her death. And she remained in her home until she was one hundred and five years old.
Judith 15:16 They buried her in the tomb of Manasses, her husband. And they observed a seven-day mourning period for her.
Judith 15:17 And no enemy attacked or troubled Israel in all the days of Judith’s life, and for a long time after her death.
Judith 15:1 When all the inhabitants of Judea who were in the vicinity heard about the victory, they became as one mind.
They went out to meet the returning people.
Judith 15:2 Everyone came out from Bethlehem, Bethmestim, Bethoron, Beli, Chola, Cades, the torrent stream, the city of Magdeddi, and from the fields and valleys.
They all went to meet them together, arriving in Bethulia on the third day.
Judith 15:3 And all the Jews in Bethulia—men, women, and children—came out, each one wearing their best cloak.
They wanted to bless Judith and see her.
Judith 15:4 And all of them came, and with one voice they blessed her, saying:
'You are the glory of Jerusalem! You are the joy of Israel! You are the honor of our people!'
Judith 15:5 'For you have done all these things by your own hand, just as Israel has performed great deeds.
May you be blessed forever!'
Judith 15:6 In those days, all the people in Bethulia blessed her with joy, gladness, and dancing.
Judith 15:7 And all the men of Israel—namely, those who had fought—brought out the spoils they had taken from Holofernes.
This included all his silver, gold, garments, vessels, and all his furnishings. They gave everything to Judith.
Judith 15:8 And all the people rejoiced and feasted with gladness in the presence of the holy people for thirty days.
Judith 15:9 However, Judith gave everything that had belonged to Holofernes to the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem.
This included all his spoils.
Judith 15:10 The people in Bethulia rejoiced exceedingly because of Judith, and all of Israel was filled with joy.
Judith 15:11 Then all the priests from Jerusalem gathered, and all the elders of Israel came.
They came to see the good things the Lord had done for Israel and to speak with Judith and bless her.
Judith 15:12 And they rested from war for many days.
Then they went to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and purification to God.
Judith 15:13 And Judith went up to Jerusalem with all the goods of Holofernes that the people had given her.
She dedicated all the offerings to the Lord and presented all the vows made by the people.
Judith 15:14 And all the people saw her, and they blessed her, and they marveled at her.
Every day of her life was a blessing in the days of Israel.
Judith 15:15 And Judith remained in Bethulia for many days.
All those who belonged to her household also remained in Bethulia.
Judith 15:16 And she did not have intimate relations with a man until her death.
This means she remained a widow.
Judith 15:17 And she left all her possessions to her handmaid, and all her wealth to her own house and family.
She also left everything she had received from Holofernes, and everything that had belonged to him.
Judith 15:18 And she was honored at all times.
She lived honorably all her days in Bethulia.
Judith 15:19 And there was no one in those days, or for many years after, who disturbed Israel after the death of Judith.
Judith 16:1 At that time, Judith sang this song to the Lord, as she said:
Judith 16:2 Start a new song to the Lord with drums, sing to Him with cymbals, play for Him with psalms and praises, for a new song has burst forth from Him.
Judith 16:3 For the Lord is the One who crushes wars. Lord is His very name.
Judith 16:4 He has established His presence among His people, so that He might deliver us from the power of all our enemies.
Judith 16:5 Assyria came from the mountains to the north, with a mighty army. Its vast numbers blocked the rivers, and their horses covered the valleys of the land.
Judith 16:6 Holofernes threatened to invade our land and kill our young men with a sword. He planned to give our infants as plunder and our virgins into captivity.
Judith 16:7 But the Almighty Lord crushed them. He gave them into the hands of a woman, and they were defeated.
Judith 16:8 Their powerful warriors did not fall by the hand of young men, nor did the strong, legendary giants strike them down. No mighty heroes attacked them.
Judith 16:9 Instead, the hand of Judith, daughter of Merari, struck him with a fatal blow, and he fell, causing his army to flee.
Judith 16:10 For all his strength and power would melt away like water.
Judith 16:11 Holofernes was in his own camp, along with all his generals and his officers.
Judith 16:12 Then they began to cry out to one another, asking, "Who is this person who dared to attack us in this manner?"
Judith 16:13 And so it happened that they, and all who were with them, fled from the camp.
Judith 16:14 Fear, trembling, and utter confusion overcame them, and they quickly departed, scattering into the desert.
Judith 16:15 And the children of Israel, who were present at the camp, pursued the Assyrians all the way to the borders of their land.
Judith 16:16 They returned, taking possession of everything the Assyrians had left behind.
Judith 16:17 And they consecrated feast days, offered sacrifices to the Lord, and praised God, because He had saved them.
Judith 16:18 And it happened that after many days, Holofernes and all his generals and officers had completely passed away from any influence over them, and were no longer a threat.
Judith 16:19 And so the children of Israel departed with great joy and gladness, giving all praises and acts of thanksgiving to the Lord.
Judith 16:20 They offered sacrifices to the Lord because He had saved them from the power of their enemies, and there were no longer any enemies within all their borders.
Judith 16:21 And so the children of Israel remained in Jerusalem, celebrating the feast day.
Judith 16:22 Judith was greatly honored throughout all the days of her life, and no one ever spoke an evil word against her.
Judith 16:23 And it came to pass that after Judith's death, no one overcame her people throughout all the days of her descendants.
Judith 16:24 And God granted her to rest in peace, and there was no war within all of her people's borders throughout all the days of her life and the days of her descendants.
Judith 16:25 And she returned to her own house and remained there for many years. She died in Bethulia, and they buried her in her father's tomb.

Judith 16:1 Let us sing a hymn to the Lord; let us sing a new hymn to our God.
Judith 16:2 Help us to glorify Your Name, O Lord, for You have destroyed wars from the beginning of time.
Judith 16:3 The Lord shatters wars, and His Name is holy.
Judith 16:4 He who places His camp among His people, snatches my life from the hands of those who plot against me.
Judith 16:5 Assyria came from the northern mountains, with the might of its great strength and a multitude of its soldiers. Their numbers covered the valleys, and their cavalry overran the hills.
Judith 16:6 For he said he would burn my lands, kill my young men with the sword, dash my infants to the ground, give my little children as plunder, and lead my virgins into captivity.
Judith 16:7 But the Lord Almighty crushed him and delivered him into the hands of a woman.
Judith 16:8 For God is not glorified by the strength of men, nor by mighty warriors, but the saving Lord is praised among the humble and meek.
Judith 16:9 For the Lord raises a shield for His people, and He places His fear upon all nations.
Judith 16:10 He stirs up nations and destroys those whose plan was to trouble His people.
Judith 16:11 Assyria came in fury, with the strength of its army, with its cavalry, its chariots, and a multitude of its fighters. Yet, they were not worthy to look upon the Lord God.
Judith 16:12 For the Lord Almighty is His Name, and He crushed them into dust before His handmaid.
Judith 16:13 Not only Holofernes, but also his army, He reduced to dust. And of all who came with him, no one escaped.
Judith 16:14 My God, I will praise You, because all virtues and powers are found in You.
Judith 16:15 My soul will rejoice in You, and in joy I will exult in You, for there is no other God besides You.
Judith 16:16 I will sing a new song to my God; my Lord is great and glorious in His strength.
Judith 16:17 For a new song has been sung to the Lord, and there is no one on earth like our God.
Judith 16:18 For the Lord exalts the humble and humbles the proud.
Judith 16:19 There is no one who can adequately praise You, O Lord Almighty, for You alone are the Almighty God.
Judith 16:20 In times of tribulation, I will call upon You, and You will rescue me.
Judith 16:21 For all things are in You, and all power, and all Your might.
Judith 16:22 Let us sing a new song and new praise to our God.
Judith 16:23 Let us magnify His Name, for He Himself is our God, and there is no other besides Him.
Judith 16:24 Let all who are proud against You be put to shame; let them be put to shame forever.
Judith 16:25 And let Him scatter them with fire and brimstone, and let all the earth adore Him.
Judith 16:26 For all things are Your works, and they are in Your power, and all things that exist are in Your will.
Judith 16:27 For the Lord is He who executes judgment throughout all the earth.
Judith 16:28 Lord God, in whose will all things that exist are, and before whose sight all flesh is troubled.
Judith 16:29 In Your judgment, all Your enemies will be overcome, and in Your wrath, all Your enemies will rise up (only to be destroyed).
Judith 16:30 In Your mouth You have placed a sword, and in Your hands, fire.
Judith 16:31 For every creature will serve You, and every spirit will honor You, because You are our Lord God, and there is no other besides You.
Judith 16:32 Woe to the wicked nation, for they have acted wickedly, and the Lord will abhor them forever.
Judith 16:33 And on the day of judgment, He will send fire and worms upon them, so that they may suffer forever.
Judith 16:34 There is no one who can adequately praise You, O Lord Almighty, for You alone are the Almighty God.
Judith 16:35 In this celebration, my soul will rejoice, and in joy I will exult in You, for there is no other God besides You.
Judith 16:36 I will sing a new song to my God, for there is no one on earth like our God.
Judith 16:37 For the Lord is He who crushed the proud, and in Your power are all things that exist.
Judith 16:38 For every creature will serve You, and every spirit will honor You, because You are our Lord God, and there is no other besides You.
Judith 16:39 In Your judgment, all Your enemies will be overcome, and in Your wrath, all Your enemies will rise up (only to be destroyed).
Judith 16:40 In Your mouth You have placed a sword, and in Your hands, fire, so that they may suffer forever.
Esther 1:1 In the days of King Ahasuerus, who reigned from the lands of India even to the regions of Ethiopia, over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces.
Esther 1:2 When he took his royal seat on the throne of his kingdom, in Susa, the royal capital city.
Esther 1:3 In the third year of his reign, he held a grand feast for all his nobles and his royal officials—the most powerful leaders of the Persian and Median peoples—and for the governors of his provinces, all gathered before him.
Esther 1:4 His purpose was to display the vast riches and glory of his kingdom, and the immense grandeur and impressive splendor of his power. This feast lasted for many days—specifically, one hundred and eighty days.
Esther 1:5 After those many days of feasting were completed, the king then hosted a feast for all the people—everyone who lived in the royal capital city of Susa, from the most important to the least. This feast lasted for seven days, and it was held in the courtyard of the royal palace garden, a beautiful area carefully designed for royal events.
Esther 1:6 From every side hung magnificent canopies woven from fine linen in sky-blue, white, and violet colors. These were held up by cords of fine linen and royal purple, attached to ivory rings and magnificent marble columns. Golden and silver couches were arranged, resting on a pavement made of precious green marble and white Parian stone, which was covered with colorful, intricately woven rugs.
Esther 1:7 Those who were invited drank from splendid golden cups, and each cup was unique, differing in design from the others. The royal wine flowed freely, an abundant supply fit for a king's majesty.
Esther 1:8 No one was forced to drink beyond their desire. Instead, the king had given specific instructions, assigning certain noble officials to oversee each table, ensuring that every guest could drink as much or as little as they pleased, according to their own will.
Esther 1:9 Queen Vashti, for her part, also hosted a feast specifically for the women, held within the royal palace of King Ahasuerus.
Esther 1:10 On the seventh day of the feast, when King Ahasuerus was feeling merry and his spirits had been excessively elevated by the wine, he issued a command to Mauman, Bazatha, Harbona, Bagatha, Abgatha, Zethar, and Charchas—the seven eunuchs who served directly in his royal presence.
Esther 1:11 His command was to bring Queen Vashti into the king's presence. She was to wear her royal crown, as his intention was to display her beauty to all the assembled peoples and nobles, for indeed, she was exceedingly beautiful.
Esther 1:12 But Queen Vashti refused. She scorned the king's command, which had been delivered by his eunuchs, and would not come. The king became furious, inflamed with intense anger.
Esther 1:13 He then consulted his wise men. These were the men who, by royal custom, always attended him, and all royal matters were decided according to their experienced judgment, for they were experts in the customs and laws of the age.
Esther 1:14 These were his closest and most trusted advisors: Carshena, Sethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan—the seven chief princes of Persia and Media. They had privileged access to the king and held the highest positions in the kingdom, ranking just below him.
Esther 1:15 What legal royal judgment should be pronounced against Queen Vashti for her failure to obey the king's command, which was delivered through the eunuchs?
Esther 1:16 Then Memucan spoke before the king and the assembled princes: 'Queen Vashti’s offense is not against the king alone, but also against all the princes and indeed all the peoples throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.'
Esther 1:17 'For news of the queen’s actions will spread to all women. This will lead them to despise their own husbands and say, “King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to appear before him, and she refused!”'
Esther 1:18 'Through this one example, all the wives of the nobles will begin to disregard their husbands' commands. Such behavior will bring sufficient contempt and anger.'
Esther 1:19 'If it pleases the king, let a royal decree be issued in your presence, and let it be formally written into the laws of Persia and Media. This decree should state that Queen Vashti is never again permitted to enter the king’s presence. Furthermore, her royal position and honor should be given to another woman who proves herself more worthy than she.'
Esther 1:20 'When this royal decree goes forth from your palace and is proclaimed throughout your entire, vast empire, all wives, both noblewomen and commoners, will then respect their husbands.'
Esther 1:21 Memucan's words pleased both the king and his princes. So the king acted in accordance with Memucan's counsel.
Esther 1:22 The king then sent official letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, written in the local script and language of each province. Their message was that every husband should be the undisputed master and authority in his own household, and this directive was to be made clear to all the peoples.
Esther 1:1 In the days of Ahasuerus—this King Ahasuerus was the ruler who reigned from India all the way to Ethiopia, over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces.
Esther 1:2 At the time when he was seated upon the throne of his kingdom, the capital city of his reign was Susa.
Esther 1:3 Therefore, in the third year of his reign, he prepared a grand feast for all his princes and his highest officials—including the most powerful among the Persians and Medes, and all the governors of the provinces—all gathered in his royal presence.
Esther 1:4 This was so he could display the great wealth and glory of his kingdom, and the magnificence and boastful power of his rule, over the course of many days—specifically, for one hundred and eighty days.
Esther 1:5 When those days of the grand feast were completed, he then commanded that all the people who were present in the city of Susa, from the most prominent to the least, should have a seven-day feast prepared. He ordered this to be arranged in the courtyard of the royal palace, and in the garden that was renowned for its royal design and marvelous craftsmanship.
Esther 1:6 And there were hangings of purple, blue, fine white linen, and green fabrics, which served as luxurious curtains. There were also marble columns and gold pedestals, with couches of silver and gold for reclining. The floor itself was paved with precious stones: emerald, mother-of-pearl, and marble, all arranged in a wondrously diverse pattern.
Esther 1:7 Those who had been invited drank from golden cups and various other vessels, each different from the last. They served drinks in an alternating and abundant fashion, in a manner befitting the king's great wealth and generosity.
Esther 1:8 No one was forced to drink beyond their desire; instead, the king had instructed his servants that each person should be offered whatever they wished to drink, exactly as it pleased them.
Esther 1:9 Queen Vasthi also prepared a separate feast for the women within the royal palace, in the very place where King Ahasuerus was accustomed to reside.
Esther 1:10 On the seventh day, when the king was feeling particularly joyful and exuberant from the excessive pleasure of the wine, he commanded Mauman, Bazatha, Harbona, Bagatha, Abgatha, Zethar, and Charchas—these were the seven eunuchs who served in his royal presence.
Esther 1:11 He commanded them to bring Queen Vasthi before the king, with her royal crown placed upon her head, so that he could display her beauty to all the people and princes, for she was exceptionally beautiful.
Esther 1:12 But she refused, and disdained to come, contrary to the king's command which he had sent through his eunuchs. The king became enraged, burning with intense fury.
Esther 1:13 He then consulted the wise men who, according to royal custom, always accompanied him, and through whose counsel he managed all his affairs and ruled his kingdom. These men were experts in the laws and ancient customs.
Esther 1:14 Close to him were Charsena, Sethar, Admatha, Tharsis, Mares, Marsana, and Mamuchan—these seven princes of Persia and Media were his closest advisors, and they held the foremost positions in the kingdom.
Esther 1:15 He asked them, 'What penalty does Queen Vasthi deserve by law, because she refused to obey the command of King Ahasuerus, which he sent through his eunuchs?'
Esther 1:16 Then Mamuchan answered in the presence of the king and the other princes, 'Queen Vasthi has not only wronged the king, but also all the princes and all the peoples who live in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.'
Esther 1:17 For the queen's action will become known among all women, leading them to disrespect their own husbands, by saying: 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vasthi to come to him, and she refused.'
Esther 1:18 And by this example, all the wives of the princes of Persia and Media will likewise disdain the commands of their husbands, responding with equal boldness and indignation. From this will stem the king's most righteous indignation.
Esther 1:19 If it pleases you, let a royal decree go forth from your presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and Medes, which cannot be changed, that Vasthi shall never again enter the presence of the king. Let another queen, who is better than she, reign in her place.
Esther 1:20 And when this decree of the king, which will be promulgated throughout his entire empire, is heard by all the people—all wives, both of the great and the humble, will then show honor to their husbands.
Esther 1:21 His proposal pleased the king and the princes, and the king acted according to Mamuchan's counsel.
Esther 1:22 And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, written in the various languages and scripts that each people could hear and read, decreeing that every man should be the ruler and master in his own household. This decree was to be publicly proclaimed to every single people.
Esther 2:1 After these events, when King Ahasuerus’s anger subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what she had endured as a result.
Esther 2:2 Then the king's young attendants and his ministers said: 'Let the most beautiful virgin girls be sought out for the king.'
Esther 2:3 'Let officials be sent to search throughout all the provinces of your empire for beautiful young virgins and bring them to the city of Susa. There, they should be entrusted to Hegai, the king's eunuch and supervisor of the royal women. They should also be provided with special women's beauty treatments and all other necessities for their adornment.'
Esther 2:4 'And whichever one of them pleases the king should then reign as queen instead of Vashti.' This suggestion pleased the king, and he commanded that it be done exactly as proposed.
Esther 2:5 There was a Jewish man named Mordecai living in the city of Susa. He was the son of Jair, who was the son of Shimei, who was the son of Kish, and he was of the Benjaminite lineage.
Esther 2:6 Mordecai had been taken captive and carried away from Jerusalem at the same time King Jeconiah of Judah was exiled—when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had forcibly removed the Jewish people from their land.
Esther 2:7 Mordecai was the guardian of his uncle’s daughter, Hadassah, who was also known by her Persian name, Esther. She was an exceptionally beautiful and charming girl. After her father and mother had died, Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter.
Esther 2:8 So when the king's orders and decree were proclaimed, many beautiful girls were brought to Susa and entrusted to Hegai. Esther, along with the other lovely girls, was also given to Hegai, so she could be cared for among the royal women.
Esther 2:9 Esther pleased Hegai and gained his confidence by her demeanor. He immediately commanded that her beauty treatments be hastened, and he provided her with a special diet. He also assigned her the best of the king's maidservants. Along with fifty other selected virgin attendants, Hegai entrusted Esther and her maidservants to a prepared living arrangement and personally saw to the adornment of both Esther and her chamber.
Esther 2:10 Esther had not disclosed her nationality or her heritage, because Mordecai had strictly commanded her not to speak of it to anyone.
Esther 2:11 Daily, Mordecai walked back and forth in front of the courtyard of the house where the beautiful girls were being kept. He was constantly concerned for Esther’s well-being and eager to know what would happen to her.
Esther 2:12 Now, each girl had to complete her full preparation before going in to the king. This entire regimen of beauty treatments lasted twelve months: for six months, she would be anointed with oil and myrrh, and for the remaining six months, with perfumes and other substances necessary for adornment.
Esther 2:13 When it was her turn to enter the king’s presence, she was allowed to take with her from the women’s quarters any items she desired for her personal adornment and bring them to the king's chamber.
Esther 2:14 The girl who went in to the king in the evening would leave in the morning and go to a second palace for the royal women. This residence was under the charge of Shaashgaz, another eunuch, who supervised the king’s concubines. After this, she could no longer return to the king's presence unless the king specifically desired her and personally summoned her by name.
Esther 2:15 When the time came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail (Mordecai’s brother) whom Mordecai had adopted as his daughter, to enter the king’s presence, she chose nothing for herself beyond what Hegai, the eunuch in charge of the women, advised. Esther was, in fact, exceedingly beautiful and possessed an incredible charm; everyone who saw her was captivated by her appearance.
Esther 2:16 So Esther entered King Ahasuerus’s royal palace in the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
Esther 2:17 The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she found more favor and kindness in his sight than all the other virgins. So he placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen in Vashti’s place.
Esther 2:18 The king then commanded a great banquet to be prepared for all his princes and servants, in celebration of Esther’s marriage and coronation. He also declared a special holiday for the provinces, and distributed gifts with royal generosity, in keeping with his magnificent status.
Esther 2:19 Later, when virgins were again gathered according to custom for subsequent preparations—though Esther was now queen—Mordecai remained stationed at the royal gates.
Esther 2:20 Esther continued to conceal her nationality and heritage, just as Mordecai had commanded her. Indeed, she observed and carried out all his instructions as if she were still under his direct authority.
Esther 2:21 At that very time, while Mordecai was stationed at the royal gates, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bagathan and Teresh, became indignant. These men were doorkeepers who guarded the first entrance to the palace. They conspired to attack and assassinate King Ahasuerus.
Esther 2:22 Mordecai soon discovered this plot. He immediately reported it to Queen Esther, and she, in turn, informed the king about the matter, crediting Mordecai by name.
Esther 2:23 The king investigated the matter and confirmed the plot by both men. He then commanded that both of them be executed. Immediately, a detailed account of their crime was recorded in the royal annals, among the records of both ancient and recent kings.
Esther 3:1 After these events, King Ahasuerus elevated Haman, the son of Hammedatha, who was a descendant of Agag, and established his authority above all the other officials and leaders in his kingdom.
Esther 3:2 And all the servants of the king, who were at the palace gates, would kneel and pay homage to Haman, because the king had ordered them to do so. But Mordecai would not kneel, nor would he pay him homage.
Esther 3:3 The king's pages, who were standing at the palace gates, asked Mordecai, "Why do you not obey the king's custom?"
Esther 3:4 When they had repeatedly told him this, and he refused to listen, they reported it to Haman, wanting to see if Mordecai would persist in his refusal, for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew.
Esther 3:5 When Haman heard this and confirmed through observation that Mordecai would not kneel or pay him homage, he became extremely angry.
Esther 3:6 Haman considered it a small thing to lay hands only on Mordecai, for he had heard about Mordecai’s lineage. Instead, Haman decided to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the entire kingdom of Ahasuerus—that is, Mordecai's people.
Esther 3:7 In the first month, called Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus's reign, lots were cast into an urn in Haman's presence, to determine by which day and month the Jewish people should be destroyed. This method of casting lots is called Pur in Hebrew. The lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is called Adar.
Esther 3:8 Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people dispersed among the nations in all the provinces of your kingdom. They are separate from other peoples, using their own new laws and customs, and they disregard the traditions of others. They also refuse to obey the king's commands. It is not beneficial for the king to tolerate such a people."
Esther 3:9 "If it pleases you, issue a decree that they should perish. I will weigh out ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury for your officials."
Esther 3:10 So the king took his signet ring from his hand, which he had given to Haman, and handed it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha, of the lineage of Agag—the enemy of the Jews.
Esther 3:11 And the king said to him, "The silver you promised is yours. As for the people, do with them whatever you please."
Esther 3:12 The king's scribes were summoned in the first month, Nisan, on the thirteenth day of that month. A decree was written, exactly as Haman had commanded, addressed to all the king's satraps, the governors of the provinces, and the princes of the regions, from India to Ethiopia—one hundred twenty-seven provinces in all. The decree was written for each people in their own language and script, according to their own national customs, under the authority of King Ahasuerus, and sealed with his signet ring.
Esther 3:13 Letters were sent by royal couriers to all the provinces, ordering them to destroy all the Jews—from young children to old men, including infants and women—on a single day, which was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, called Adar. Their possessions were also to be plundered.
Esther 3:14 The text of the letter stated that this command was to be issued in all lands, so that all peoples would know and be prepared for the appointed day.
Esther 3:15 The couriers who had been sent quickly departed to carry out the king's command. Immediately, the edict was displayed in Susa, the capital city. While the king and Haman celebrated with a feast, all the Jews wept and mourned.
Esther 3:1 After these events, King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha, who was a descendant of Agag, and placed his seat of authority above all the other officials under him.
Esther 3:2 And all the king’s servants who were at the palace gate would bend their knees and prostrate themselves before Haman, because the king had commanded them to do so. However, Mordecai alone would not bend his knee, nor would he prostrate himself.
Esther 3:3 To him, the king’s attendants who were daily present at the palace gate spoke: “Why do you not obey the king’s commands, acting against his custom?”
Esther 3:4 But when he refused to listen to them and stubbornly persisted in his resolve, they informed Haman, desiring to know if Mordecai’s actions would be tolerated. For Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew, which prevented him from bowing to Haman.
Esther 3:5 When Haman heard this, and verified for himself that Mordecai would not bend his knee nor prostrate himself before him, he became exceedingly furious.
Esther 3:6 He considered it a trivial matter to lay hands on Mordecai alone, as killing just him was not enough vengeance. For he had been informed of Mordecai’s Jewish lineage. And so, he wanted to destroy all the Jews who were in the kingdom of Ahasuerus along with Mordecai; that is to say, he wanted to destroy the entire Jewish nation.
Esther 3:7 In the first month, which is called Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus’s reign, a lot was cast into an urn—which in Hebrew is called Pur—in Haman’s presence, to determine the exact day and month when the Jewish people should be massacred. And the lot fell upon the twelfth month, which is called Adar, giving Haman nearly a year to execute his plan.
Esther 3:8 Then Haman spoke to King Ahasuerus: “There is a certain people dispersed throughout all the provinces of your kingdom, and they are separated from one another, using novel laws and ceremonies. Moreover, they despise the king’s laws. And you know very well that it is not in your kingdom’s best interest for such a people to grow insolent and powerful.”
Esther 3:9 “If it pleases you, issue a decree that they perish. And I will weigh out ten thousand talents of silver to the king’s treasurers.”
Esther 3:10 Therefore, the king took his signet ring, which he used, from his hand, and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha, of the lineage of Agag—the enemy of the Jews.
Esther 3:11 And the king said to him: “Keep the silver you promised for yourself. As for this people, do with them as you please.”
Esther 3:12 So the king’s scribes were summoned in the first month, on the fourteenth day of that same month. And it was written, just as Haman had commanded, to all the king’s satraps, and to the governors of the provinces, and to the officials, from the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, which were under the dominion of King Ahasuerus, from India all the way to Ethiopia. And to each province, in its own language and script, in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed with his own signet ring, making the decree official and binding.
Esther 3:13 And letters were sent by swift couriers to all the king’s provinces, to crush and kill all the Jews—from young boy to old man, little children and women—on a single day. That day was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar. They were also commanded to plunder their possessions.
Esther 3:14 So that the decree might be proclaimed in all the provinces and become known to all peoples, they should be ready for the day of killing.
Esther 3:15 The couriers hastened, carrying the king’s decree. And immediately, the law was posted in Susa, the capital city. While the king and Haman celebrated at a banquet, all the Jews began to mourn and lament.
Esther 4:1 When Mordecai heard all that was happening to the Jewish people, he tore his clothes—a common sign of great distress—put on sackcloth, and sprinkled ashes on his head. Then, in the middle of the city square, he cried out with a loud and bitter voice, making his intense grief and the great bitterness of his soul known to everyone.
Esther 4:2 He went as far as the king's gate, but no further. It was not permitted for anyone dressed in sackcloth, as a sign of mourning, to enter the royal courtyard.
Esther 4:3 In all the provinces, cities, and places where the king’s decree and his command for their destruction had arrived, there was great lamentation among the Jewish people. They engaged in fasting, wailing, and weeping, with many even using sackcloth and ashes as their bedding as a sign of their sorrow and repentance.
Esther 4:4 Then Esther’s young women and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai's public display of mourning. When she heard this, Queen Esther was greatly dismayed and deeply troubled, so she sent him a change of clothes so he could put off the sackcloth. But he refused to accept them.
Esther 4:5 Immediately, Esther summoned Hathach, a eunuch who was assigned to attend her in her personal chambers. She commanded him to go to Mordecai and find out from him why he was doing this public display of grief.
Esther 4:6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai, who was still in the city square near the king’s gate.
Esther 4:7 Mordecai told Hathach everything that had happened, including how Haman had promised to put a vast sum of money into the royal treasury in exchange for the destruction and massacre of the Jewish people.
Esther 4:8 Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the written decree concerning their annihilation, which was posted publicly in Susa. He instructed Hathach to show it to the queen and to urge her to go in to the king and plead for her people, the Jews.
Esther 4:9 Hathach returned to the palace and reported to Esther everything Mordecai had said to him.
Esther 4:10 Esther then replied to Hathach, giving him a message to deliver to Mordecai, saying:
Esther 4:11 "All the king’s servants and all the provinces under his dominion know that for anyone, regardless of gender or age, who enters the king's inner court without being summoned, there is only one fixed sentence: that person shall be put to death. The sole exception is if the king extends his golden scepter to them, allowing them to live. As for me, I have not been summoned to the king for thirty days now, which puts my life in danger if I approach him unbidden."
Esther 4:12 When Mordecai heard this message from Esther, he ordered that she be told in return:
Esther 4:13 "Do not think that because you are in the king’s palace, you alone among all the Jewish people will escape this fate and save your own life."
Esther 4:14 "For if you remain silent at this critical moment—failing to intercede for your people—relief and deliverance for the Jewish people will certainly arise from another source and by another means. However, you and your father’s household will perish for your inaction. And who knows if you have come to your royal position for precisely such a time as this, so that you might help your people and save them from destruction?"
Esther 4:15 Then Esther sent this reply back to Mordecai, saying:
Esther 4:16 "Go, gather all the Jewish people whom you find in Susa, and pray for me. Do not eat or drink for three days and three nights, beginning now. My young women and I will also fast in the same way. After this period of prayer and fasting, I will go in to the king, even though it is strictly against the royal law to do so without being summoned. And if I must perish by breaking this law, then I shall perish."
Esther 4:17 So Mordecai went away and did everything that Queen Esther had commanded him, gathering the Jews for prayer and fasting.
Esther 4:1 Mordecai, having heard all that had happened to the Jewish people, tore his garments. He put on sackcloth, a sign of deep mourning, and sprinkled ashes on his head. He then ran through the city square, up to the king's gate, crying out loudly and wailing in great distress.
Esther 4:2 He went as far as the king's courtyard. He could not enter the royal gate, for no one clothed in sackcloth was permitted to do so.
Esther 4:3 In all the provinces, cities, and places where the king's command and the decree had been proclaimed, there was great weeping, mourning, and wailing among the Jews. Many used sackcloth and ashes as their bed, a sign of extreme sorrow.
Esther 4:4 Esther's maidservants and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai. When she heard this, she was immediately greatly troubled. She sent clothes for him to wear, so he could take off the sackcloth, but he refused to accept them.
Esther 4:5 So Esther summoned Hathach, one of the eunuchs the king had assigned to attend her. She commanded him to go to Mordecai and find out why he was acting this way.
Esther 4:6 Hathach went out to Mordecai, who was standing in the city square in front of the king's gate.
Esther 4:7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened, including how Haman had promised to pay a large sum of money into the king's treasury for the extermination of the Jews.
Esther 4:8 He also gave Hathach a copy of the decree that had been posted in Susa, the capital, so he could show it to the Queen. Mordecai urged her to go to the King and plead with him for her people.
Esther 4:9 When Hathach returned, he reported to Esther everything Mordecai had said.
Esther 4:10 Then Esther instructed Hathach to tell Mordecai in reply:
Esther 4:11 All the king's servants and all the people in the provinces under his rule know this: if any man or woman approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned, there is only one law. They are immediately put to death, unless the king extends his golden scepter to them, allowing them to live. I, however, have not been summoned to the king for thirty days now.
Esther 4:12 When Mordecai heard what Esther had said and reported back to her,
Esther 4:13 He sent back this reply to her: 'Do not imagine that you alone, in the king's house, will escape the fate of all the other Jews.'
Esther 4:14 'For if you remain silent now, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another source. But you and your father's family will perish. Who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?'
Esther 4:15 Esther then sent this message in reply to Mordecai:
Esther 4:16 'Go and gather all the Jews who are in Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maidservants will fast in the same way. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law — and if I perish, I perish.'
Esther 4:17 So Mordecai went and did everything Esther had commanded him.
Esther 4:18 Then Mordecai prayed to the Lord, remembering all the works of the Lord, and said:
Esther 4:19 'O Lord, Lord, Almighty King, all things are in your power, and there is no one who can resist your will if you choose to save Israel.'
Esther 4:20 'You made the universe and the earth, and whatever is contained within the expanse of the sky.'
Esther 4:21 'You are the Lord of all, and there is no one who can resist your majesty.'
Esther 4:22 'And now, O Lord God, King, mighty and powerful, and having all authority and power, all things bow before you and fear your presence.'
Esther 4:23 'And now I implore you, God of Israel, look favorably upon your people and upon the tribulation of the Jews. For they desire to exterminate us and to destroy your heritage.'
Esther 4:24 'Do not despise your portion, the people whom you redeemed from Egypt.'
Esther 4:25 'Hear my prayer, and be merciful to your chosen people and your inheritance. Turn our mourning into joy, so that we who live may praise your name, O Lord, and do not close the mouths of those who sing to you.'
Esther 4:26 All Israel cried out to the Lord with all their heart's desire, for they had been called to imminent death.
Esther 4:27 Queen Esther also took refuge in the Lord, fearing the danger that was hanging over them.
Esther 4:28 She took off her glorious royal garments. She put on clothes of sorrow and mourning. Instead of various perfumes, she poured unclean ashes and dung on her head. She humbled her body by fasting, and she defiled all her hair, which was accustomed to being adorned. She then prayed to the Lord God of Israel, saying:
Esther 4:29 'My Lord, who alone is our King, help me who am alone. I have no other helper but you, for danger is in my hands.'
Esther 4:30 'I have heard from my father that you, O Lord, chose Israel from all the nations. You chose our fathers from among all their ancestors to be your eternal possession, and you did for them according to your will.'
Esther 4:31 'And now we have sinned in your sight, and because of this, you have delivered us into the hands of our enemies.'
Esther 4:32 'Because we worshipped their gods, you are just, O Lord, in punishing us.'
Esther 4:33 'And now it is not enough for them that they oppress us with the harshest servitude. Attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols, they wish to transfer your kingdom, destroy your inheritance, close the mouths of those who praise you, and extinguish the glory of your temple and your altar.'
Esther 4:34 'They do this so that the mouths of the Gentiles may be opened, and they may praise the power of their idols and eternally magnify a fleshly king.'
Esther 4:35 'Do not surrender your scepter, O Lord, to those who are nothing, so that they may not mock our destruction. Instead, turn their counsel back upon themselves and destroy the one who began to rage against us.'
Esther 4:36 'Remember us, O Lord, and reveal yourself to us in the time of our tribulation. Give me courage, O Lord, King of gods and of all power.'
Esther 4:37 'Put a fitting speech in my mouth when I am before the king, the lion, and turn his heart to hatred of the one who attacks us, so that he himself may perish, and those who agree with him.'
Esther 4:38 'But deliver us by your hand, and help me, who am alone and have no other helper but you, O Lord.'
Esther 4:39 'You know everything, and you know that I hate the glory of the wicked. I detest the abomination of the uncircumcised and of every foreigner.'
Esther 4:40 'You know my necessity, that I abhor the symbol of my pride and glory, that is, the tiara which is on my head during my days of public display. I detest it like a defiled cloth, and I do not wear it during my days of quiet prayer and mourning.'
Esther 5:1 On the third day, Queen Esther put on her royal robes, and she went to stand in the inner courtyard of the king’s palace. This courtyard was in front of the palace’s entrance hall. The King was seated on his royal throne inside the palace, directly opposite the entrance.
Esther 5:2 When the king saw Queen Esther standing there, her appearance pleased him. So he extended the golden scepter he held in his hand toward her. She then approached him and kissed the very tip of the scepter.
Esther 5:3 The King said to her: "What do you want, Queen Esther? What is your request? Whatever it is, even if it’s half of my kingdom, you will receive it."
Esther 5:4 She replied: "If it pleases the King, please come, O King, and bring Haman with you today to the banquet I have prepared."
Esther 5:5 Immediately the King commanded: "Quickly, call Haman, so that he may fulfill the Queen’s wish." So the King and Haman came to the banquet that Queen Esther had prepared for them.
Esther 5:6 After the King had already drunk some wine, he said to Queen Esther: "What do you request, so that it may be given to you? What do you wish to be done? Even if you ask for half of my kingdom, you shall have it."
Esther 5:7 Queen Esther replied: "My request and my plea are these:"
Esther 5:8 "If I have found favor in the King’s eyes, and if it pleases the King to grant what I ask and to fulfill my request, then let the King and Haman come to the banquet I have prepared for them. And tomorrow, I will do as I have done today—preparing another banquet and continuing to delay my true petition."
Esther 5:9 So Haman left that day joyful and in good spirits. But when he saw Mordecai sitting at the palace gate, and observed that Mordecai neither stood up for him nor even moved from his seat, Haman became extremely angry.
Esther 5:10 So he returned to his home and immediately called together his friends and his wife, Zeresh.
Esther 5:11 He boasted to them about the vast extent of his riches, the multitude of his sons, and how greatly the King had honored him, elevating him above all the other officials and servants.
Esther 5:12 And after all this, he added: "Queen Esther invited no one else to the King’s banquet but me! And what’s more, for tomorrow, she is prepared to have the King and me come again for another banquet!"
Esther 5:13 "But all these honors mean nothing to me," he declared, "as often as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the royal gate."
Esther 5:14 His wife Zeresh and all his other friends replied to him: "Order a very tall gallows, fifty cubits high, to be prepared. Then, in the morning, speak to the King so that Mordecai may be hanged upon it. After that, you can go joyfully with the King to the banquet." This advice pleased Haman, and he ordered a very tall gallows to be made.
Esther 6:1 That night, the king couldn't sleep. He ordered that the royal records, containing stories and chronicles from earlier times, be brought to him. As they were being read aloud in his presence,
Esther 6:2 they came to a place in the records where it was written how Mordecai had revealed the plot of Bagathan and Thares, two of the king's eunuchs who had wanted to kill the king.
Esther 6:3 The king asked, "What honor or reward has Mordecai received for this act of loyalty?" His servants and ministers replied, "He has received absolutely nothing."
Esther 6:4 Immediately the king asked, "Who is in the courtyard right now?" At that very moment, Haman had entered the outer courtyard of the royal palace to suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on the gallows that Haman had prepared for him.
Esther 6:5 The king's servants answered, "Haman is standing in the courtyard." And the king said, "Let him come in."
Esther 6:6 When Haman had come in, the king asked him, "What should be done for a man whom the king wishes to honor?" Haman, thinking to himself and not suspecting that anyone else but himself would be worthy of such honor,
Esther 6:7 answered, "For the man whom the king wishes to honor,
Esther 6:8 he should be dressed in the royal robe that the king himself has worn, and be mounted on the horse that the king himself rides, and have a royal diadem placed upon his head.
Esther 6:9 Then, one of the king's noblest princes and leading officials should hold his horse, and as he walks through the city square, he should proclaim and say: 'Thus shall the man be honored, whom the king desires to honor!'
Esther 6:10 The king then said to Haman, "Hurry! Take the royal robe and the horse, and do exactly as you have said for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the palace gate. Be careful not to omit anything you have spoken."
Esther 6:11 So Haman took the royal robe and the horse. He dressed Mordecai and placed him upon the horse. Then Haman went ahead of him through the city square, shouting, "This is the honor fitting for the man whom the king desires to honor!"
Esther 6:12 Mordecai then returned to the palace gate. Haman hurried home, grieving and with his head covered in shame.
Esther 6:13 He told Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends everything that had happened to him. The wise men he had for counsel, and his wife Zeresh, answered him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not be able to stand against him; instead, you will surely fall before him."
Esther 6:14 While they were still speaking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and quickly compelled Haman to come to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
Esther 7:1 So the king and Haman came to drink with Queen Esther.
Esther 7:2 And on the second day, when the king was warm from the wine, he said to her: "Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be granted to you, and whatever you wish will be done for you."
Esther 7:3 She answered him: "If I have found favor in your eyes, O King, and if it pleases you, grant me my life, for which I ask, and spare my people, for whom I beg."
Esther 7:4 For my people and I have been delivered up to be utterly crushed, killed, and destroyed. If we had only been sold as slaves and handmaidens, the evil would have been tolerable, and I would not have troubled the king for such a small matter. But now our enemy is one whose cruelty will also harm the king.
Esther 7:5 King Ahasuerus replied, saying: "Who is this man, and by whose authority does he dare to do such things?"
Esther 7:6 And Esther said: "Our enemy and adversary is this most wicked Haman!" When Haman heard this, he was utterly disturbed, and his face fell completely at what the king and queen had spoken.
Esther 7:7 The king, enraged, rose from the banquet and went into the garden, which had been designed with many different kinds of trees and plantings. Haman also rose to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he understood that the king had already prepared evil for him.
Esther 7:8 When the king returned from the wooded garden and entered the banquet hall, Haman was lying on the couch where the queen was reclining. And the king said: "Does he even intend to oppress the queen in my presence, in my own house?" The words had barely left the king's mouth when they immediately covered Haman's face.
Esther 7:9 Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs who attended the king, said: "Look, the gallows that Haman prepared for Mordecai, who spoke up for the king, stands in Haman's house. It is fifty cubits high." To this, the king said: "Hang Haman upon it!"
Esther 7:10 So Haman was hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. And the king's anger was appeased.
Esther 8:1 That day, King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai was brought before the king, because Esther had explained that Mordecai was her relative and guardian.
Esther 8:2 The king then took back his signet ring, which he had ordered to be taken from Haman, and he gave it to Mordecai, giving him authority. And Queen Esther appointed Mordecai to manage the entire estate of Haman.
Esther 8:3 But Esther was not content with only these things. She fell at the king’s feet, weeping, and she pleaded with him, asking that he would void Haman the Agagite’s wickedness and the very evil schemes he had devised against the Jewish people.
Esther 8:4 So the king extended his golden scepter towards Esther, which was the sign that she was allowed to approach him and speak without fear of punishment. She immediately rose and stood before him.
Esther 8:5 And she said, "If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and if this matter seems right to me, and if it is acceptable to the king, I beg that by new decrees, the former letters of Haman—that most wicked destroyer of the Jews in all the king's provinces—be ordered to be amended, or corrected."
Esther 8:6 "For how can I endure to see the destruction of my people and the slaughter of my relatives?"
Esther 8:7 King Ahasuerus then responded to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, saying, "I have already granted Haman’s property to Esther, and I ordered Haman himself to be hanged on the gallows because he dared to attack the Jews."
Esther 8:8 "Therefore, write new decrees to the Jews as you please, in my name, and seal them with my royal signet ring. For it was the custom that no one dared to contradict the king's official decrees once they were sealed with his ring, making them unchangeable."
Esther 8:9 So the king's scribes and secretaries were called immediately. It was the twenty-third day of the third month, which is called Sivan. And letters were written exactly as Mordecai desired: to the Jewish people, and to the satraps, governors, and judges who ruled over the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India to Ethiopia. The letters were sent to each province and each people according to their languages and customs, and specifically to the Jews, so they could all read and understand the decree.
Esther 8:10 Mordecai himself also wrote the decrees in the king’s name and sealed them with the king’s signet ring. He then sent the letters by swift couriers and royal horsemen who were official messengers of the king.
Esther 8:11 To these messengers, Mordecai gave the command that they should go to the Jewish people in all the provinces and permit them to gather together to stand up and defend their lives. They were also permitted to kill all their enemies—including their wives and children—and to utterly destroy everything that threatened them, even to the point of extermination, and to take their possessions as plunder. This decree allowed the Jews to defend themselves with the same power that Haman's decree had granted their enemies.
Esther 8:12 And one specific day was appointed throughout all the provinces in the entire empire of King Ahasuerus for this defense: the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar. This was the same day that Haman had originally chosen for their destruction.
Esther 8:13 Therefore, a copy of the decree was to be published in all provinces and made known to all peoples, so that the Jews would be prepared for the day they could defend themselves against their enemies.
Esther 8:14 And the swift couriers, who were sent by the king's command, went out immediately. The decree was publicly posted without delay in the city of Susa.
Esther 8:15 But Mordecai, having left the king's palace and his immediate presence, was dressed in royal robes of purple and blue, wearing a golden crown, and clothed in cloaks of fine linen and scarlet. These were all symbols of his new, high honor and authority. And the entire city of Susa rejoiced and was glad at this change in fortune.
Esther 8:16 For the Jewish people, a new light of hope had dawned. There was joy, exultation, and great honor for them.
Esther 8:17 And in all the provinces and cities where the king's command and decree had arrived, the Jewish people celebrated with feasts, joy, banquets, and a day of festival. Many of the peoples of the land, seeing this turn of events, converted and joined their sect and religion, for the fear and respect for the Jewish people had now fallen upon all.
Esther 9:1 On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, called the month of Adar, when the extermination of all the Jews had been planned, and their enemies were eager for their blood, the Jews, instead, became the victors and took vengeance on their adversaries.
Esther 9:2 The Jews gathered in every city, town, and village to defend themselves and to kill their enemies and persecutors. No one dared to resist them, because terror had gripped the hearts of all people.
Esther 9:3 Indeed, the judges of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and every dignitary who presided over individual places honored the Jews, because the fear of Mordechai had fallen upon them.
Esther 9:4 For Mordechai was powerful in the palace, and the fame of his name had spread throughout all the provinces; for everyone announced that Mordechai's people were mighty.
Esther 9:5 So the Jews struck all their enemies with a great slaughter, killing them and giving back to them what they had intended for the Jews.
Esther 9:6 Also, in the city of Susa, the Jews killed five hundred men.
Esther 9:7 And Pharsandatha, Dalphon, and Aspatha,
Esther 9:8 and Poratha, Adalia, and Aridatha,
Esther 9:9 and Parmastha, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha—
Esther 9:10 these were the ten sons of Haman, son of Hammedatha, the adversary of the Jews, whom they killed. But they did not take their plunder.
Esther 9:11 The number of those killed in Susa was immediately reported to the king.
Esther 9:12 The king then said to Queen Esther, "In the city of Susa, the Jews have killed five hundred men, including Haman's ten sons. How great a slaughter do you think they have carried out in all the other provinces? What more do you request, and what else do you want me to command to be done?"
Esther 9:13 Esther replied, "If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews in Susa that they may act tomorrow just as they have acted today. And let Haman's ten sons be hanged on gallows."
Esther 9:14 And the king commanded that it should be done. Immediately, the king's decree was proclaimed in Susa, and Haman's ten sons were hanged.
Esther 9:15 The Jews in Susa also continued on the fifteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred more men, but they did not take their plunder.
Esther 9:16 But the Jews who lived in the other provinces gathered to defend their lives and to pursue their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them, and they touched none of their possessions.
Esther 9:17 All these things were done on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. On the fourteenth day of the same month, they ceased all killing and dedicated themselves to feasting and rejoicing.
Esther 9:18 However, those who had carried out the killing in Susa fought both on the thirteenth and the fifteenth days of the month of Adar; they ceased on the fifteenth. Therefore, it has been observed by the Jews who lived in the walled towns that they should appoint the fourteenth day of Adar as a day of joy and feasting,
Esther 9:19 and a festive day on which they send portions of food to one another. But those who are in unwalled cities and in villages decree the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, so that they may be joyful in their celebrations and send food to one another.
Esther 9:20 So Mordechai wrote down all these things and sent letters to all the Jews who lived in all the provinces of King Artaxerxes, both near and far,
Esther 9:21 that they should establish the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar as annual festive days for themselves.
Esther 9:22 This was because on those days, the Jews had been avenged on their enemies, and their sorrow and sadness had been turned into joy and gladness. They were to make them days of feasting and rejoicing, and to send portions of food to one another, and to give alms to the poor and needy.
Esther 9:23 And the Jews took into custom all that they had begun to do and all that Mordechai had written to them.
Esther 9:24 This was because Haman, son of Hammedatha, of the race of Agag, the adversary and enemy of the Jews, had plotted evil against them to kill and destroy them; and he had cast "pur," which means "the lot."
Esther 9:25 And afterwards, when he had gone in to the king to order the Jews to perish, Esther interceded with the king. And by the king's decision, it was commanded that Haman's wicked scheme, which he had devised against the Jews through his letters and malice, should recoil upon his own head and the heads of his sons, and that he and his offspring should be hanged on gallows.
Esther 9:26 And from that time, these days were called Purim, that is, "of Lots," because "pur," that is, "the lot," had been cast. And all that had happened, and what then occurred,
Esther 9:27 the Jews resolved for themselves, and for their descendants, and for all who wished to join them, that no one should be permitted to transgress, and that they should keep these festive days as an everlasting observance for themselves from generation to generation.
Esther 9:28 These days were to be remembered and solemnized throughout the entire world, by individual families, and cities, and provinces. No festive day was to be allowed to fall into disuse, but rather to be continually renewed with celebration.
Esther 9:29 Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, and Mordechai the Jew, then wrote with all their authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.
Esther 9:30 And they sent words of peace and truth to all the Jews who were in the one hundred twenty-seven provinces of King Artaxerxes,
Esther 9:31 and commanded that the days of the Lots should be observed and celebrated at their appointed time, just as Mordechai the Jew and Queen Esther had established, and as they themselves had ordained for themselves and their descendants, with fasting, lamentation, and rejoicing.
Esther 9:32 And all things pertaining to Purim are contained in one volume, and the authenticity of that command has been proven.
Esther 10:1 King Ahasuerus then issued a decree for a tax throughout his entire kingdom and extending even to the farthest islands.
Esther 10:2 All the accomplishments of his reign, his mighty acts, his imperial glory, and the powerful position to which he elevated Mordecai, are recorded in the official chronicles of the kingdoms of Media and Persia.
Esther 10:3 And how Mordecai, a Jew, became the second highest authority after King Ahasuerus; he was greatly respected among his own people, the Jews, and was highly esteemed by all his kinsmen, always working for the welfare of his people and speaking words that served the benefit of many.
Job 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz named Job. That man was innocent in his heart, righteous in his deeds, reverent toward God, and always turned away from evil.
Job 1:2 To him were born seven sons and three daughters.
Job 1:3 His possessions included seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yokes of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys. He also had a very numerous household of servants. That man was the greatest of all the people of the East.
Job 1:4 His sons would go and hold feasts in their own houses, each on his designated day. They would send for their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
Job 1:5 When the cycle of feasting days had passed, Job would send for his children and purify them. Rising early in the morning, he would offer a burnt offering for each of them. He would say to himself, "Perhaps my sons have sinned and inwardly renounced God in their hearts." Job did this continually.
Job 1:6 Now on a certain day, when the sons of God — the angelic beings — came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan also came among them.
Job 1:7 The Lord said to him, "Where have you come from?" And Satan answered, "I have traveled throughout the earth, walking to and fro across it."
Job 1:8 The Lord then said to him, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth, a man innocent in his heart and righteous in his deeds, reverent toward God, and always turning away from evil."
Job 1:9 Satan answered the Lord, "Does Job fear God for nothing? Is there no gain for him in it?"
Job 1:10 "Have You not hedged him in —protected him — and his house, and all his possessions on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his wealth has increased on the earth.
Job 1:11 But stretch out Your hand a little and touch all that he possesses, and see if he will not curse You to Your face."
Job 1:12 Then the Lord said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only do not lay a hand on him personally." So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.
Job 1:13 Now on a certain day, when Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother,
Job 1:14 a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys were grazing beside them,
Job 1:15 when the Sabeans raided, took them all, and killed the servants with the sword. I alone have escaped to tell you."
Job 1:16 While he was still speaking, behold, another messenger came and said, "Fire from the sky —sent by God— fell and burned up the sheep, and consumed the servants. I alone have escaped to tell you."
Job 1:17 While he was still speaking, another entered and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties, attacked the camels, and took them. They also killed the servants with the sword. I alone have escaped to tell you."
Job 1:18 While he was still speaking, behold, another messenger came in and said, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother.
Job 1:19 Then suddenly a violent wind burst in from the desert, struck the four corners of the house, and it collapsed, crushing your children, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you."
Job 1:20 Then Job arose, tore his clothes as a sign of mourning, shaved his head, and falling to the ground, he worshipped.
Job 1:21 He said, "I came out naked from my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there, to the earth. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away. As it pleased the Lord, so it has happened. May the name of the Lord be blessed."
Job 1:22 In all these things, Job did not sin with his lips, nor did he speak anything foolish against God.
Job 2:1 Again, on a certain day, when God's holy angels came to serve before the Lord in His heavenly court, Satan also came among them, standing in the Lord's presence.
Job 2:2 And the Lord said to Satan, "Where do you come from?" Satan answered, "I have been circling the earth, and I have walked throughout it."
Job 2:3 And the Lord said to Satan, "Have you truly considered My servant Job, that there is no one like him on earth—a simple and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds onto his integrity, even though you provoked Me against him to afflict him without cause."
Job 2:4 Satan answered Him, saying, "Skin for skin! A man will give everything he owns to save his own life."
Job 2:5 "But stretch out Your hand a little bit and strike his bone and his flesh, and then You will see if he curses You to Your face."
Job 2:6 So the Lord said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your power. However, you must spare his life."
Job 2:7 So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and struck Job with painful boils and festering sores, from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.
Job 2:8 Job sat among the ashes and used a broken piece of pottery to scrape his sores.
Job 2:9 And his wife said to him, "Are you still clinging to your integrity? Curse God and die!"
Job 2:10 But Job said to her, "You are speaking like one of the foolish women. If we accept good things from the hand of God, why should we not also accept difficult things?" In all these trials, Job did not sin with his lips.
Job 2:11 Now, when Job's three friends heard about all the evil that had come upon him, they came, each from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They had agreed to come together to visit him and to console him.
Job 2:12 And when they lifted their eyes from a distance, they did not recognize him because of his disfigurement. They cried out and wept, tearing their garments, and they sprinkled dust over their heads toward the sky as a sign of their deep grief.
Job 2:13 And they sat with him on the ground for seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very intense.
Job 2:14 After all this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born.
Job 2:15 And he spoke these words:
Job 2:16 "Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night in which it was announced: 'A man has been conceived!'"
Job 2:17 "Let that day turn into darkness. Let God above not seek it out, and let no light illuminate it."
Job 2:18 "Let deep darkness and the shadow of death obscure that day. Let a thick cloud settle upon it, and let it be enveloped in bitterness."
Job 2:19 "Let a dark storm seize that night. Let it not be counted among the days of the year, nor included in the number of the months."
Job 2:20 "Let that night be solitary and not worthy of praise among the number of the months."
Job 2:21 "Let those who curse the day curse it—those sorcerers who are ready to rouse Leviathan."
Job 2:22 "Let its stars be darkened by its gloom. Let it wait for light but not see it, nor the rising of the dawn."
Job 2:23 "Because it did not close the doors of the womb from which I came, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes."
Job 2:24 "Why did I not die in the womb? Why did I not perish as soon as I came out of the belly?"
Job 2:25 "Why was I received upon knees? Why was I nursed at breasts?"
Job 2:26 "For now, I would lie down and be silent. I would sleep and be at peace, restored by rest."
Job 2:27 "With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places and monuments for themselves."
Job 2:28 "Or with princes who possessed gold and filled their houses with silver."
Job 2:29 "Or like a hidden, stillborn child, I would not exist; or like those who were conceived but never saw the light of day."
Job 2:30 "There, in that place of rest, the wicked cease from their raging, and those who were exhausted in strength find peace."
Job 2:31 "And those who were once bound together, without any trouble, no longer hear the voice of the oppressor."
Job 2:32 "The small and the great are there alike, and the slave is free from his master."
Job 2:33 "Why is light given to the miserable, and life to those who are bitter in spirit?"
Job 2:34 "Who long for death, but it does not come, and they search for it more eagerly than for hidden treasures."
Job 2:35 "They rejoice greatly when they find the grave."
Job 2:36 "Why is life given to a man whose path is hidden, and whom God has surrounded with darkness?"
Job 2:37 "Before I eat, I sigh, and my groans pour out like flowing waters."
Job 2:38 "For the very fear that I feared has come upon me, and what I dreaded has happened."
Job 2:39 "I did not pretend to be calm, nor was I silent, nor did I find rest; yet, anger and suffering still came upon me."
Job 2:40 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Job 3:1 After everything that had happened, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
Job 3:2 Then Job spoke, and said:
Job 3:3 Let the day I was born completely vanish. And let the night also vanish when it was announced: 'A man has been conceived!'
Job 3:4 May that day turn into total darkness. May God above not look upon it or care about it, and may it never be brightened by any light.
Job 3:5 Let shadows and the deepest gloom of death obscure it. Let thick fog and bitterness completely overwhelm it.
Job 3:6 Let a dark storm claim that night as its own. May it not be counted among the days of the year, nor included in the months.
Job 3:7 May that night be utterly desolate and solitary. May it never be a night for rejoicing or praise.
Job 3:8 Let those who curse days, those who are ready to rouse the great sea monster Leviathan, curse that night.
Job 3:9 Let its morning stars be obscured by its gloom. May it long for light but never see it, nor the dawning of the rising sun.
Job 3:10 Because that night did not seal the doors of the womb that carried me, nor did it keep sorrow and misfortune from my eyes.
Job 3:11 Why was I not stillborn in the womb? Why did I not perish immediately upon leaving my mother's body?
Job 3:12 Why was I received upon knees? Why was I nursed at the breast?
Job 3:13 For now, I would be lying in silent sleep. I would be refreshed by slumber, and I would be at peace.
Job 3:14 I would be at rest with kings and the great leaders of the earth, who built desolate ruins for themselves as tombs.
Job 3:15 Or with princes who possessed gold and filled their houses with silver, all now in their tombs.
Job 3:16 Or, like a hidden miscarriage, I would not even exist. I would be like infants who were conceived but never saw the light of day.
Job 3:17 In the grave, the wicked cease from their raging tumult, and those who are exhausted from their strength finally rest.
Job 3:18 There, even prisoners who were once bound lie together without any trouble. They do not hear the voice of their taskmaster anymore.
Job 3:19 Both the insignificant and the powerful are there, and the servant is finally free from his master.
Job 3:20 Why is light given to the miserable? And why is life given to those who live in such bitterness of soul?
Job 3:21 They long for death, but it does not come. They search for it more eagerly than for hidden treasures.
Job 3:22 They rejoice exceedingly when they finally find the grave.
Job 3:23 Why is life given to a man whose path is hidden, a man whom God has surrounded with darkness and despair?
Job 3:24 Before I eat, I sigh; and my groans pour out like overflowing waters.
Job 3:25 For the very terror I feared has come upon me, and what I dreaded has happened.
Job 3:26 I have not found peace, nor quiet, nor rest. Instead, only torment and anger have come upon me.
Job 4:1 But Eliphaz, the man from Teman, spoke, responding to what Job had said:
Job 4:2 If we were to begin speaking to you, perhaps you would take it badly. But who can possibly hold back the words that have formed in his mind?
Job 4:3 Look, you yourself have instructed many people, and you have given strength to those whose hands were weak.
Job 4:4 Your words have stabilized those who were wavering, and you have strengthened trembling knees.
Job 4:5 But now a calamity has come upon you, and you have become weak. It has touched you, and you are deeply troubled.
Job 4:6 Was not your reverence for God your confidence? And your hope, the blamelessness of your ways?
Job 4:7 Please remember this: Has any innocent person ever perished? Or when have the upright ever been destroyed?
Job 4:8 On the contrary, I have seen that those who practice wickedness, and sow seeds of trouble, eventually reap those same troubles.
Job 4:9 They perish by the very breath of God, and they are consumed by the spirit of His anger.
Job 4:10 The roaring of the lion, and the cry of the lioness, and the teeth of the young lions, are all broken.
Job 4:11 The tiger perishes because it has no prey, and the young lions are scattered.
Job 4:12 Moreover, a word was secretly revealed to me, and my ear caught its whisper as if by stealth.
Job 4:13 In the terror of a vision by night, when deep sleep usually overtakes people,
Job 4:14 fear and trembling seized me, and all my bones were terrified.
Job 4:15 And when a spirit passed right before me, the hairs of my body stood on end.
Job 4:16 Someone stood there, whose face I could not recognize; only an outline was before my eyes, and then I heard a voice like a soft whisper.
Job 4:17 Can a mortal man be considered righteous in comparison with God? Or can a man be pure before his Maker?
Job 4:18 Look, those who serve Him are not steadfast, and He finds fault even in His Angels.
Job 4:19 How much more, then, will those who live in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the earth, be consumed like a moth?
Job 4:20 From morning until evening, they are cut down. And because no one understands their plight, they perish forever.
Job 4:21 Those who lived with them are utterly cut off from their very being; they die, and not in wisdom.
Job 4:22 Cry out, if there is anyone who will answer you! And turn to any of the holy ones for help.
Job 4:23 Truly, wrath slays the foolish, and resentment kills a man.
Job 4:24 I myself have seen a foolish man taking root, but immediately I cursed his prosperity.
Job 4:25 May his home be without children, and may his children be plundered.
Job 4:26 May his children suckle on poverty, and may they be driven out of their homes.
Job 4:27 May hunger mock his riches, and may an armed man drag him away.
Job 4:28 May his own small field not yield its fruit, and may the thirsty consume his possessions.
Job 4:29 Indeed, wickedness does not spring up from the earth, and sorrow does not grow out of the ground.
Job 4:30 Man is born for labor, just as a bird is born for flight.
Job 4:31 For this reason, I will call upon the Lord, and I will present my case to God.
Job 4:32 He is the One who does great and unsearchable things, and wonders beyond counting.
Job 4:33 He is the One who sends rain upon the face of the earth, and waters all living things with moisture.
Job 4:34 He is the One who sets the humble on high, and lifts up those who mourn into security and wellbeing.
Job 4:35 He is the One who thwarts the schemes of the malicious, so that they cannot achieve their full intent.
Job 4:36 He is the One who catches the cunning in their own craftiness, and scatters the plans of the perverse.
Job 4:37 They grope about in daylight, yet there is no light for them; they stumble at noon as if in the deepest night.
Job 4:38 He saves the poor from the sharp words of their mouths, and from the hand of the violent man.
Job 4:39 And so there will be hope for the poor, and wickedness will be silenced.
Job 4:40 Blessed is the man whom God corrects. Therefore, do not reject the rebuke of the Most High.
Job 5:1 Go ahead and call out, if there is anyone at all who will answer your pleas, or if any of the holy ones—be they angels or righteous men—will agree with you.
Job 5:2 Truly, uncontrolled anger destroys the foolish man, and envy is deadly to the simple-minded.
Job 5:3 I have seen a foolish man firmly established, and I immediately pronounced a curse upon his home.
Job 5:4 His children will be far from any help or safety, and they will be crushed in the city gate—the place of judgment—with no one to rescue them.
Job 5:5 The hungry will eat his harvest, even snatching it from among thorns, and the thirsty will consume all his wealth.
Job 5:6 Nothing happens on earth without a reason, and pain does not simply arise from the ground without a cause, as if it were a plant.
Job 5:7 For man is born to toil, just as a bird is born to fly.
Job 5:8 Because of this truth, I will appeal to the Lord, and I will present my case before God.
Job 5:9 He is the One who does great and unsearchable things, wonders beyond all counting.
Job 5:10 He is the One who sends rain upon the face of the land and waters all things with refreshing water.
Job 5:11 He is the One who sets the humble in high places, and raises those who mourn to a state of security and well-being.
Job 5:12 He is the One who frustrates the plans of malicious men, so that they cannot achieve their desires or speak boastfully of their success.
Job 5:13 He is the One who traps the cunning in their own craftiness, and He brings to nothing the plans of the twisted-minded.
Job 5:14 During the day, they will encounter darkness, and even at high noon, they will grope about as if it were the dead of night.
Job 5:15 But He will save the poor from the grasp of death, and He will deliver the needy from the hand of the violent oppressor.
Job 5:16 And so there will be hope for the poor, while injustice will be silenced.
Job 5:17 Blessed is the man whom God corrects; therefore, do not despise the discipline of the Most High God.
Job 5:18 For He Himself inflicts the wound, and then He heals it; He strikes, and His hands alone bring restoration.
Job 5:19 Through six troubles, He will deliver you, and in the seventh, no evil will even touch you.
Job 5:20 In times of famine, He will deliver you from death itself, and in war, He will save you from the power of the sword.
Job 5:21 You will be hidden from the scourge of slanderous tongues, and you will not fear devastation when it arrives.
Job 5:22 You will laugh at devastation and famine, and you will not dread the wild beasts of the land.
Job 5:23 For you will have a covenant relationship even with the stones of the field, and the wild animals of the earth will be at peace with you.
Job 5:24 And you will know that peace resides in your dwelling place, and when you inspect your flock, you will find nothing missing or amiss.
Job 5:25 And you will know that your descendants will be numerous, and your offspring like the abundant grass of the earth.
Job 5:26 You will come to your grave in ripe old age, just as a shock of grain is gathered in its proper season.
Job 5:27 Behold, this is what we have diligently researched, and it is truly so: what you have heard, write it down and keep it for yourself.
Job 6:1 But Job responded and said:
Job 6:2 Oh, if only my wrongdoing could be weighed on a scale, that wrongdoing for which I have deserved God’s wrath, and if only the suffering I am enduring could be weighed alongside it!
Job 6:3 My suffering would appear heavier than the sand of the sea: that is why my words are full of pain.
Job 6:4 For the arrows of the Lord are within me, and His indignation has consumed my spirit, and the terrors sent by the Lord wage war against me.
Job 6:5 Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass? Or does the ox bellow when it stands before a full manger?
Job 6:6 Can something tasteless be eaten, something not seasoned with salt? Can a bitter thing be swallowed without disgust, once it has been tasted?
Job 6:7 Things which my soul previously refused to touch, now I am forced to eat because of my distress.
Job 6:8 Who will grant that my request might come to me, and that God might grant me what I await?
Job 6:9 And that God might begin to crush me, that He might release His hand and cut me off?
Job 6:10 And let this be my consolation: that in afflicting me with pain, He may not spare me, nor will I contradict the words of the Holy One.
Job 6:11 For what strength do I have to endure this? Or what end do I have to act with patience?
Job 6:12 Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze?
Job 6:13 Truly, there is no help for me within myself, and even my capability has departed from me.
Job 6:14 He who withholds mercy from his friend abandons the fear of the Lord.
Job 6:15 My brothers have deceived me like a wadi, a seasonal stream that flows through valleys.
Job 6:16 They swell with dark waters from the melting snow, where snow is hidden within them.
Job 6:17 In the time when they disperse their waters, they dry up, and when the heat comes, they vanish from their place.
Job 6:18 Their paths twist into crooked ways, they turn off into nothingness, and they perish.
Job 6:19 The caravans from Tema looked for their paths, and the travelers from Sheba waited expectantly for water.
Job 6:20 They were confused and ashamed because they had hoped; they came to the wadi’s location and were covered with disappointment.
Job 6:21 Now you have become nothing to me; seeing my affliction, you are terrified.
Job 6:22 Have I ever said: 'Bring something to me, and endow me from your possessions?'
Job 6:23 Or: 'Deliver me from the hand of my enemy, and redeem me from the hand of the powerful?'
Job 6:24 Teach me, and I will be silent; and if by chance I have been ignorant of anything, instruct me.
Job 6:25 Why have you undermined the words of truth, when among you there is no one who can argue a point effectively?
Job 6:26 Do you only prepare speeches for rebuking, and do you utter words into the wind?
Job 6:27 You even attack an orphan, and you overthrow your friend.
Job 6:28 Turn back, and consider; I will see if I lie.
Job 6:29 At least respond, lest there be iniquity; and acknowledge what is just when you speak.
Job 6:30 Is there iniquity on my tongue? Or can it not be discerned if there is harshness in my understanding?
Job 7:1 Is not the life of man on earth a perpetual struggle, like a soldier's deployment? And are not his days exactly like the days of a hired worker, who anxiously waits for the end of his shift and his payment?
Job 7:2 Just as a slave desires the shade from the scorching sun, and just as a hired hand longs for the completion of his work,
Job 7:3 So too have I endured empty months without relief, and I have counted for myself many nights of painful labor and suffering.
Job 7:4 If I try to sleep, I ask myself, 'When will I rise again?' And then I anxiously await the evening, only to be filled with even more sorrows.
Job 7:5 My flesh is covered with putrefaction and with filthy dust, as my skin becomes dry and wastes away.
Job 7:6 My days have passed more swiftly than a weaver’s shuttle is cut from the loom, and they are consumed without any hope for betterment.
Job 7:7 Remember, O God, that my life is but a fleeting breath of wind, and my eyes will never return to see any good thing.
Job 7:8 Nor will the gaze of any human see me again. Your eyes will search for me, but I will no longer exist.
Job 7:9 Just as a cloud is consumed and passes away, so too will he who descends to the underworld never ascend back to this life.
Job 7:10 He will not return again to his own house, nor will his place on earth know him any longer.
Job 7:11 Therefore, I will not hold back my words. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will pour out my bitterness of soul.
Job 7:12 Am I the tumultuous sea, or a monstrous sea creature, that You should confine me with such a barrier and restrain me?
Job 7:13 If I say, 'My bed will comfort me, I will find relief speaking to myself on my couch and finding peace there,'
Job 7:14 You, O God, terrorize me through dreams, and You shake me with horror through terrifying visions.
Job 7:15 Because of this, my soul has chosen strangulation, and death rather than to continue living in such torment.
Job 7:16 I have despaired, and I no longer wish to live. Leave me alone, for my days are nothing of value.
Job 7:17 What is man, that You should magnify him with such attention? Or why do You set Your heart upon him with such scrutiny?
Job 7:18 You visit him every morning, and You test him suddenly, without warning?
Job 7:19 How long will You not spare me, nor leave me alone long enough to even swallow my saliva and catch my breath?
Job 7:20 I have sinned; what can I do to You, O Guardian of men? Why have You made me Your target, and why have I become a burden to myself?
Job 7:21 Why do You not take away my sin? And why do You not remove my iniquity? For behold, now I will sleep in the dust, and if You search for me in the morning, I will no longer be there.
Job 8:1 And then Bildad the Shuhite replied and said:
Job 8:2 How long will you speak such things? The words coming from your mouth are like a strong, destructive whirlwind, like a storm!
Job 8:3 Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty ever twist what is right?
Job 8:4 If your sons sinned against Him, then He surely delivered them over to the consequences of their sin.
Job 8:5 But if you would sincerely seek God early in the morning, and implore the Almighty for mercy:
Job 8:6 if you are pure and upright, then He would immediately awaken to your plight, and restore the peaceful dwelling of your righteousness.
Job 8:7 And even if your beginnings were humble, in the end, your prosperity will be greatly multiplied.
Job 8:8 For inquire of the generations of old, and diligently examine the wisdom passed down by the fathers:
Job 8:9 For we are only of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are like a passing shadow.
Job 8:10 Will they not themselves teach you, and speak to you their wisdom? And from their hearts bring forth wise sayings?
Job 8:11 Can papyrus grow tall without water? Or can reeds flourish without marshy ground?
Job 8:12 Even while still in its bloom, before it can dry out—before any plant can be cut—it withers away sooner than all other plants.
Job 8:13 Such is the fate of all who forget God, and the hope of the godless will perish.
Job 8:14 Whose confidence is like a fragile net, and whose trust is like a spider's web.
Job 8:15 He leans on his house, but it will not stand; he props it up, but it will not hold firm.
Job 8:16 He seems fresh and green before the sun comes, and his branches sprout vigorously in his garden;
Job 8:17 his roots spread out over a heap of stones, and entwine themselves among the rocks.
Job 8:18 If he is uprooted from his place, then the place itself will deny him, saying, 'I do not know you!'
Job 8:19 Behold, such is the fleeting joy of his existence; and from his very ground, another will arise.
Job 8:20 For God will not reject a blameless person, nor will He uphold the hand of evildoers.
Job 8:21 Until He fills your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouts of joy.
Job 8:22 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the dwelling of the impious will cease to exist.
Job 9:1 Job then answered and said:
Job 9:2 Truly, I know that this is the truth—no mortal man can be justified when compared to God.
Job 9:3 If God wishes to argue against a man, the man will not be able to answer even one in a thousand points God raises.
Job 9:4 God is wise in heart, and mighty in strength. Who has ever resisted Him and found peace afterward?
Job 9:5 He is the One who moves mountains, and those whom He overturns in His fury do not even perceive it happening.
Job 9:6 He is the One who shakes the earth from its foundations, and its very pillars tremble.
Job 9:7 He commands the sun, and it does not rise. He seals up the stars as if they are under His control.
Job 9:8 He alone spreads out the universe, and He walks upon the waves of the sea.
Job 9:9 He made the constellations Arcturus, Orion, and the Hyades, and also the hidden southern constellations.
Job 9:10 He performs great deeds that cannot be understood, and wonders that are beyond counting.
Job 9:11 If He comes to me, I will not see Him. If He passes by, I will not comprehend it.
Job 9:12 If He suddenly snatches something away, who can stop Him? Or who can say to Him: 'Why do You do this?'
Job 9:13 God, whose wrath no one can resist, is the One before whom even the cosmic powers that hold up the world bend.
Job 9:14 How then can I be great enough to answer Him, or to speak my own words in debate with Him?
Job 9:15 Even if I possessed some righteousness, I would not answer Him. Instead, I would implore my Judge for mercy.
Job 9:16 And even if I were to call upon Him and He heard me, I would not believe that He was actually speaking to me.
Job 9:17 For He would crush me with a storm, and multiply my wounds without any discernible cause.
Job 9:18 He does not allow my spirit to rest, but fills me with bitter experiences.
Job 9:19 If strength is sought, He is the mightiest. If justice is sought, no one dares to speak on my behalf.
Job 9:20 If I wanted to justify myself, my own mouth would condemn me. If I showed myself innocent, it would prove me perverse.
Job 9:21 Even if I were perfectly blameless, my soul would not recognize this, and I would be overwhelmed with sorrow.
Job 9:22 There is one truth that I have spoken: God consumes both the innocent and the wicked.
Job 9:23 If a sudden scourge brings death, He mocks the suffering of the innocent.
Job 9:24 The earth is given into the hands of the wicked. God conceals the faces of its judges. If it is not God who does this, then who is it?
Job 9:25 My days have been swifter than a swift messenger; they have fled away without seeing any good.
Job 9:26 They have passed away like swiftly loaded ships with goods, and like an eagle flying towards its prey.
Job 9:27 If I say: 'I will forget my complaint, I will ignore my roaring, and I will put on a cheerful expression,'
Job 9:28 I still fear all my sorrows, knowing that You will not spare the guilty.
Job 9:29 But if I am, even so, deemed wicked, why then have I labored in vain?
Job 9:30 If I were to wash myself with snow water, and cleanse my hands until they were as pure as possible,
Job 9:31 even then, You would plunge me into filth, and my own clothes would detest me.
Job 9:32 For I do not contend with God in a trial, as I would with a mere man who is like me; for He is not a man like me, that I could equally argue with Him.
Job 9:33 There is no arbiter who can reprove both of us, and lay his hand between us to mediate.
Job 9:34 Let Him remove His rod of chastisement from me, and let His terror not frighten me.
Job 9:35 Then I would speak and not be afraid of Him, for in my current state, I cannot be free from fear.
Job 10:1 My very being finds my life unbearable. I will unleash my complaint, even if it sounds like it’s against myself. I will speak from the deepest bitterness within my spirit.
Job 10:2 I will say to God: 'Please, do not condemn me. Show me the reason why You judge me in this way.'
Job 10:3 Does it seem right to You that You should oppress me, Your own creation, and then seem to favor the schemes of the wicked?
Job 10:4 Do You have the limited vision of mortal eyes? Do You see things the way a mere human sees them?
Job 10:5 Are Your days as fleeting as the days of a man? Are Your years as limited as human life spans?
Job 10:6 Why do You meticulously search for my guilt and scrutinize my every sin, as if You didn't already know everything?
Job 10:7 Even though You know I haven't committed any grave sin against You, there is no one who can rescue me from Your mighty hand.
Job 10:8 Your hands created me and fashioned every part of me. How can You so suddenly decide to destroy me?
Job 10:9 Please remember that You molded me from clay, and it is to dust that You will return me.
Job 10:10 Did You not pour me out like milk and then solidify me like cheese, forming my body?
Job 10:11 You clothed me with skin and flesh, and You knit me together with bones and sinews.
Job 10:12 You granted me life and Your lovingkindness, and Your watchful care preserved my very breath.
Job 10:13 Even if You have hidden purposes in Your heart regarding these matters, I still know that You remember all things—including my actions.
Job 10:14 If I have sinned, You know it instantly, and You do not allow me to be declared innocent of my wrongdoing.
Job 10:15 If I were truly wicked, then woe to me! But even if I am innocent, I cannot hold my head high, for I am utterly saturated with suffering and misery.
Job 10:16 If I show any pride, You hunt me down like a fierce lion, and again and again, You return to inflict extraordinary pain upon me.
Job 10:17 You bring fresh evidence against me, and You intensify Your anger towards me, crushing me with wave after wave of pain.
Job 10:18 Why did You bring me forth from my mother’s womb? If only I had died at birth, so that no one would have ever seen me.
Job 10:19 Then I would have been as if I had never existed, carried directly from the womb to the grave.
Job 10:20 Since my few remaining days will soon be over, please leave me alone for a little while, so I can lament my pain.
Job 10:21 Grant me this before I journey to the place of no return—the dark land, shrouded in the deepest gloom of death.
Job 10:22 It is a land of utter misery and darkness, where the shadow of death is present everywhere, and there is no order, but only an everlasting terror.
Job 11:1 Then Zophar, who was from Naamah and was one of Job's friends, replied to him, saying:
Job 11:2 Will a man who multiplies words not be heard? Or will a talkative man be justified simply by speaking much?
Job 11:3 Should men be silent before you and laugh with scorn? And when another mocks you, should no one correct him or put him to shame?
Job 11:4 For you have said, 'My doctrine and my speech are pure, and I am clean in your sight.'
Job 11:5 Oh, if only God would speak to you Himself and open His divine lips to address you directly,
Job 11:6 so that He might show you the hidden secrets of His divine wisdom and make known to you how manifold His divine law is. Then you would understand that God demands less punishment from you than your sins actually deserve.
Job 11:7 Can you possibly comprehend the deep and hidden ways of God? Or can you perfectly understand the Almighty and His infinite wisdom?
Job 11:8 God is higher than the created universe itself—what can you possibly do to reach Him? He is deeper than the underworld, the realm of the dead—how can you truly know Him?
Job 11:9 His wisdom and reach are longer than the entire earth in its measure, and wider than the vast sea.
Job 11:10 If He should overthrow things, or confine them, or restrict them—who then could possibly contradict Him or stand against His will?
Job 11:11 For He Himself knows the vanity and emptiness of human beings, and when He sees their iniquity, He does not fail to notice it.
Job 11:12 An empty and vain person proudly exalts himself, and like an untamed wild donkey, he thinks he was born free from all accountability.
Job 11:13 But you, Job, should set your heart aright and truly stretch out your hands in supplication toward Him.
Job 11:14 If you remove the iniquity that is actively in your hands—meaning your sinful deeds—and if injustice no longer dwells in your tent, your home and your life:
Job 11:15 then you will lift up your head, free from the blemish of sin, and you will be firm and steady, and you will no longer fear.
Job 11:16 You will also entirely forget your past miseries, and you will remember them only as rushing waters that have flowed away and are gone.
Job 11:17 And your light will shine forth like the brilliance of noonday, and even when you think you are failing or have come to an end, you will rise again like the morning star.
Job 11:18 And you will have confidence because hope has been set before you, and you will rest securely, deeply rooted and safe.
Job 11:19 And you will rest peacefully, and there will be no one to frighten you. Many will come to entreat your favor and seek your guidance.
Job 11:20 But the eyes of the wicked will fail and lose their sight, and all possibility of escape will perish from them. Their hope will be like the fleeting breath of life, utterly insubstantial and gone in an instant.
Job 12:1 But Job replied to them and said:
Job 12:2 Do you really think that you are the only human beings who possess wisdom? Do you think wisdom will die when you die?
Job 12:3 However, I also have understanding, just like you all do. I am not inferior to you. For who among us is ignorant of these things that you know?
Job 12:4 A man like me, who is ridiculed by his friend, will call upon God, and God will hear him. For even the straightforward righteousness of a just man is ridiculed by others.
Job 12:5 A lamp, despised in the thoughts of the wealthy, is ready to be scorned by the feet of those who stumble — meaning a man in misfortune is easily kicked aside.
Job 12:6 The tents of robbers are full of prosperity, and they boldly challenge God Himself, even though God is the one who has given everything into their hands.
Job 12:7 Indeed, if you ask the beasts of burden, they will teach you. And the birds of the sky will show you the truth.
Job 12:8 Speak to the earth, and it will teach you. And the fish of the sea will tell you.
Job 12:9 Who among all these living things does not know that the hand of the Lord has made these things?
Job 12:10 In the Lord's hand is the soul of every living creature, and the breath of all human flesh.
Job 12:11 Does not the ear discern words? And do not the mouth and palate taste and approve food for themselves?
Job 12:12 Wisdom is found among the aged, and prudence comes from long experience with many things.
Job 12:13 With God alone is true wisdom and strength. He alone has counsel and understanding.
Job 12:14 If He destroys, no one can rebuild. If He shuts a man in, no one can open his prison.
Job 12:15 If He holds back the waters, everything will dry up. And if He releases them, they will overturn the earth.
Job 12:16 With Him is strength and wisdom. He knows both the deceiver and the one who is deceived.
Job 12:17 He leads counselors to a foolish end, and He brings judges into a state of bewilderment.
Job 12:18 He loosens the belt of kings — stripping them of their authority — and binds their loins with a rope — making them prisoners.
Job 12:19 He leads priests away as captives, and He overthrows the powerful nobles.
Job 12:20 He changes the speech of those who speak truthfully, making them unable to speak, and He takes away the wisdom of the elders.
Job 12:21 He pours contempt upon princes, and He raises up those who had been oppressed.
Job 12:22 He reveals deep things from the darkness, and He brings the shadow of death into the light.
Job 12:23 He makes nations grow in number, and then He destroys them. And those that were overthrown, He restores again.
Job 12:24 He changes the heart of the leaders of the people of the earth, and He deceives them, so that they wander in vain through an untraveled wilderness.
Job 12:25 They will grope about as if in darkness, and not in the light. And He makes them stumble and wander as if they were drunk.
Job 13:2 I know these things just as well as you do. I am not inferior to any of you.
Job 13:3 But I will speak directly to the Almighty One. I intend to bring a charge against Him.
Job 13:4 But you are merely forgers of lies. You are ministers of perverse doctrines.
Job 13:5 I wish you would just keep silent, so that you might be considered wise!
Job 13:6 Therefore, hear my rebuke. Pay attention to the judgment coming from my lips.
Job 13:7 Does God truly need your lies, so that you may speak deceitfully on His behalf?
Job 13:8 Or is it more pleasing to Him that you speak falsely for Him?
Job 13:9 Or will He bring you forward to examine you? Can God be mocked, just as a human can be mocked?
Job 13:10 He Himself will rebuke you, because you render judgment in secret.
Job 13:11 As soon as He reveals Himself to you, His terror will shake you.
Job 13:12 Your memory will be compared to ashes, and your defense will be like a heap of mud.
Job 13:13 Be silent for a little while, so that I may speak whatever my mind suggests to me.
Job 13:14 Why do I tear my flesh with my teeth? Why do I carry my life in my hands, risking it all?
Job 13:15 Even if He kills me, I will still hope in Him. Nevertheless, I will argue my case and my ways in His presence.
Job 13:16 And He Himself will be my Savior, my deliverer. For indeed, no hypocrite will come into His presence.
Job 13:17 Listen carefully to my discourse, and let your ears perceive my true meaning.
Job 13:18 Look! My judgment, my defense, is prepared. I know that I will be found just.
Job 13:19 Who is it that will contend with me in judgment? Let them come forward. What reason do I have to remain silent?
Job 13:20 Only two things, please do not do to me, and then I will not hide from your presence.
Job 13:21 Keep Your hand far from me, and let Your terrifying majesty not frighten me.
Job 13:22 Propose what You wish, and I will answer. Or indeed, let me speak, and You respond to me.
Job 13:23 How many iniquities and sins do I have? Show me my crimes and my offenses.
Job 13:24 Why do You hide Your face? Why do You consider me to be Your enemy?
Job 13:25 Against a leaf that is snatched away by the wind, do You display Your power? Do You pursue a dry stubble of straw?
Job 13:26 For You write bitter accusations against me, and You consume me with the sins of my youth.
Job 13:27 You have put my foot in stocks. You have watched all my paths, and You have considered the very tracks of my feet.
Job 13:28 I, who am to be consumed as if by rot, and like a garment that is eaten by a moth.
Job 14:1 Every man born from a woman lives for only a brief time. His life is filled with many troubles and sufferings.
Job 14:2 He comes forth like a flower, blooming only to be crushed and wither away. His life flees like a quickly passing shadow, and he never remains in the same state—constantly changing, constantly moving towards death.
Job 14:3 Do You, O God, consider it worthy to even look upon such a fleeting creature? Do You bring such a one into Your judgment with You?
Job 14:4 Who can make a clean thing out of something conceived from unclean seed, from a fallen human lineage? Only You, O God, can do that.
Job 14:5 The days of man are short. The number of his months are determined by You, O God. You have set his boundaries, and these cannot be surpassed or extended.
Job 14:6 Turn away from him for a little while, so that he may find some rest, until his appointed day of death comes—a day he looks forward to, just as a hired laborer longs for the end of his day to receive his wages.
Job 14:7 Even a tree has hope: if it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new branches will bud and grow.
Job 14:8 Even if its root grows old in the earth, and its stump appears to die away into the dust,
Job 14:9 Yet, at the mere scent of water, it will bud and spring to life again, producing new foliage as if it were a young sapling freshly planted.
Job 14:10 But when a man dies, when his body is stripped of life and consumed, where, I ask, is he? There is no hope of his return to earthly life.
Job 14:11 Just as the waters of the sea may recede, and a river, once full, becomes empty and dries up completely,
Job 14:12 So it is with man: once he dies, he will not rise again from that sleep, not until the very universe itself is worn away. He will not awaken, nor will he rise from his slumber in this earthly existence.
Job 14:13 Oh, that someone would grant me this: that You would hide me in Sheol, or keep me in some secret place until Your divine wrath has passed over. And that You would then appoint a time when You would remember me.
Job 14:14 If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my current struggle and service, I wait and hope until my change comes—the end of this suffering.
Job 14:15 Then You will call to me, and I will answer You. You will extend Your right hand to the work of Your own hands, to me, Your creation.
Job 14:16 Indeed, You closely observe my every step. But in that time, You will be merciful to my sins.
Job 14:17 You have sealed up my iniquities as if in a bag for safekeeping, yet You have also covered over and healed my offenses.
Job 14:18 But as a mountain crumbling eventually vanishes, and a rock is dislodged and moved from its place,
Job 14:19 Just as water wears down stones, and an overwhelming flood gradually consumes the land, in the same way, You destroy the hope of man.
Job 14:20 You overcome him, and he passes away. You change his countenance in death, and You send him away from life.
Job 14:21 Whether his sons become honored or remain unknown, he does not know it. He is unaware of the fate of his descendants.
Job 14:22 However, his own flesh, while he lives, will feel pain, and his soul within him will mourn over its own suffering.
Job 15:1 Eliphaz the Themanite then responded and said:
Job 15:2 Can any wise man truly respond with words that are as empty as wind, and then fill his stomach with such emptiness?
Job 15:3 Do you argue against him with empty words? You are not his equal, and you gain nothing with such speech.
Job 15:4 Indeed, you have dissolved all reverence for God, and you have diminished the importance of prayer before God.
Job 15:5 For your iniquity has filled your mouth, and your tongue plans out blasphemies.
Job 15:6 Your own tongue condemns you, not I; your own lips speak against you.
Job 15:7 Were you the first man ever born, and formed before the hills?
Job 15:8 Have you heard the counsel of God, and do you keep all wisdom to yourself?
Job 15:9 What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that we are unaware of?
Job 15:10 Both old men and those with ancient wisdom are among us, many much older than your father.
Job 15:11 Is it such a great thing that God would console you? And does your ear gently hear the secret words from you?
Job 15:12 Why is your heart so lifted up with pride, and why do you have such astonished eyes, as if you are provoking God to anger?
Job 15:13 Why does your spirit swell against God, so that you utter such words from your mouth?
Job 15:14 What is man, that he should be without sin, or that one born of a woman should be justified?
Job 15:15 Behold, even the holy ones are not steadfast in His sight, and even the heavens are not pure in His presence.
Job 15:16 How much more abominable and useless is man, who drinks iniquity as if it were water?
Job 15:17 I will show you, listen to me: and what I have found through experience, I will tell you.
Job 15:18 What wise men declare, and what their fathers have not hidden from them:
Job 15:19 To whom alone the land was given, and no foreigner passed among them.
Job 15:20 The wicked man is arrogant all his days, and the number of years of his tyranny is uncertain.
Job 15:21 The sound of terror is always in his ears, and even when there is peace, his snares are always timid.
Job 15:22 He does not believe that he will return from the darkness, and he always expects another sword from every side.
Job 15:23 When he flees for bread, where is it prepared for him? He knows that darkness is ready for him in the day.
Job 15:24 Trouble and anguish will terrify him, and will prevail against him, like a king preparing for battle.
Job 15:25 For he has stretched out his hand against God, and has strengthened himself against the Almighty.
Job 15:26 He ran against Him with a stiff neck, under the boss of his own neck's shield.
Job 15:27 For you have indeed consumed his abundance, and his very substance.
Job 15:28 You have covered your own face with your own fat, and you make your neck heavy with your own indulgence.
Job 15:29 He will not become rich, nor will his substance endure, nor will he send forth his root into the earth.
Job 15:30 He will not escape the darkness; the flame will wither his branches; and his spirit will be taken away by the breath of God.
Job 15:31 Let him not trust in vain, having been led astray by error, believing that he might be redeemed by any price.
Job 15:32 He will perish before his appointed days, and his branches will not flourish.
Job 15:33 He will pluck off his unripe grape like a vine, and cast off his blossom like an olive tree.
Job 15:34 For the assembly of the hypocrite is barren, and fire will devour the tents of those who take bribes.
Job 15:35 He conceives sorrow, and gives birth to iniquity, and his womb prepares deceits.

Job 16:1 Job, however, responded and said:
Job 16:2 I have often heard such words as these. All of you are burdensome comforters.
Job 16:3 Will these empty words never end? Or what has provoked you to speak like this?
Job 16:4 I also could speak similar words, and if only your souls were in place of my soul!
Job 16:5 I could also strengthen you with my words and shake my head at you in mock sympathy.
Job 16:6 If I speak, my pain does not cease. And if I am silent, it does not leave me.
Job 16:7 But now, my affliction has saddened me, and it has devastated my entire household.
Job 16:8 My wrinkles are a witness, even a false witness, that accuses me. My adversary, standing up against me with lies, makes my face gaunt.
Job 16:9 In His wrath, He has torn me apart and opposed me. He has gnashed His teeth at me. My enemy has looked upon me with terrible eyes.
Job 16:10 They have opened their mouths wide against me. They have struck my cheek with reproaches. They have gathered together against me.
Job 16:11 God has shut me up among the wicked and has handed me over into the hands of the impious.
Job 16:12 I, who was once prosperous, have suddenly been crushed. He has seized my hair and torn me apart. He has set me up as a target for arrows.
Job 16:13 His spears have surrounded me. They pierce my kidneys without mercy. He has spilled my entrails upon the earth.
Job 16:14 He cuts me with wound upon wound. He rushes upon me like a mighty warrior.
Job 16:15 I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, and I have covered my flesh with ashes.
Job 16:16 My face has become swollen from weeping, and my eyelids have grown dark.
Job 16:17 Though there is no iniquity in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
Job 16:18 O Earth, do not cover my blood, and let my cry find no hiding place within you!
Job 16:19 For behold, my Witness is in the universe, and my Advocate is in the highest realms.
Job 16:20 My interpreter, my friend, is for me. My eye weeps tears to God.
Job 16:21 Oh, that there might be a judgment between a man and God, just as there is between a man and his neighbor!
Job 16:22 For a few years are passing quickly, and I walk a path from which I will not return.
Job 17:1 My spirit is broken, my days are few, and the grave is all that is left for me.
Job 17:2 All around me, I hear nothing but their taunts. My eyes are consumed with bitterness and grief.
Job 17:3 Grant me a hearing directly before You! Let Your hand be a witness against me. For who else is there who can stand as my guarantor and defend my cause?
Job 17:4 You have removed wisdom from their hearts, from my friends. That is why they will never be raised up in honor.
Job 17:5 He who betrays his companions for profit, making empty promises of gain, will find that his own children’s eyes fail and become blind.
Job 17:6 But He has made me a byword to the peoples, an example for those who have been utterly silenced by suffering.
Job 17:7 My eyes have grown dim from all my grief, and my limbs have wasted away to nothing.
Job 17:8 The righteous will be astonished by what has happened to me, and the innocent will rise up against the hypocrite.
Job 17:9 Yet the righteous will hold firm to his path, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.
Job 17:10 So then, turn back, all of you, and come to me! Yet I still will not find a single wise person among you.
Job 17:11 My days are over. My plans are shattered, and with them, the very torments of my heart have been laid bare.
Job 17:12 They claim to turn night into day, yet I still foolishly hope for light after such darkness.
Job 17:13 If I must only wait, then the grave is my home, and in its darkness I have already made my bed.
Job 17:14 I have said to corruption: “You are my father!” To worms, I have said: “You are my mother and my sister!”
Job 17:15 Where then is my hope now? And where is my patience? Truly, You are my Lord, my God!
Job 17:16 All that I have will descend with me into the deepest earth, and together, we will rest in the dust.
Job 18:1 Bildad from Shuah then responded and spoke:
Job 18:2 “How long will you never stop talking? First, understand what we are saying, and then let us speak clearly.”
Job 18:3 “Why are we regarded as mere animals, and considered vile in your presence?”
Job 18:4 “You are destroying yourself in your fury. But will the created universe then be abandoned because of you, and rocks be moved from their appointed places?”
Job 18:5 “Truly, the light of the ungodly person will be extinguished, and the bright flame of his life will not shine.”
Job 18:6 “The light of his dwelling will turn to darkness, and his lamp, which is over his head, will be utterly extinguished.”
Job 18:7 “His powerful and decisive steps will be hindered, and his own plans will lead to his downfall.”
Job 18:8 “Snares are set for his feet, and he walks right into the traps laid out like nets.”
Job 18:9 “A trap will grasp his foot, and a snare will close tightly upon him.”
Job 18:10 “His trap is hidden in the ground, and a snare for him is set along the path he walks.”
Job 18:11 “On every side, terrors startle him, and they relentlessly pursue his steps.”
Job 18:12 “His physical strength will be weakened by starvation, and thirst will constantly torment him deep within his body.”
Job 18:13 “The 'firstborn of death' will devour the beauty of his skin, and a fatal disease will consume his limbs.”
Job 18:14 “His confidence will be driven from his home, and he will be led to ruin, like a king of terrors leading him to wickedness.”
Job 18:15 “Strangers will live in his former dwelling, and sulfur will be sprinkled over his tent as a sign of utter destruction.”
Job 18:16 “His roots will dry up from above, and his branches below will wither away.”
Job 18:17 “His memory will vanish from the earth, and his name will never be spoken in the public squares.”
Job 18:18 “He will be driven out from the light of the living into complete darkness, and he will be swept away from the face of the entire world.”
Job 18:19 “He will have no children or descendants among his people, and no one remaining in his own lands.”
Job 18:20 “Those who come after him will be astonished at his fate, and those living now will be seized with horror at what happens to him.”
Job 18:21 “These, therefore, are the dwellings of an ungodly person, and this is the ultimate fate of anyone who refuses to acknowledge God.”
Job 19:1 But Job responded by saying:
Job 19:2 “How long will you torment my very soul and crush me with your words?
Job 19:3 Indeed, you have now shamed me many, many times—you repeatedly put me to confusion. And you show no shame in oppressing me.
Job 19:4 Even if I have indeed erred, my error remains with me alone.
Job 19:5 Yet you exalt yourselves against me, and you use my very disgrace as an argument against me.
Job 19:6 Know therefore that it is God who has twisted me into this state, and He has encompassed me with His very power.
Job 19:7 Behold, I will cry out, enduring great violence, and no one will listen to me. I will raise my voice in protest, but there is no one to grant me justice.
Job 19:8 He has walled up my path so I cannot pass through it. He has plunged my journey into darkness.
Job 19:9 He has stripped me of my glory and has taken the crown from my head.
Job 19:10 He has destroyed me from every direction, and I am perishing. Like an uprooted tree, He has torn away my hope.
Job 19:11 Indeed, His fury has been kindled against me, and He has considered me as His very enemy.
Job 19:12 His armies have advanced together, and they have forced their way through me. They have besieged my dwelling on every side.
Job 19:13 He has driven my brothers far from me, and my acquaintances have departed as if they were strangers.
Job 19:14 My closest relatives have forsaken me, and those who knew me have completely forgotten me.
Job 19:15 Even the tenants of my house and my own maidservants have treated me as a stranger, and I have become like a foreigner in their eyes.
Job 19:16 I called my own servant, but he did not answer me. With my very own mouth I had to beg him.
Job 19:17 My wife has abhorred my very breath, and the foul odor from my mouth is repulsive even to the children of my own body.
Job 19:18 Even little children have made me an outcast, and when they rise up, they speak against me.
Job 19:19 My former counselors have abhorred me, and those whom I loved most have turned themselves against me.
Job 19:20 My bone clings to my skin, my flesh having been consumed away. Only my lips remain around my teeth.
Job 19:21 Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you, my friends, for the hand of the Lord has struck me down.
Job 19:22 Why do you persecute me as God does, and why are you not satisfied with devouring my very flesh?
Job 19:23 Oh, that someone would grant me this: that my words might be written down, that they might be inscribed into a book!
Job 19:24 That with an iron stylus and a leaden tablet, or with a chisel, they might be carved into rock, forever!
Job 19:25 For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that at the very end of time I will rise again from the earth.
Job 19:26 And I will again be clothed with my skin, and in my very own flesh I will see my God.
Job 19:27 It is He whom I myself shall see, and my own eyes shall behold Him, and not another's. This is the very hope that is laid up in my heart.
Job 19:28 Why then do you now say, 'How shall we persecute him and find the root of the matter to condemn him?'
Job 19:29 Therefore, flee from the presence of the sword, for the sword is the avenger of iniquities. And know that there will be a judgment.
Job 20:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite responded and said:
Job 20:2 Therefore, my thoughts are agitated and conflicting, and my mind is swept in many directions.
Job 20:3 I hear the argument with which you accuse me, and my inner discernment will speak on my behalf.
Job 20:4 Do you not know this truth, which has been from the very beginning, ever since mankind was placed upon the earth?
Job 20:5 That the exultation of the wicked is short-lived, and the joy of the hypocrite lasts only for a moment?
Job 20:6 Even if his arrogance reaches up to the very sky, and his head touches the clouds,
Job 20:7 He will be utterly destroyed like refuse at the end of his life, and those who saw him will say: 'Where has he gone?'
Job 20:8 He will vanish without a trace, like a dream that flies away, and he will flee like a vision seen in the night.
Job 20:9 The eye that once saw him will see him no more, and the place where he lived will not behold him again.
Job 20:10 His children will be reduced to poverty because of his suffering, and his own hands will return his sorrows to him.
Job 20:11 His bones are filled with the iniquities of his youth, and these will lie down with him in the dust of the grave.
Job 20:12 Even if evil tastes sweet in his mouth, so that he hides it under his tongue,
Job 20:13 Even if he cherishes it and will not let it go, hiding it deep within his throat,
Job 20:14 That same bread of evil will turn to viper's venom inside his stomach.
Job 20:15 The riches that he swallowed down, he will vomit up again, for God will extract them from his belly.
Job 20:16 He will suck the venom of serpents, and the viper's tongue will kill him.
Job 20:17 He will not see the abundant flow of streams, nor the rivers flowing with milk and honey.
Job 20:18 He will restore what he gained by his labor, but he will not enjoy it; in proportion to the multitude of his evil deeds, so he suffers, yet he cannot consume them.
Job 20:19 Because he crushed and stripped the poor, and violently seized a house but did not build it fairly.
Job 20:20 His appetite for gain was never satisfied, and even when he had what he desired, he could not truly possess it.
Job 20:21 Nothing remained of his greedy consumption, and because of this, his ill-gotten gains will not endure.
Job 20:22 When he thinks he has enough and is abundant, he will be constrained; then every kind of sorrow will rush upon him.
Job 20:23 God will fill his stomach with retribution; He will send His fierce anger into him and rain His war upon him.
Job 20:24 He will flee from weapons of iron, only to be struck by arrows of bronze.
Job 20:25 An arrow is drawn, it comes out from its quiver, flashing in its bitterness it pierces him: and the horror of death falls upon him.
Job 20:26 Every hidden treasure of his will be lost in darkness; a fire not kindled by human hands will consume him; he will be oppressed and afflicted in his own dwelling.
Job 20:27 The very sky will reveal his iniquity, and the earth itself will rise up against him.
Job 20:28 The harvest of his house will be laid bare and stripped away on the day of God's wrath.
Job 20:29 This is the portion for the wicked man from God, and this is the inheritance ordained by the Lord for his words and deeds.
Job 20:30 
Job 20:31 
Job 20:32 
Job 20:33 
Job 20:34 
Job 20:35 
Job 20:36 
Job 20:37 
Job 20:38 
Job 20:39 
Job 20:40 
Job 21:1 But Job answered, and then he spoke:
Job 21:2 Please, listen to my words, and reconsider what you believe.
Job 21:3 Bear with me until I have finished speaking; then, after my words, you can laugh at me.
Job 21:4 Are my complaints just about men? No, they are about God. So why wouldn't I grieve over this?
Job 21:5 Listen to me, and be shocked by what I say, then put your finger over your mouth to remain silent.
Job 21:6 Indeed, when I remember these things, I am filled with horror, and a tremor shakes my entire body.
Job 21:7 Why then do the wicked live? They prosper and become powerful with wealth.
Job 21:8 Their children survive to adulthood right before their eyes, and their descendants live with them.
Job 21:9 Their homes are safe from any fear, and the rod of God's judgment is not upon them.
Job 21:10 Their bull mates, and the cow doesn't miscarry; their cow gives birth, and it is never barren.
Job 21:11 They send out their little children like a flock of sheep, and their children skip and dance with joy.
Job 21:12 They celebrate with tambourines and harps, and they rejoice at the sound of the pipe organ.
Job 21:13 They spend their days in prosperity and happiness, and in an instant, they descend into the grave.
Job 21:14 These are the ones who said to God: 'Get away from us! We do not want to know your ways!'
Job 21:15 Who is the Almighty God, that we should serve Him? What benefit would we gain if we prayed to Him?
Job 21:16 Look, their good fortune does not come from their own hands, and may the counsel of the wicked be far from me.
Job 21:17 How often does the lamp of the wicked truly go out, and calamity come upon them? How often does God distribute sorrows in His anger to them?
Job 21:18 Are they truly like chaff before the wind, and like dust that a whirlwind carries away?
Job 21:19 You say God saves the punishment of a man for his children. Let Him punish the man himself, so that the man knows he is being judged.
Job 21:20 Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink deeply of the Almighty's fury.
Job 21:21 For what does the wicked man care about his household after he's gone, even if the number of his months is cut in half?
Job 21:22 Can anyone teach God anything, when He judges even those who are exalted?
Job 21:23 One man dies strong and healthy, rich and content.
Job 21:24 His body is well-fed and full of vigor, and his bones are full of strong marrow.
Job 21:25 And another man dies with a bitter soul, having never known prosperity.
Job 21:26 And both of them will lie down together in the dust, and worms will cover them.
Job 21:27 I certainly know your thoughts, and the judgments by which you try to crush me.
Job 21:28 For you will say: 'Where is the house of the great man? And where are the tents of the wicked?'
Job 21:29 Ask anyone who travels widely, and learn from them what they have observed.
Job 21:30 They will tell you that the evil person is kept safe until the day of their destruction, and is led to the day of wrath.
Job 21:31 Who will directly confront a wicked man about his lifestyle? And who will repay him for what he has done?
Job 21:32 Even he himself is carried to his grave, and will remain among the gathered dead.
Job 21:33 The dust of the grave will be sweet to him when he dies without suffering. And after him, all men are drawn to death, just as countless others have gone before him.
Job 21:34 How then can you comfort me in such a useless way, when your answer clearly contradicts the evidence?
Job 22:1 And Eliphaz the Temanite then answered, saying:
Job 22:2 “Can any human being really benefit God, even when a wise man is useful only to himself?
Job 22:3 What benefit is it to the Most High if you are righteous, or what advantage does He gain if your ways are pure?
Job 22:4 Is it because of your reverence that He judges you, bringing you into judgment?
Job 22:5 Is it not rather that your wickedness is immense, and your iniquities are boundless?
Job 22:6 For you took your brothers’ garments as security for loans, and you left the truly naked without their coverings.
Job 22:7 You gave no water to the weary, and you withheld bread from the hungry.
Job 22:8 By the mere strength of your arm, you took possession of the land, and as the most powerful, you seized it for yourself.
Job 22:9 You sent widows away with nothing, and you crushed the hopes and strength of orphans.
Job 22:10 Because of this, traps surround you, and sudden terror utterly confuses you.
Job 22:11 Or if you want to know what’s coming, it’s darkness, and you will see nothing; a deluge of waters will completely overwhelm you.
Job 22:12 Is God not truly in the highest heavens? Just look at the furthest stars; can you not see how immensely high they are?
Job 22:13 Yet you then say, “What could God possibly know? Can He truly judge through the darkness?”
Job 22:14 You think the clouds hide Him, that He does not consider our affairs, and that He merely walks around the edges of the universe.
Job 22:15 Are you following the ancient path that wicked men have walked?
Job 22:16 Those men were swept away before their time, and a sudden flood washed away their very foundation.
Job 22:17 They were the ones who said to God, “Leave us alone!” and treated the Most High as though He were utterly insignificant.
Job 22:18 Even though He had filled their homes with good things, they rejected Him. May such a thought be far from you.
Job 22:19 The righteous will see this and rejoice, and the innocent will scorn these wicked men, saying:
Job 22:20 “Has not the one who stood against God been utterly cut down, and has not fire consumed what remained of them?”
Job 22:21 Therefore, submit yourself to Him and live in peace; through this, you will attain the most excellent rewards.
Job 22:22 Receive His divine law from His own mouth, and engrave His very words upon your heart.
Job 22:23 If you truly return to the Almighty, you will be restored; and you will remove all wickedness far from your dwelling.
Job 22:24 He will give you gold instead of dust, and for the ordinary stones of the riverbed, He will give you the finest gold of Ophir.
Job 22:25 And the Almighty Himself will stand against your enemies, and silver will be accumulated in abundance for you.
Job 22:26 Then you will find your greatest delight in the Almighty, and you will confidently lift your face to God.
Job 22:27 You will call upon Him in prayer, and He will hear you; then you will fulfill the vows you made.
Job 22:28 You will make a decree, and it will be established for you; and a radiant light will shine upon your path.
Job 22:29 If you have been humbled, you will say, “I was proud,” and the one who casts down his eyes in humility will be saved.
Job 22:30 The innocent person will be saved, and he will be delivered through the purity of his hands.
Job 23:1 Job then spoke and said:
Job 23:2 Even now, my bitterness rises up against me, and my suffering is made heavier by my own groans.
Job 23:3 If only someone would grant me to know Him, to find Him, so I could come all the way to His very throne.
Job 23:4 I would lay out my case before Him, and fill my mouth with arguments against what has happened.
Job 23:5 I would know what words He would use to answer me, and I would understand what He would say to me.
Job 23:6 Would He argue against me with many words? No, He Himself, contending with me, would listen.
Job 23:7 There, a just Judge would speak with me, and I would be set free from my own judgment of myself.
Job 23:8 If I go to the east, He is not there; if to the west, I would not perceive Him.
Job 23:9 If to the north (the left hand), how can He be there? I will not grasp Him. If to the south (the right hand), I will not catch sight of Him.
Job 23:10 But He Himself knows my way. He has tested me like gold, which is purified through fire.
Job 23:11 My foot has followed His footsteps. I have kept His way and have not turned aside from it.
Job 23:12 From the commands of His lips, I have not turned away. I have hidden the words of His mouth in my heart.
Job 23:13 For He alone is God, and no one can turn aside His thoughts. Whatever His soul desires, that He does.
Job 23:14 And when He completes what He wills for me, then He will finish it. Many such things are with Him.
Job 23:15 And because of this, I am troubled before His presence. When I consider it, I am filled with dread.
Job 23:16 God has softened my heart, but the Almighty has also troubled me.
Job 23:17 For the darkness has not vanished from before my face, and deep gloom has covered my face.
Job 24:1 Why doesn't God keep His appointed times hidden? And why do those who know Him not understand His specific days of judgment?
Job 24:2 There are wicked men who move boundary markers to steal land. They violently seize flocks of animals and then feed themselves from them.
Job 24:3 They drive away the donkeys and oxen that belong to orphans, and they take the camel of a widow as collateral, seizing it for themselves.
Job 24:4 They push the poor off the path. All the meek and humble people of the land are forced to hide from them together.
Job 24:5 Look! Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go out to their work, diligently watching for any food they can find. The desolate land itself provides them with their sustenance in their loneliness.
Job 24:6 These wicked men harvest a field that is not theirs. A slanderer will also strip the vineyard of a poor person.
Job 24:7 The poor spend the night naked and without clothing, and they have no covering against the biting cold.
Job 24:8 They are drenched by the mountain rains, and having no shelter, they cling to the bare rock for warmth and protection.
Job 24:9 The wicked steal an orphan from its mother's breast, and they take the cloak of the poor as a pledge, leaving them exposed and destitute.
Job 24:10 So the poor walk around naked and lacking clothing, and, being hungry, they carry sheaves of grain, having gleaned what little they can.
Job 24:11 They labor at noon among the piles of grain, and though they have trodden the wine presses, they still suffer thirst.
Job 24:12 From out of individual cities, groans rise up. The souls of the wounded cry out for justice, yet God does not appear to permit anyone to come to their aid.
Job 24:13 These wicked men are enemies of the light. They do not know its ways, nor do they stay in its paths.
Job 24:14 The murderer rises early in the morning. He kills the needy and the poor, and by night, he becomes like a common thief.
Job 24:15 The eye of the adulterer watches for the deep darkness, saying to himself, 'No eye will see me.' And he covers his face.
Job 24:16 In the darkness, these criminals break into houses as they planned to do in daylight. They will never know the light.
Job 24:17 If the dawn should suddenly appear, they consider it the very shadow of death. So it is that they spend their time dwelling in darkness as if it were their light.
Job 24:18 This wicked man is swift to act on the surface of the earth. May his portion on earth be cursed, and may he no longer work his evil deeds in the path leading to the vineyards.
Job 24:19 Just as drought and heat consume snow water, so too will those who have sinned be swept away to the underworld.
Job 24:20 May mercy completely forget such a man. May the worms not even remember his body's sweetness. Instead, let his wickedness be broken apart like decaying wood.
Job 24:21 This wicked man preys on the barren woman who cannot bear children, and he does not do any good for the widow.
Job 24:22 By his own strength, this man pulls down even the mighty. When he stands, he has no lasting belief in his own life, for his end is coming.
Job 24:23 God seems to lead him to a false sense of security, and he will be sustained there for a time. Yet, God's eyes constantly watch all of their wicked ways.
Job 24:24 The wicked are exalted for a short time, but they will not truly endure. They will be brought low like all other mortals, taken away, and they will collapse like the tops of withered grain stalks.
Job 24:25 If all of this is not true, then who can refute me and clearly demonstrate that my words are a lie?
Job 25:1 Bildad the Shuhite replied to Job by saying this:
Job 25:2 What power and terror God possesses! He is the One who establishes perfect order throughout all the highest heavens.
Job 25:3 Can anyone number God’s armies in the heavens? And is there anyone whom His light does not reach?
Job 25:4 How can any human claim to be righteous when compared to God? Or how can anyone born from a woman truly be pure and clean?
Job 25:5 Behold, even the moon itself does not shine brightly enough in His presence, and even the stars are not pure in His sight.
Job 25:6 How much more, then, is a human being mere decay, and the son of man nothing more than a worm?
Job 26:1 But Job responded and said:
Job 26:2 “Who have you helped? Was it perhaps the weak? And did you strengthen the arm of the powerful?”
Job 26:3 “To whom did you give counsel? Was it perhaps to one lacking wisdom? And have you shown much prudence?”
Job 26:4 “Whom did you wish to teach? Is it not the one who already has spirit and understanding?”
Job 26:5 “Look, the mighty ones groan beneath the waters, along with those who dwell with them.”
Job 26:6 “The underworld is exposed before Him, and there is no covering for the place of destruction.”
Job 26:7 “He stretches out the north over the void, and He hangs the earth upon nothing in the vastness of the universe.”
Job 26:8 “He binds the waters in His clouds, so that they do not burst forth all at once downwards as a flood.”
Job 26:9 “He grasps the face of His throne, spreading His cloud over it, veiling His majesty.”
Job 26:10 “He has drawn a boundary around the waters, reaching to the very edge where light and darkness meet and end in the cosmos.”
Job 26:11 “The very pillars of the universe tremble and are terrified at His command.”
Job 26:12 “By His strength, He stirs up the seas, and by His understanding, He strikes down any proud, rebellious force.”
Job 26:13 “His Spirit adorned the skies with constellations and stars, and by His guiding hand, the twisted Serpent—representing cosmic evil—was brought forth into its appointed place.”
Job 26:14 “Look, these are but the merest fragments of His ways; we have heard only a whisper of His words. For who can truly grasp and contemplate the thunder of His immeasurable greatness?”
Job 27:1 Job then began his solemn discourse again, and said:
Job 27:2 "As surely as God lives, He is the One who has refused to judge my case fairly, and the Almighty is the One who has brought such bitterness to my soul."
Job 27:3 "For as long as there is breath in me, and as long as the life-giving Spirit of God is in my nostrils,"
Job 27:4 "My lips will not speak injustice, nor will my tongue utter any lie."
Job 27:5 "Far be it from me to ever declare you in the right! Until my very last breath, I will not give up my integrity."
Job 27:6 "I will never abandon the righteous defense I have begun to make for myself. Indeed, I do not acknowledge that I have acted unjustly."
Job 27:7 "May my enemy suffer the fate of the wicked, and may my adversary be treated like the unjust."
Job 27:8 "For what hope does the hypocrite have, if he has gained something by violence, yet God does not deliver his soul from judgment?"
Job 27:9 "Will God truly hear his cry when distress overwhelms him?"
Job 27:10 "Or will he take delight in the Almighty, or call upon God at all times?"
Job 27:11 "I will teach you about what God's hand does, and I will not hide from you what belongs to the Almighty."
Job 27:12 "Behold, you all already know this; why then do you speak in vain?"
Job 27:13 "This is the portion of the wicked person from God, and it is the inheritance of violent individuals that they will receive from the Almighty."
Job 27:14 "If his children multiply, they will be destined for the sword; and his descendants will never have enough bread to satisfy them."
Job 27:15 "Those who are left of his family will be buried by a plague, and his widows will not weep for them."
Job 27:16 "If he piles up silver as if it were mere dust from the earth, and if he prepares garments as if they were mud;"
Job 27:17 "He may prepare them indeed, but the righteous person will wear those garments, and the innocent will divide his silver."
Job 27:18 "He built his house like a moth's nest, and he made his shelter like a temporary booth."
Job 27:19 "When the rich man lies down in death, he will take nothing with him. He will open his eyes in the afterlife, and find that he has nothing."
Job 27:20 "Misfortune will seize him like a flood of water, and a whirlwind will snatch him away in the night."
Job 27:21 "A scorching wind will carry him off and sweep him away; like a whirlwind, it will snatch him from his place."
Job 27:22 "God will hurl calamity upon him without mercy; he will desperately try to flee from God's hand."
Job 27:23 "People will clap their hands at him in scorn, and hiss him away from his place."
Job 28:1 Indeed, silver has its origin within specific veins in the earth,
and gold has a designated place where it is melted and purified.
Job 28:2 Iron is extracted from the earth,
and stone, when dissolved by intense heat, is transformed into copper.
Job 28:3 Man himself sets limits to the dark earth, exploring its deep places,
and he pursues all things to their ultimate end.
He also unearths the precious stones from utter darkness and the shadow of death, enduringly searching.
Job 28:4 Man directs streams of water underground to his workings,
and he brings what was hidden deep within the earth out into the light.
Job 28:5 The very earth from which our bread comes is undermined far beneath the surface,
turned over and searched out as if by the intensity of fire.
Job 28:6 Its stones are the source of sapphires,
and its very soil yields gold.
Job 28:7 No bird of prey knows the path to these depths,
nor has the keen eye of a vulture ever seen such places.
Job 28:8 No proud, mighty animal has ever walked this path,
nor has a lioness passed through these passages.
Job 28:9 Man stretches out his hand against the flinty rock,
and he tunnels beneath mountains, overturning them from their foundations.
Job 28:10 He carves out tunnels and channels through the rocks,
and his eye spots every precious thing hidden within them.
Job 28:11 He has explored the depths of rivers,
and he brings forth hidden treasures into the light.
Job 28:12 But true wisdom, where can it be found?
And where is the dwelling place of true understanding?
Job 28:13 Mankind does not know its true value,
nor can it be found in the land of those who live in ease and comfort.
Job 28:14 The great deep says: 'It is not hidden within me,'
and the sea proclaims: 'It is not found with me.'
Job 28:15 No amount of purest refined gold can buy it,
nor can silver be weighed out as a fair exchange for it.
Job 28:16 It cannot be purchased with the finest colored gems from India,
nor can it be compared to the most precious sardonyx or sapphire.
Job 28:17 Neither gold nor precious crystal can be compared to it,
nor can vessels made of pure gold be given in exchange for it.
Job 28:18 Coral and crystal are not even mentioned in comparison to it;
true wisdom, however, is drawn not from these hidden earthly places, but from divine mysteries.
Job 28:19 The finest topaz from Ethiopia cannot equal it,
nor can it be compared to the most intensely colored dyes.
Job 28:20 So, where then does wisdom truly come from?
And what is the actual place where understanding resides?
Job 28:21 It is hidden from the sight of all living beings,
and it is concealed even from the birds of the sky.
Job 28:22 The realms of Destruction and Death themselves have declared:
'We have only heard a rumor of its existence with our own ears.'
Job 28:23 God alone fully comprehends its path,
and He Himself knows its true location.
Job 28:24 For He looks upon all things, even to the very ends of the universe,
and He observes everything that exists under the sky.
Job 28:25 It is He who gave the winds their proper force and weight,
and who measured out the waters with exact precision.
Job 28:26 It was He who established the laws for the rain,
and who set the path for the roaring storms.
Job 28:27 Then He Himself saw wisdom,
He declared its nature, He prepared its dwelling, and He completely understood it.
Job 28:28 And to mankind, He declared:
'Behold, the reverence and holy fear of the Lord—that alone is true wisdom;
and to turn away from evil—that is true understanding.'
Job 29:1 Job then continued his lament, speaking these words:
Job 29:2 Oh, if only I could return to how it was in past months, to those days when God protected me!
Job 29:3 When His lamp shone bright above my head, and I walked through the darkness by His light?
Job 29:4 As I was in the days of my youth, when God's secret presence was with me in my tent?
Job 29:5 When the Almighty was with me, and my children gathered around me?
Job 29:6 When I would wash my feet in cream, and the rock itself would pour out streams of olive oil for me?
Job 29:7 When I went out to the city gate, and set up my seat in the public square?
Job 29:8 The young men saw me and would step aside respectfully, and the elders would rise and show reverence.
Job 29:9 The leaders would stop speaking, and place a finger over their mouths in silence.
Job 29:10 They would make the voices of the noblemen fall silent, and their tongues would stick to the roof of their mouths.
Job 29:11 Every ear that heard me would bless me, and every eye that saw me bore witness in my favor:
Job 29:12 Because I rescued the poor person who cried out for help, and the orphan who had no one to assist him.
Job 29:13 The blessing of the one about to perish came upon me, and I brought comfort to the heart of the widow.
Job 29:14 I clothed myself with righteousness, and it covered me like a garment; my justice was like a royal diadem.
Job 29:15 I was eyes for the blind, and feet for the lame.
Job 29:16 I was a father to the poor, and I diligently investigated any case I did not understand fully.
Job 29:17 I crushed the jaws of the wicked, and snatched the prey from between his teeth.
Job 29:18 And I said to myself: “I will die in my own nest, and I will multiply my days like the palm tree.”
Job 29:19 My root was spread out beside the waters, and the dew would remain on my harvest.
Job 29:20 My glory would always be renewed, and my bow in my hand would be restored to strength.
Job 29:21 Those who heard me waited patiently, and they kept silent, paying close attention to my counsel.
Job 29:22 After my words, they would not add anything further; and my discourse would fall upon them like gentle rain.
Job 29:23 They waited for me as they would for the rain, and they opened their mouths wide as for the late spring showers.
Job 29:24 If I ever smiled at them, they could hardly believe it, and the light of my countenance settled upon them.
Job 29:25 If I wanted to go to them, I would sit as the first among them; and when I sat, it was like a king surrounded by his army, and I was a comforter to those who mourned.
Job 30:1 But now, those who are younger than I openly ridicule me. Their own fathers I would not have allowed to even sit with the sheepdogs of my own flock.
Job 30:2 The physical strength of their hands was entirely useless; their whole life was considered nothing but refuse and filth.
Job 30:3 They were utterly destitute and barren from hunger, gnawing on roots and scraps in the wilderness, wasting away with calamity and misery.
Job 30:4 They chewed on wild herbs and tree bark, and juniper roots were all the food they had.
Job 30:5 They were driven away from settled places into the middle of ravines, living in caves carved into the earth and among piles of sand.
Job 30:6 They lay hidden in the crevices and caverns of the rocks, among thorns and under nettles.
Job 30:7 They were accustomed to making animal-like noises among the thorns and hiding under the nettles.
Job 30:8 They were the sons of fools and nobodies, utterly erased from the memory of the land, without any name or standing.
Job 30:9 Now, I have become the subject of their mocking songs; I have become like a proverb or a byword to them.
Job 30:10 They detest me and flee far from my presence; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
Job 30:11 Because God has loosened my bowstring and afflicted me, they have also broken the restraint they once had against me.
Job 30:12 On my right, they rise up together, tripping my feet and barricading my pathways as if with surging waves.
Job 30:13 They destroy my paths, they lie in ambush for me, and they gain the victory, and there is no one who will help me.
Job 30:14 Like a breach in a wall or an open gate, they have rushed in upon me; they break into my life as if it were a devastated city.
Job 30:15 My paths have been reduced to nothing; my patience has been swept away like the wind, and my salvation has departed like a fleeting cloud.
Job 30:16 But now, my very soul is melted within me, and days of affliction have taken possession of me.
Job 30:17 At night, my very bones are pierced with pain, and those things which consume me do not rest.
Job 30:18 By their great number, my clothing is vexed and torn, and they have surrounded me like a tightly-woven garment.
Job 30:19 God has thrown me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.
Job 30:20 I cry out to you, God, but you do not hear me; I stand before you, but you do not look at me.
Job 30:21 You have changed your disposition toward me, becoming cruel; with the hardness of your hand, you oppose me.
Job 30:22 You lifted me up, as if setting me upon the wind, and then you dashed me down with powerful waves.
Job 30:23 For I know that you will hand me over to death, to that place appointed for all who live.
Job 30:24 Yet, no one will stretch out their hand against those already consumed; even if they are in ruin, they themselves will be saved.
Job 30:25 I once wept over those who were afflicted, and my soul grieved for the poor.
Job 30:26 I was expecting good to come, but instead, evil came to me; I looked for light, but darkness erupted.
Job 30:27 My inner being is in turmoil without any rest; days of affliction have come upon me.
Job 30:28 I walked about in mourning, without my former strength, rising up in the public assembly, I cried out in agony.
Job 30:29 I have become a brother to jackals and a companion to ostriches, living among the desolate.
Job 30:30 My skin has turned black upon me, and my bones are parched from the heat of my suffering.
Job 30:31 My harp is turned to mourning, and my pipe plays the sound of those who weep.
Job 31:1 I made a solemn promise to my own eyes, to never even let my thoughts dwell on an unmarried woman with lust.
Job 31:2 For what reward would I then expect from God in heaven, what inheritance from the Almighty Lord on high?
Job 31:3 Isn’t there misfortune for evil people? Isn’t there ruin for those who commit injustice?
Job 31:4 Doesn’t God Himself carefully observe all my paths, and meticulously count every single step I take?
Job 31:5 If I have lived a life of deceit, or if my feet have eagerly rushed toward dishonesty,
Job 31:6 then let God weigh me on a truly just scale, and He will know my integrity and sincerity.
Job 31:7 If my steps have ever strayed from the righteous path, or if my heart has followed after what my eyes desired unlawfully, or if any injustice has stained my hands through my actions:
Job 31:8 then let me plant my crops only for another to eat them, and let my whole family line be utterly wiped out.
Job 31:9 If my heart has ever been seduced by another man's wife, and if I have ever lurked near my neighbor’s door with ill intent:
Job 31:10 then let my own wife grind grain for another man, and let another man have relations with her.
Job 31:11 For this kind of act is a most disgraceful crime, indeed, a very great wickedness.
Job 31:12 It is like a consuming fire that burns all the way down to destruction, uprooting and destroying all the fruits of my life.
Job 31:13 If I have ever ignored the just complaints of my male servant or my female servant, when they had a dispute against me:
Job 31:14 what then will I do when God rises up to judge? And when He questions me about it, what answer will I give Him?
Job 31:15 Didn't the very same God who made me in my mother's womb also make them? And didn't the same God form all of us, each one in the womb?
Job 31:16 If I have ever denied the poor what they needed, or if I have caused the eyes of a widow to become weak with desperate longing for help:
Job 31:17 if I have ever eaten my portion of bread alone, and an orphan did not eat from it alongside me:
Job 31:18 (For from my infancy, I was raised with the orphan as if I were a father to them, and from my mother’s womb, the orphan has always been with me in my care and concern):
Job 31:19 if I have ever seen someone perishing because they had no clothing, or a poor person who had nothing to cover themselves with:
Job 31:20 if their loins have not blessed me, meaning if they have not felt relief and gratitude, and if they have not been warmed by the wool from my own sheep:
Job 31:21 if I have ever lifted my hand against an orphan, even when I saw that I had the upper hand and legal advantage in the city gate:
Job 31:22 then let my arm fall from its shoulder, and let it be broken into pieces along with all my bones.
Job 31:23 For I have always regarded God as a looming threat over me, and I could not bear the weight of His judgment for such sins.
Job 31:24 If I ever considered gold to be my strength, or if I said to fine gold, 'You are my ultimate trust and security':
Job 31:25 if I have ever rejoiced greatly over my vast riches, or because my hand had acquired much wealth:
Job 31:26 if I have ever looked at the sun when it shone brightly, or at the moon as it moved clearly through the night sky:
Job 31:27 and in secret, my heart was glad with a forbidden joy, and my mouth kissed my hand in a gesture of idolatry towards them:
Job 31:28 this too would be a most grievous sin of judgment, for I would have denied the great God who is above all creation.
Job 31:29 If I have ever rejoiced at the downfall of someone who hated me, or exulted because evil had befallen him:
Job 31:30 for I have never allowed my mouth to sin by uttering a curse, wishing for his death or destruction.
Job 31:31 If the men of my tent have not said, 'Who can find someone who has not been satisfied with his meat?' meaning, who has not been fed generously by Job:
Job 31:32 the stranger never stayed outside my home, and my door was always open to the traveler.
Job 31:33 If I have ever concealed my wrongdoing like other men do, hiding my iniquity deep within my own heart:
Job 31:34 if I have been too afraid of the great multitude, and troubled more than I ought by the contempt of my relatives, and because of that, I kept silent, and did not go out my door to do justice.
Job 31:35 Oh, that someone would listen to me now! I desire that the Almighty in heaven write down His charges against me in a book.
Job 31:36 Truly, I would carry it on my shoulder, and bind it around myself like a crown of honor.
Job 31:37 I would declare to Him an account of my every step and action, and present it to Him as if I were a prince.
Job 31:38 If my land has ever cried out against me, and if its furrows have wept along with it, indicating I seized it unjustly:
Job 31:39 if I have eaten its produce without paying for it, and if I have oppressed the souls of its laborers:
Job 31:40 then let thistles grow for me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley. Here ends the discourse of Job.
Job 32:1 So these three men stopped answering Job because he was convinced of his own righteousness.
Job 32:2 But Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. His anger burned because Job declared himself righteous before God.
Job 32:3 Furthermore, he was angry with Job's three friends, because they had failed to find a proper answer to Job, and instead had only condemned him.
Job 32:4 So Elihu waited before speaking to Job, because the others were older than him.
Job 32:5 When he saw that the three men had no further answers to offer, he became extremely angry.
Job 32:6 So Elihu, son of Barachel the Buzite, began to speak. He said: 'I am young, and you are elders, so I was respectful and feared to speak my opinion to you.'
Job 32:7 For I thought, 'Surely older men will speak, and the abundance of years will teach wisdom.'
Job 32:8 But truly, there is a spirit within human beings, and the inspiration of the Almighty God gives understanding.
Job 32:9 It is not necessarily the great in stature who are wise, nor do only the aged possess true judgment.
Job 32:10 That is why I said, 'Listen to me; I also will present my opinion to you.'
Job 32:11 For I waited for your speeches, I listened closely to your reasoning, until your discourse was finished.
Job 32:12 I paid close attention to all of you, and indeed, none of you could refute Job or provide a suitable response to his arguments.
Job 32:13 Do not say in your hearts, 'We have found wisdom here; God is the one who will prove him wrong, not a human being.'
Job 32:14 Job's arguments were not directed at you, so I will not answer him using your arguments.
Job 32:15 They were dismayed; they replied no more, having nothing further to say.
Job 32:16 Since I waited and they did not speak, since they stood silent and gave no more replies,
Job 32:17 I will also give my part in answering, and I will make known what I know.
Job 32:18 For I am full of words, and the spirit within me presses upon me.
Job 32:19 My inner being is like new wine that has no vent, like new wineskins that are about to burst.
Job 32:20 I must speak to find relief; I will open my lips and reply.
Job 32:21 I will not show partiality to any man, nor will I flatter any human being.
Job 32:22 For I do not know how long I will endure, and if my Maker will take me away soon.
Job 33:1 Therefore, Job, pay attention to my message. Listen carefully to everything I am about to say.
Job 33:2 Go ahead and speak, if you have anything to say.
Job 33:3 But if you have nothing to say, then listen to me. I will speak words to you that will give you understanding and life.
Job 33:4 God's Spirit made me, and the very breath of the Almighty gave me life.
Job 33:5 If you can, then answer me. Stand here before me and present your case.
Job 33:6 Look, I am just like you, made from clay. I was also formed from the same earth.
Job 33:7 My authority won't terrify you, and my seriousness won't overwhelm you.
Job 33:8 You have spoken these things within my hearing, and I have listened to the sound of your words.
Job 33:9 You said, 'I am pure, without sin. I am spotless and without any wrongdoing.'
Job 33:10 You claim that God found reasons to accuse you, and therefore He considered you His enemy.
Job 33:11 You said He put your foot in a snare and watched all your paths.
Job 33:12 Listen, in this you are not justified, and I will answer you: for God is greater than any human being.
Job 33:13 Why do you argue against Him? It's because He does not respond to all your words.
Job 33:14 God speaks once, and then a second time, though not always repeating the exact same message.
Job 33:15 He speaks through dreams in a night vision, when a deep sleep falls upon people and they are sleeping in their beds.
Job 33:16 Then He opens the ears of men, and by instructing them, He teaches them wisdom and discipline.
Job 33:17 This is to turn a person away from the wrong things he is doing and to free him from his pride.
Job 33:18 He instructs his very self to rescue it from the pit of destruction, and to prevent his life from passing into the realm of the dead.
Job 33:19 He also corrects a person through pain on his sickbed, and his bones are crushed as if by a moth.
Job 33:20 During his illness, food becomes repulsive to him, and his very self rejects his most basic nourishment.
Job 33:21 His flesh wastes away, and his bones, which had been covered, become exposed.
Job 33:22 His very self draws near to decay, and his life approaches the innermost chambers of death.
Job 33:23 If there is an angel with him—one of a thousand—who can declare a person's uprightness,
Job 33:24 Then the angel will have mercy on him and say: 'Deliver him so that he does not go down into destruction; I have found a ransom for him.'
Job 33:25 His flesh will be restored like that of a child, and he will return to the vigor of his youth.
Job 33:26 He will pray to God, and God will be favorable to him. He will see God's face with joy, and God will restore his righteousness to him.
Job 33:27 He will look at others and declare: 'I have sinned, and indeed I have done wrong, and I did not receive what I deserved.'
Job 33:28 God rescued my very self from entering destruction, and my life will see the light of life.
Job 33:29 See, God does all these things three times, with each individual person.
Job 33:30 He does this to bring their very selves back from decay and to illuminate them with the light of the living.
Job 33:31 Pay attention, Job, and listen to me. Be silent, and I will speak.
Job 33:32 But if you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I wish for you to be justified.
Job 33:33 But if not, then listen to me and be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.
Job 34:1 Eliu then continued speaking, saying:
Job 34:2 “Listen to my words, you who are wise, and you who are learned in the ways of God, give heed to what I say.
Job 34:3 For just as the mouth tastes and discerns food, so the ears judge and discern words.
Job 34:4 Let us choose what is right and just for ourselves, and let us together discern what is truly best.
Job 34:5 For Job has said: ‘I am righteous, and God has turned away my judgment, refusing to acknowledge my innocence.
Job 34:6 He has lied, saying: ‘My cause is one of violence and injustice; my wound has been inflicted without any fault or sin on my part.’
Job 34:7 Who is there like Job, who drinks down scorn and anger as if it were water, saturating himself with bitterness?
Job 34:8 He walks and associates with those who commit wickedness, and he keeps company with impious men.
Job 34:9 For he has declared: ‘It will not please a man, even if he strives to run with God, to be righteous.’ This means that striving for God's approval is fruitless.
Job 34:10 Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding and insight: may ungodliness and wickedness be far from God, and may injustice be far from God the Father Almighty.
Job 34:11 But He will surely repay each person for his work, and He will restore to each according to their individual ways and deeds.
Job 34:12 Truly, God will not act impiously, nor will the Almighty ever subvert justice.
Job 34:13 Who else gave Him the earth? Or who founded the world that He now rules? No one.
Job 34:14 If He were to direct His attention to Himself alone, and withdraw His own Spirit and the breath of life back to Himself from all creation,
Job 34:15 then all flesh would perish together instantly, and every human being would return to dust.
Job 34:16 Therefore, if you possess understanding, hear what I am saying, and listen carefully to the voice of my discourse.
Job 34:17 Can one who does not love justice endure? And how can you condemn Him who is righteous, mighty, and perfectly executes justice?
Job 34:18 Is it right to say to a king, ‘You are a renegade!’ or to call rulers, ‘You are impious!’?
Job 34:19 God does not show partiality to princes, nor does He regard a tyrant more than a shepherd, because all are the work of His hands.
Job 34:20 In a moment they will die, and suddenly in the middle of the night, peoples will be troubled and pass away; and the violent one will be taken away without any human hand.
Job 34:21 For His eyes are upon the ways of men, and He considers all their steps and movements.
Job 34:22 There are no dark places, nor is there any shadow of death deep enough for those who commit wickedness to hide themselves there from Him.
Job 34:23 For God does not need to extend His examination further, nor does He summon a man to come before Him for judgment in the way human courts do.
Job 34:24 He crushes many countless individuals, and He raises up others in their place.
Job 34:25 For He knows their works, and therefore He brings the darkness of punishment upon them, and they are crushed.
Job 34:26 He strikes them down as impious men in a place where all can see.
Job 34:27 They deliberately turned away from Him, and they refused to understand all of His ways and commands.
Job 34:28 This means they caused the cry of the poor to reach Him, and He heard the voices of the needy.
Job 34:29 If He Himself grants peace and rest, who then can condemn? If He hides His face, who can behold Him? This applies to both nations and to all individual human beings.
Job 34:30 He allows a hypocritical man to reign as king because of the sins of the people.
Job 34:31 Will anyone say to God: ‘I have received my just punishment, I will not sin again’?
Job 34:32 If I have offended unknowingly, teach me what I did wrong; if I have committed iniquity, I will not add to it further.
Job 34:33 Will God reckon it according to your judgment, because you have resisted Him? For you, not I, choose what you believe; and if you know anything better, speak it now.
Job 34:34 Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hear what I say.
Job 34:35 But Job has spoken with foolish discourse, and his words do not sound like true instruction or wisdom.
Job 34:36 For this reason, I pray to the Father that Job be tested to the very end,
Job 34:37 because he adds transgression to his sin, and in all his words, he provokes us, and challenges God Himself.
Job 35:1 Eliu spoke again, and he said:
Job 35:2 Do you think it is right for you to declare, 'I am more righteous than God?'
Job 35:3 For you have said, 'What profit is there for You, O God, if I do not sin?'
Job 35:4 I will speak to you concerning this, and to your friends who are with you.
Job 35:5 Look up at the universe, and observe it; behold the skies, which are higher than you.
Job 35:6 If you have sinned, how do you harm God? And if your iniquities are multiplied, what do you do to Him?
Job 35:7 If you have acted righteously, what do you give to Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?
Job 35:8 Your wickedness harms only a human being who is like you; and your righteousness helps only a son of man.
Job 35:9 Because of the many oppressions from powerful rulers, people cry out and wail for rescue from violent power.
Job 35:10 Yet no one says, 'Where is God, my Creator, who gives songs of comfort in the darkest night?'
Job 35:11 He who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky, is not questioned.
Job 35:12 There, people will cry out, but God will not hear them because of the arrogance and pride of the wicked.
Job 35:13 Therefore, God does not hear their prayers in vain, for the Almighty does not look upon empty pleas without cause.
Job 35:14 How much more so, when you say, 'God does not judge, He sets aside your cause, and you must just wait for Him.'
Job 35:15 But for now, He does not judge, though judgment is before Him, and you are enduring this trial.
Job 35:16 Therefore, Job vainly opens his mouth, and without true knowledge multiplies his words.
Job 35:17 Have I not spoken to you, to prove that you think yourself more righteous than God?
Job 35:18 You say: 'I suffer much, and I am not heard, nor is there anyone to vindicate me.'
Job 35:19 And Eliu said: 'I will yet speak words from God to show you that my Maker is just.'
Job 35:20 You will be able to learn knowledge from my words, and not as if they came from myself alone.
Job 35:21 Truly, I will speak my discourse without deceit, and there is no falsehood in me.
Job 35:22 But the Lord is powerful in strength, and He possesses knowledge beyond any comparison.
Job 35:23 He does not cast away anyone who trusts in Him; and He executes judgment on all who hope in Him.
Job 35:24 Indeed, He is more powerful than any people, and there is no one who is like Him.
Job 35:25 There is no one who dares to oppose Him; and there is no one who is like Him.
Job 35:26 And who will say to Him: 'What are You doing?' Or who will set himself against Him?
Job 35:27 Remember to praise His work, about which people have sung.
Job 35:28 All humanity has seen it, and from afar they have contemplated it in its height.
Job 35:29 Behold, God is great, excelling in knowledge, and who is from many years ago, that is, eternal.
Job 35:30 He who executes judgment, there is no one like Him.
Job 35:31 There is no one who is like Him in strength, or who can set himself against Him.
Job 35:32 He who executes judgment, there is no one like Him.
Job 35:33 He has put wisdom in their hearts, yet there is no one who is like Him.
Job 35:34 Behold, this One is great, and we do not know Him; His years are beyond number, and there is no one who is like Him.
Job 35:35 Can you truly know His paths, and understand His ways, and yet there is no one who is like Him?
Job 35:36 He who arranges the skies, yet there is no one who is like Him.
Job 35:37 And He who has ordered His works, yet there is no one who is like Him.
Job 35:38 Who can simultaneously understand all the works of God, which exist from eternity, and yet there is no one who is like Him?
Job 35:39 And He who has given them knowledge, yet there is no one who is like Him.
Job 35:40 He who performs great and inscrutable wonders, yet there is no one who is like Him.
Job 36:1 Elihu then continued to speak, saying these things:
Job 36:2 Wait for me for a short while, and I will show you; for I still have more to say, speaking on God’s behalf.
Job 36:3 I will review my wisdom from its very beginning, and with my words, I will prove that my Creator is just.
Job 36:4 Truly, my words are without falsehood, for perfect knowledge will be proven to you.
Job 36:5 God is powerful, and He rejects no one, for He is mighty in the strength of His will.
Job 36:6 He does not save the impious, but He grants justice to the poor.
Job 36:7 He does not turn His eyes away from the just; He sets up kings on their thrones, and establishes them firmly forever.
Job 36:8 If they are held captive in chains, and are bound by the cords of affliction:
Job 36:9 He reveals to them their works, and their transgressions, because they have gone too far.
Job 36:10 He also opens their ears to receive correction, and He speaks so that they might turn away from wickedness.
Job 36:11 If they listen and obey, they will live out their days in prosperity, and their years in honor.
Job 36:12 But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword, and will be consumed by their own folly.
Job 36:13 Those who are hypocritical and cunning provoke God’s wrath, and they will not cry out to Him when they are bound in affliction.
Job 36:14 Their lives will end in disaster, and their time will be spent among the spiritually weak and defiled.
Job 36:15 He delivers the afflicted from their distress through His justice, and opens their ears to hear Him in times of trouble.
Job 36:16 Thus, He will deliver you from the narrow straits of trouble, where there is no firm ground beneath you. Then your rest will be filled with abundance.
Job 36:17 Your cause has been judged as if it were the judgment of the wicked; yet you will receive justice and righteous judgment from God.
Job 36:18 Therefore, do not let your anger lead you into arrogance; be careful lest by many bribes, you are led astray.
Job 36:19 Your cry will not rescue you from affliction, nor will all the mightiest men be able to help you.
Job 36:20 Do not long for the night, when people are suddenly swept away from their places.
Job 36:21 Be careful not to turn toward wickedness, for you have begun to pursue this path after your affliction.
Job 36:22 Behold, God is exalted in His power, and there is no lawgiver like Him.
Job 36:23 Who can examine His ways, or who can say to Him, 'You have done wrong'?
Job 36:24 Remember to magnify His works, of which men have sung praises.
Job 36:25 All mankind has seen them, yet man beholds them from afar.
Job 36:26 Behold, God is great, surpassing our knowledge; the number of His years is immeasurable.
Job 36:27 He draws up the tiny drops of water, and pours out the rains like surging floods.
Job 36:28 which distill from the clouds, and fall as rain upon many people.
Job 36:29 If He chooses to spread out the clouds like His canopy, and to illuminate their farthest reaches.
Job 36:30 Behold, He extends His light over them, and He covers the foundations of the sea.
Job 36:31 For by these —elements of nature— He judges nations, and provides food for many people.
Job 36:32 He holds the lightning bolts in His hands, and commands them where to strike.
Job 36:33 His thunder announces its presence —referring to the lightning— proclaiming that it is His own possession, and speaks of its rising power.
Job 37:1 At this, my heart trembles in awe, and it is shaken from its place.
Job 37:2 Listen closely, listen to the rumbling roar of God’s voice, and the sound of it as it proceeds from His mouth.
Job 37:3 God causes His lightning to streak across the entire sky, and its light flashes to the very ends of the earth.
Job 37:4 After this, the thunder will roar; God will make it thunder with the majestic sound of His voice. And no one can stop it once His voice is heard.
Job 37:5 God thunders with His voice in a wonderful way, for He does great and unfathomable things.
Job 37:6 He commands the snow to fall upon the earth, and the winter rain, and the downpour of His great power.
Job 37:7 By His hand, God stops all men from their work, so that each one may reflect on what he has done.
Job 37:8 The wild beasts will enter their lairs, and will stay in their dens.
Job 37:9 From the deep clouds comes the tempest, and from the North comes the bitter cold.
Job 37:10 At the breath of God, frost is given, and the vast expanses of water become hard ice.
Job 37:11 The grain yearns for the clouds to bring rain, yet the clouds also scatter forth their light—the lightning.
Job 37:12 The clouds move about in every direction, wherever His will leads them, to fulfill every command He gives them across the surface of the whole earth.
Job 37:13 He causes them to appear either for a specific region or people, or for His own land, or for any other particular purpose He has given them.
Job 37:14 Listen to this, O Job; stand still and contemplate the wonderful works of God.
Job 37:15 Do you know when God commands the rains to come, so that they might reveal the light of His cloud—the lightning?
Job 37:16 Do you understand the vast paths of the clouds, and the perfect knowledge of Him who directs them?
Job 37:17 Why are your garments warm, when the earth is swept by the south wind?
Job 37:18 Can you, then, create the skies with Him, which are as firm as a cast bronze mirror?
Job 37:19 Tell us what we should say to Him, for we are blinded by His glory and do not know what words to speak.
Job 37:20 Can it be told to God what I would speak? Or if a man speaks, will he not be consumed?
Job 37:21 Now, men cannot see the light, for the air is thickened with hailstones turned to ice.
Job 37:22 From the north comes a golden splendor, and around God is terrible majesty.
Job 37:23 We cannot comprehend the Almighty; He is great in strength, and in judgment, and in justice, and with unspeakable goodness He does not afflict without cause.
Job 37:24 Therefore, men will fear Him, and all who consider themselves wise will not be able to comprehend Him.
Job 38:1 But the Lord responded to Job from a great whirlwind. He said to him:
Job 38:2 Who is this person who clouds wise counsel with words that show no understanding?
Job 38:3 Prepare yourself like a strong man ready for battle. I will ask you questions, and you must answer Me.
Job 38:4 Where were you when I laid the very foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you truly possess understanding.
Job 38:5 Who was it that determined its dimensions—if you truly know? Or who stretched out a measuring line to mark its boundaries?
Job 38:6 Upon what were its supporting columns fixed and solidified? Or who was it that carefully laid its foundational cornerstone,
Job 38:7 while the morning stars sang together in praise, and all the spiritual beings — the sons of God — shouted aloud with joy?
Job 38:8 Who was it that enclosed the vast sea with doors, as it burst forth from the earth as if from a womb?
Job 38:9 When I used the clouds as its covering garment, and wrapped it in thick, dark mist like swaddling clothes?
Job 38:10 I established its precise boundaries with My decree, and placed strong bars and mighty doors to contain it;
Job 38:11 and I declared: 'You may come this far, but you shall not advance any further. Here, your proud, swelling waves will be broken and subdued.'
Job 38:12 Have you, since your birth as a human, ever commanded the morning to appear, or shown the dawn its proper place to rise?
Job 38:13 Have you ever taken hold of the very edges of the earth to shake them, or dislodged the wicked from its surface through such an action?
Job 38:14 The form of the earth is changed as clay is molded by a seal, and its features become distinct, like a well-formed garment.
Job 38:15 From the wicked, their light and prosperity will be taken away, and their powerful arm — their strength and pride — will be utterly broken.
Job 38:16 Have you ever ventured into the deepest parts of the ocean, or walked in the farthest, hidden recesses of the primordial deep?
Job 38:17 Have the gates of death ever been opened for you, revealing their secrets, or have the dark, shadowy doors of the underworld unveiled themselves to you?
Job 38:18 Have you truly comprehended the vast expanse of the earth? Tell Me, if you claim to know everything.
Job 38:19 Along what pathway does light truly dwell, and where is the specific dwelling place of darkness?
Job 38:20 Are you able to guide each—light and darkness—to its proper boundaries, and do you comprehend the pathways within its own domain?
Job 38:21 Did you know all of this then, perhaps because you were already born and had lived for many days?
Job 38:22 Have you ever entered the vast storehouses of snow, or beheld the immense treasuries where hail is kept,
Job 38:23 which I have prepared and reserved for times of distress, for the day of battle and cosmic warfare?
Job 38:24 By what unseen pathway is light distributed and scattered across the sky, and by what mechanism is heat diffused over the entire earth?
Job 38:25 Who has determined the course for the most torrential rains, and who has forged a specific pathway for the lightning bolt that accompanies thunder?
Job 38:26 causing rain to fall even upon the earth where no man resides, in the desolate wilderness where no mortal human dwells;
Job 38:27 so that He might fill the desolate, untraveled wasteland with water, and cause even the most basic green grass to sprout forth?
Job 38:28 Who is the true father of the rain, bringing it into existence? Or who gave birth to the countless tiny drops of dew?
Job 38:29 From whose mighty womb did the ice emerge? And who brought forth the frost from the very atmosphere?
Job 38:30 The waters harden like stone, becoming solid ice, and the great deep — even the primordial water bodies — becomes frozen in its usual flow.
Job 38:31 Are you able to bind together the beautiful cluster of stars known as the Pleiades, or can you loosen the tight bands that hold the constellation Arcturus in its course?
Job 38:32 Do you bring forth the morning star, Lucifer, at its appointed time, and do you cause the evening star to rise over all the inhabitants of the earth?
Job 38:33 Do you understand the cosmic laws and ordinances that govern the universe, and can you establish their effects and rules here on earth?
Job 38:34 Can you raise your voice into the clouds to command them, and would a torrent of water obediently cover you upon your word?
Job 38:35 Can you dispatch lightning bolts, and will they obediently go forth, returning to you to report, 'Here we are, ready to do your bidding'?
Job 38:36 Who has endowed humanity with wisdom in their innermost being? Or who has granted the rooster its natural instinct and understanding?
Job 38:37 Who possesses the wisdom to count the clouds and determine their celestial purpose? And who can silence the harmonious 'music' of the universe when it produces rain?
Job 38:38 When the loose dust of the earth becomes so dry that it forms a solid mass, and the soil's clods cling tightly together due to extreme drought.
Job 38:39 Are you able to hunt for the lioness to secure her prey, and can you fully satisfy the hungry appetite of her young cubs?
Job 38:40 when they lie hidden in their lairs, and patiently lurk in their dens, waiting for their quarry?
Job 39:1 Do you know when the wild deer give birth to their fawns among the rocks? Or have you carefully observed the birth of the hinds, the female deer?
Job 39:2 Have you precisely counted the months of their pregnancy? And do you truly know the exact moment they will give birth?
Job 39:3 They curve themselves down to give birth. They labor and deliver their young, releasing their cries.
Job 39:4 Their young grow strong and fat. They go out to graze, then they depart and do not return to their mothers.
Job 39:5 Who has set the wild ass free? Who has loosened the chains from the wild ass, allowing it to roam?
Job 39:6 I have given the wild ass its home in the wilderness, and its dwelling place in the barren, salty land.
Job 39:7 It despises the crowded city, and it does not hear the shouts of the driver forcing it to work.
Job 39:8 It wanders over the mountain pastures, searching for every green plant it can find.
Job 39:9 Will the wild ox choose to serve you? Or will it remain by your feeding trough?
Job 39:10 Can you bind the wild ox to a plow so that it will cut furrows behind you?
Job 39:11 Will you place your trust in its immense strength? Will you leave your hard work entirely to it?
Job 39:12 Will you believe that it will return to you after leaving, and gather your grain into your threshing floor?
Job 39:13 The wing of the ostrich is like the wings of the heron and the hawk.
Job 39:14 When it abandons its eggs on the ground, you, oh Job, would actually try to keep them warm on the dust.
Job 39:15 It forgets that a foot might crush them, or that a wild animal of the field might break them.
Job 39:16 It is hardened toward its own children, as if they were not its own. It has labored in vain, without any fear for them.
Job 39:17 For God deprived the ostrich of wisdom, and did not give it understanding.
Job 39:18 But when the moment comes for it to run, it raises its wings high; it mocks the horse and its rider.
Job 39:19 Do you bestow strength upon the horse? Or do you adorn its neck with a powerful mane and the sound of its neigh?
Job 39:20 Do you make it leap like a locust? The majestic snorting from its nostrils is terrifying.
Job 39:21 With its hoof, it paws the ground, and it exults with boldness. It charges directly into armed men.
Job 39:22 It despises fear and does not flinch from the sword.
Job 39:23 Above it, the quiver rattles. The spear and shield flash.
Job 39:24 Fierce and raging, it seems to devour the ground. It cannot believe that the trumpet has sounded the charge.
Job 39:25 When it hears the war trumpet, it cries out, “Aha!” From afar, it scents the battle, the exhortations of the commanders, and the war cry of the army.
Job 39:26 Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars upward, spreading its wings to the south wind?
Job 39:27 Is it at your command that the eagle rises high and builds its nest in the lofty, inaccessible places?
Job 39:28 It dwells among the crags and stays on the jagged, inaccessible cliffs.
Job 39:29 From there, it watches for its food, and its eyes spot prey from far away.
Job 39:30 Its young ones drink blood. Wherever a carcass is, there it is immediately present.
Job 39:31 And the Lord answered Job from the midst of a whirlwind, saying:
Job 39:32 Will you contend with the Almighty? Let him who argues with God answer Him now.
Job 39:33 And Job answered the Lord, saying:
Job 39:34 What can I answer, I who am so unworthy before you? I will place my hand over my mouth in silence.
Job 39:35 I have spoken once, but now I retract it. And if I were to speak a second time, I would add nothing further.
Job 39:36 And the Lord answered Job again from the midst of the whirlwind, saying:
Job 39:37 Gird your loins like a man of strength! I will question you, and you must answer me.
Job 39:38 Will you really nullify my judgment? And will you condemn me in order to justify yourself?
Job 39:39 Do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like His?
Job 39:40 Adorn yourself with splendor and majesty, and clothe yourself with strength and glory.
Job 40:1 And the Lord responded to Job, saying:
Job 40:2 Will the one who disputes with the Almighty now continue? Let the one who would argue against God answer Him now.
Job 40:3 And Job responded to the Lord, saying:
Job 40:4 Shall I speak any further, I who have already spoken too much? Or should I place my hand over my mouth?
Job 40:5 I have said one thing, and I will not add to it; I have said another, and I will not repeat it.
Job 40:6 And the Lord responded to Job from out of the whirlwind, saying:
Job 40:7 Gird your loins like a man; I will question you, and you must answer Me.
Job 40:8 Will you then annul My judgment? Will you condemn Me, so that you may be justified?
Job 40:9 Do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like His?
Job 40:10 Adorn yourself with splendor and supreme majesty; clothe yourself with strength and glory.
Job 40:11 Unleash the full force of your furious anger; look upon everyone who is proud and humble him.
Job 40:12 Look upon all the proud and confound them; crush the wicked in their place.
Job 40:13 Hide them all in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit of the grave.
Job 40:14 Then I Myself will confess that your own right hand can save you.
Job 40:15 Look now at Behemoth, whom I made just as I made you; he eats grass like an ox.
Job 40:16 His strength is in his loins, and his power is in the muscles of his belly.
Job 40:17 He makes his tail stiff like a cedar tree; the sinews of his thighs are intertwined.
Job 40:18 His bones are like tubes of bronze; his cartilage is like plates of iron.
Job 40:19 He is the first among God's creations; only his Maker can bring His sword against him.
Job 40:20 The mountains yield their grass for him; all the beasts of the field play near him.
Job 40:21 He sleeps under the shade, in the secret hiding place of the reeds, and in marshy places.
Job 40:22 The shade of trees covers him; the willows by the brook surround him.
Job 40:23 See, he drinks up a river without concern, and he is confident that even the Jordan can flow into his mouth.
Job 40:24 Can anyone take him by the eyes with a hook? Or pierce his nose with a snare?
Job 40:25 Can you pull out Leviathan with a fishhook? Or tie down his tongue with a rope?
Job 40:26 Can you put a ring in his nose? Or pierce his jaw with a hook?
Job 40:27 Will he multiply supplications to you? Or will he speak soft words to you?
Job 40:28 Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him as your perpetual servant?
Job 40:29 Can you play with him as with a bird? Or bind him for your servant girls?
Job 40:30 Will traders barter for him? Will merchants divide him up?
Job 40:31 Can you fill his skin with harpoons? Or his head with fishermen's spears?
Job 40:32 Lay your hand upon him; remember the battle, and do not try again.
Job 41:1 Can you pull out Leviathan with a fishhook, or tie his tongue with a rope?
Job 41:2 Can you put a rope through his nose, or pierce his jaw with a spike?
Job 41:3 Will he often beg you for mercy, or speak gentle words to you?
Job 41:4 Will he make a covenant with you, so you can take him as your slave for all time?
Job 41:5 Will you play with him as if he were a bird, or tie him up for your servant girls to keep?
Job 41:6 Will trading partners make a feast out of him? Will merchants divide him up for sale?
Job 41:7 Can you fill his skin with fishing darts, or his head with harpoons?
Job 41:8 Try to lay your hand on him. You will remember the battle, and you will not try again.
Job 41:9 Look, any hope of yours will be disappointed, and you will be overthrown by his mere presence.
Job 41:10 No one is so fierce that he would dare to provoke him. Who then would dare to stand before my face? — This is God speaking, implying that if you cannot face Leviathan, you certainly cannot face God.
Job 41:11 Who has ever given Me anything first, that I should have to repay him? Everything under all of creation is mine.
Job 41:12 I will not keep silent about him, or about his mighty strength, or his perfectly-formed ability to resist.
Job 41:13 Who can strip off his outer hide, or penetrate his double armor?
Job 41:14 Who can open the doors of his mouth? His terrifying teeth are all around it.
Job 41:15 His body is like cast metal shields, joined together with tight seals, like stones.
Job 41:16 One scale is joined tightly to another, so no breath can pass between them.
Job 41:17 Each scale clings to the next, holding so tightly they cannot be separated.
Job 41:18 His sneeze flashes like fire, and his eyes are like the bright rays of dawn.
Job 41:19 From his mouth burst forth torches, and sparks of fire shoot out.
Job 41:20 Smoke pours from his nostrils, like from a boiling pot or a burning cauldron.
Job 41:21 His breath sets coals ablaze, and flame comes forth from his mouth.
Job 41:22 Strength dwells in his neck, and terror dances before his face.
Job 41:23 The parts of his flesh cling together tightly; if you strike him, he will not be moved.
Job 41:24 His heart is hard as stone, and as immovable as the lower millstone.
Job 41:25 When he rises up, the mighty will be afraid, and when terrified, they will be utterly dismayed.
Job 41:26 If a sword strikes him, it will not hold. Spears, javelins, and armor are useless against him.
Job 41:27 He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.
Job 41:28 An arrow will not make him flee; sling-stones turned against him become like stubble.
Job 41:29 He regards a club as straw, and he laughs at the shaking spear.
Job 41:30 Beneath him are the rays of the sun (as he moves through the water), and all gold beneath him he treats as mud.
Job 41:31 He makes the deep sea boil like a pot, and makes the sea like a frothing ointment.
Job 41:32 Behind him, a shining path appears, and he makes the deep seem to grow old with his passage.
Job 41:33 There is no power on earth that can be compared to him, for he was made to fear nothing.
Job 41:34 He looks down on all who are haughty, for he is king over all the children of pride.
Job 42:1 Then Job answered the Lord and said:
Job 42:2 I know that you can accomplish all things, and no plan of yours can be thwarted.
Job 42:3 —Who am I, that I should obscure your divine counsel without true knowledge?— Therefore, I have spoken unwisely, speaking of things that utterly exceeded my comprehension.
Job 42:4 —You said to me, "Listen, and I will speak; I will question you, and you respond to me."
Job 42:5 I had heard of you only by the hearing of my ear, but now my very own eyes see you.
Job 42:6 Therefore, I utterly condemn myself for my prior words, and I repent in dust and ashes.
Job 42:7 But after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, He said to Eliphaz the Temanite: "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, because you have not spoken what is right before me, as my servant Job has."
Job 42:8 Therefore, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his intercession so that your folly may not be counted against you. For you have not spoken what is right to me, as my servant Job has."
Job 42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, Baldad the Shuhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord had commanded them, and the Lord accepted Job's intercession.
Job 42:10 The Lord also turned Job's captivity to repentance—meaning He restored Job's fortunes and peace—when Job prayed for his friends. And the Lord doubled all that Job had possessed before.
Job 42:11 Then all his brothers and all his sisters came to him, and all who had known him previously. They ate bread with him in his house, and they mourned with him and comforted him concerning all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him. Each of them also gave him a piece of money and a gold earring.
Job 42:12 Now the Lord blessed Job's latter end even more than his beginning. And Job had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys.
Job 42:13 He also had seven sons and three daughters.
Job 42:14 He named the first daughter Day, the second Cassia, and the third Cornustibii.
Job 42:15 There were no women found throughout the entire land as beautiful as Job's daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
Job 42:16 After these things, Job lived one hundred and forty years, and he saw his children and his children's children, even to the fourth generation.
Job 42:17 And so he died, an old man and full of days.
Psalms 1:1 Truly blessed is the man who does not follow the advice of the ungodly, nor stands in the path of sinners, nor sits in the seat of those who mock or spread moral corruption.

Psalms 73:4 They have no regard for death, and they live free from all harm.
Psalms 73:5 They have no struggles, and they aren’t struck down with others.
Psalms 73:6 Therefore, pride grips them. They conceal their sin and their wickedness.

Psalms 74:12 You smashed the sea monster’s heads; you gave them as food to the Ethiopians.
Psalms 74:13 You broke open the fountains and the torrents; you dried up the river Ethan.
Psalms 74:14 The day is yours, and the night is yours; you created the dawn and the sun.
Psalms 74:15 You made all the boundaries of the earth; you made the summer and the spring.

Psalms 77:1 Listen to me, my people, and pay attention to my law.
Psalms 77:2 I will speak to you in a parable; I will tell you the mysteries of the past.
Psalms 77:3 What we have heard and known, our fathers have told us.
Psalms 77:4 We will not hide it from our children, from their generation to the next.
Psalms 77:5 We will tell of the Lord's praises and virtues, and His wondrous works.
Psalms 77:6 He established a covenant with Jacob, and the law was made for Israel.
Psalms 77:7 He commanded our fathers to teach them to their children, so that the next generation might know.
Psalms 77:8 The children who would be born and grow up, so they can tell their children.
Psalms 77:9 They must put their hope in God, never forgetting the works of God, and keeping His commandments.
Psalms 77:10 They will not become like their fathers, a perverse and rebellious generation.
Psalms 77:11 A generation that did not keep their hearts right with God, and their spirit did not believe in Him.
Psalms 77:12 The sons of Ephraim, skilled with the bow, turned back in the day of battle.
Psalms 77:13 They did not keep the covenant of God, and they refused to walk in His law.
Psalms 77:14 They forgot His benefits, and the wonders He showed them.
Psalms 77:15 He performed miracles before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Zoan.
Psalms 77:16 He split the sea and led them through, and made the waters stand like a wall.
Psalms 77:17 He led them with a cloud by day and with the light of fire all night.
Psalms 77:18 He split the rocks in the desert and gave them drink as from a great depth.
Psalms 77:19 He brought water out of the rock and made the waters run down like rivers.
Psalms 77:20 Yet they continued to sin against Him, provoking the Most High in the desert.
Psalms 77:21 They tested God in their hearts by asking for food to satisfy their craving.
Psalms 77:22 They spoke against God, and said: "Can God prepare a table in the desert?"
Psalms 77:23 Behold, He struck the rock, and waters flowed out, and streams overflowed. Can He also give bread, or prepare a table for His people?
Psalms 77:24 Therefore the Lord heard them and was angry, and fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger went up against Israel.
Psalms 77:25 Because they did not believe in God, nor did they trust in His salvation.
Psalms 77:26 He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of the heavens.
Psalms 77:27 He rained down manna for them to eat and gave them the bread of heaven.
Psalms 77:28 Man ate the bread of the angels; He sent them food in abundance.
Psalms 77:29 He brought the south wind from the heavens and by His power brought in the south wind.
Psalms 77:30 He rained meat on them like dust and winged birds like the sand of the sea.
Psalms 77:31 He let them fall in the midst of their camp, around their dwellings.
Psalms 77:32 So they ate and were well filled, and He gave them what they craved.
Psalms 77:33 They were not disappointed in their desire; while their food was still in their mouths.
Psalms 77:34 The anger of God arose against them, and He killed the fattest of them and struck down the chosen men of Israel.
Psalms 77:35 In all these things they still sinned and did not believe in His wonders.
Psalms 77:36 So their days were spent in futility, and their years in haste.
Psalms 77:37 When He killed them, they sought Him, and returned and sought God.
Psalms 77:38 They remembered that God was their rock and that the Most High God was their Redeemer.
Psalms 77:39 But they flattered Him with their mouths, and their tongues lied to Him.
Psalms 77:40 For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, nor were they faithful to His covenant.
Psalms 77:41 But He, being merciful, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them.
Psalms 77:42 He often restrained His anger and did not stir up all His wrath.
Psalms 77:43 He remembered that they were flesh, a wind that passes and does not return.
Psalms 77:44 How often they provoked Him in the desert, and grieved Him in the wasteland?
Psalms 77:45 They turned back and tested God, and vexed the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms 77:46 They did not remember His hand or the day when He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psalms 77:47 How He performed His signs in Egypt and His wonders in the plain of Zoan.
Psalms 77:48 He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink their streams.
Psalms 77:49 He sent among them swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that destroyed them.
Psalms 77:50 He gave their crops to the caterpillar and their labor to the locust.
Psalms 77:51 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
Psalms 77:52 He gave over their livestock to the hail and their possessions to the fire.
Psalms 77:53 He sent against them the heat of His anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels.
Psalms 77:54 He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.
Psalms 77:55 He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first issue of their strength in the tents of Ham.
Psalms 77:56 Then He led forth His people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalms 77:57 He led them safely, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalms 77:58 He brought them to the border of His holy land, to the mountain which His right hand had won.
Psalms 77:59 He drove out the nations before them; He divided the land to them as an inheritance by lot.
Psalms 77:60 He made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
Psalms 77:61 Then the Lord awoke as one from sleep, like a warrior refreshed with wine.
Psalms 77:62 He struck His enemies in the back; He put them to everlasting shame.
Psalms 77:63 He rejected the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
Psalms 77:64 But He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.
Psalms 77:65 He built His sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth that He has established forever.
Psalms 77:66 He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds.
Psalms 77:67 From following the ewes with young, He brought him to shepherd Jacob His people and Israel His inheritance.
Psalms 77:68 So he shepherded them with a blameless heart and guided them by his skillful hand.
Psalms 78:1 Pay attention, my people, and listen to my law. Open your ears to the words I speak.
Psalms 78:2 I will use parables when I speak; I will speak old stories.
Psalms 78:3 I will tell you all that we have heard, and have learned from our fathers.
Psalms 78:4 We won’t hide these truths from our children, but we will tell them to the next generation.
Psalms 78:5 We will tell how the Lord is worthy of praise, of His mighty deeds and the miracles that He did.
Psalms 78:6 He established a covenant with Jacob and gave His law to Israel. He commanded our ancestors to teach these things to their children,
Psalms 78:7 so that the next generation would know them— the children yet to be born. They would tell their own children.
Psalms 78:8 Then they would put their hope in God, never forget the works of God, and always keep His commandments.
Psalms 78:9 They would not be like their ancestors, a rebellious and stubborn generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
Psalms 78:10 The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows and arrows, turned their backs in battle.
Psalms 78:11 They did not keep God’s covenant, and they refused to obey His law.
Psalms 78:12 They forgot His deeds and the miracles that He had shown them.
Psalms 78:13 He performed miracles in front of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Zoan.
Psalms 78:14 He divided the sea and led them through, and He made the waters stand like walls.
Psalms 78:15 He led them with a cloud by day, and with the light of fire all night.
Psalms 78:16 He split rocks in the desert and gave them water as from the depths of the sea.
Psalms 78:17 He caused water to flow from the rock, and made waters run down like rivers.
Psalms 78:18 But they continued to sin against Him; they provoked the Most High in the desert.
Psalms 78:19 They tested God in their hearts, asking for food to satisfy their desires.
Psalms 78:20 They spoke against God, saying, “Can God really prepare a table in the desert?
Psalms 78:21 When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams overflowed, but can He also give us bread, or supply meat for His people?”
Psalms 78:22 When the Lord heard them, He was angry. Fire blazed up against Jacob, and wrath rose against Israel,
Psalms 78:23 because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in His salvation.
Psalms 78:24 Yet He commanded the clouds above, and opened the doors of the sky.
Psalms 78:25 He rained down manna for them to eat, giving them the bread of the heavens.
Psalms 78:26 Humans ate the food of angels; He sent them food in abundance.
Psalms 78:27 He sent an east wind from the sky, and by His power brought in the south wind.
Psalms 78:28 He rained down meat on them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the sea.
Psalms 78:29 He made the birds fall in the middle of their camp, all around their tents.
Psalms 78:30 They ate and were fully satisfied; He gave them what they craved.
Psalms 78:31 But before they could stop eating, and before their cravings were satisfied,
Psalms 78:32 God’s anger rose against them. He killed the strongest among them, and struck down the finest men of Israel.
Psalms 78:33 In spite of all this, they kept sinning; they did not believe in His wonders.
Psalms 78:34 So He brought their days to an end like a breath, and their years in terror.
Psalms 78:35 When He killed them, they sought Him; they repented and earnestly sought God.
Psalms 78:36 Then they remembered that God was their rock, that God Most High was their redeemer.
Psalms 78:37 But they only flattered Him with their mouths; they lied to Him with their tongues.
Psalms 78:38 Their hearts were not sincere toward Him; they were not faithful to His covenant.
Psalms 78:39 But He, being compassionate, forgave their sin and did not destroy them; He often held back His anger, and did not stir up all His wrath.
Psalms 78:40 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and does not return.
Psalms 78:41 How often they defied Him in the desert, how often they grieved Him in the wilderness!
Psalms 78:42 Again and again they tested God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms 78:43 They did not remember His power, nor the day when He redeemed them from the oppressor.
Psalms 78:44 He displayed His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the plain of Zoan.
Psalms 78:45 He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink from their streams.
Psalms 78:46 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that destroyed them.
Psalms 78:47 He gave their crops to the locusts, and the fruit of their labor to the grasshoppers.
Psalms 78:48 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-fig trees with frost.
Psalms 78:49 He gave over their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to the lightning.
Psalms 78:50 He unleashed against them the heat of His anger, His wrath, indignation, and trouble—a band of destroying angels.
Psalms 78:51 He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their lives from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.
Psalms 78:52 He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
Psalms 78:53 But He led out His people like a flock; He guided them like a flock through the desert.
Psalms 78:54 He led them safely, and they were not afraid, while the sea engulfed their enemies.
Psalms 78:55 He brought them to the border of His holy land, to the mountain His right hand had won.
Psalms 78:56 He drove out the nations before them, and apportioned their land as an inheritance by lot.
Psalms 78:57 He made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
Psalms 78:58 But they tested and defied God Most High, and did not keep His decrees.
Psalms 78:59 Like their ancestors, they turned back and were faithless; they were like a treacherous bow.
Psalms 78:60 The men of Ephraim, armed with bows, turned back in the day of battle.
Psalms 78:61 They did not keep God’s covenant and refused to live by His law.
Psalms 78:62 They forgot His deeds and the wonders He had shown them.
Psalms 78:63 He performed miracles in Egypt, His wonders in the plain of Zoan.
Psalms 78:64 He turned their rivers to blood, and they could not drink from their streams.
Psalms 78:65 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that destroyed them.
Psalms 78:66 He gave their crops to the locusts, and the fruit of their labor to the grasshoppers.
Psalms 78:67 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-fig trees with frost.
Psalms 78:68 He gave their cattle over to the hail, and their flocks to the lightning.
Psalms 78:69 He unleashed against them the heat of His anger, His wrath, indignation, and trouble—a band of destroying angels.
Psalms 78:70 He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their lives from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.
Psalms 78:71 He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
Psalms 78:72 But He led out His people like a flock; He guided them like a flock through the desert.
Psalms 78:73 He led them safely, and they were not afraid, while the sea engulfed their enemies.
Psalms 78:74 He brought them to the border of His holy land, to the mountain His right hand had won.
Psalms 78:75 He drove out the nations before them, and apportioned their land as an inheritance by lot.
Psalms 78:76 He made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
Psalms 78:77 Then He turned away and abandoned them, and did not give them any more help.
Psalms 78:78 So He was angry with Israel, and utterly rejected them.
Psalms 78:79 He abandoned the tabernacle in Shiloh, the tent He had pitched among men.
Psalms 78:80 He allowed His strength to be captured, and His glory to be in the hands of the enemy.
Psalms 78:81 He gave His people over to the sword, and was not concerned about His inheritance.
Psalms 78:82 Fire devoured their young men, and their young women were not praised.
Psalms 78:83 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows were not lamented.
Psalms 78:84 Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a warrior refreshed by wine.
Psalms 78:85 He struck his enemies in the rear, and put them to everlasting shame.
Psalms 78:86 He rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
Psalms 78:87 but He chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which He loved.
Psalms 78:88 He built His sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which He established forever.
Psalms 78:89 He chose David His servant, and took him from the sheep pens.
Psalms 78:90 From tending the ewes with their young, He brought him to shepherd Jacob His people, Israel His inheritance.
Psalms 78:91 He shepherded them with a pure heart, and guided them with skillful hands.
Psalms 79:1 A Psalm by Asaph. O God, gentiles have entered into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple and have made Jerusalem into a pile of rubble.
Psalms 79:2 They left the corpses of your servants as food for the birds in the sky. They left the flesh of your saints for the beasts of the land.
Psalms 79:3 They have shed their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one who would bury them.
Psalms 79:4 We have become the mockery of our neighbors, a laughingstock and a joke to those around us.
Psalms 79:5 How long, O Lord? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like a fire?
Psalms 79:6 Pour out your wrath on the gentiles who do not know you, and on the kingdoms that have not called on your name.
Psalms 79:7 For they have consumed Jacob, and they have laid waste his place.
Psalms 79:8 Do not remember our former iniquities. Let your mercies quickly come to meet us, for we have become very poor.
Psalms 79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, and for the glory of your name, deliver us. Be gracious to our sins for your name's sake.
Psalms 79:10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the vengeance for the blood of your servants, which has been poured out, be made known among the nations before our eyes.
Psalms 79:11 Let the groaning of the prisoners come before you. According to the greatness of your arm, preserve the sons of death.
Psalms 79:12 And repay our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom the reproach with which they have reproached you, O Lord.
Psalms 79:13 But we, your people, and the sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will announce your praise from generation to generation.
Psalms 80:1 For the leader; for the presses. A Psalm. Of Asaph.
Psalms 80:2 O Shepherd of Israel, give ear, You who lead Joseph like a sheep.
Psalms 80:3 You who sit above the cherubim, be revealed.
Psalms 80:4 Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up Your power, and come to save us.
Psalms 80:5 Turn us back, O God, and show us Your face, and we shall be saved.
Psalms 80:6 O Lord God of hosts, how long will You be angry with Your servant's prayer?
Psalms 80:7 You have fed us with the bread of tears, and given us tears to drink in full measure.
Psalms 80:8 You have made us a source of conflict for our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.
Psalms 80:9 Turn us back, O God of hosts, and show us Your face, and we shall be saved.
Psalms 80:10 You brought a vine out of Egypt; You cast out the nations and planted it.
Psalms 80:11 You were the guide of its journey; You planted its roots, and it filled the earth.
Psalms 80:12 Its shadow covered the mountains, and its branches the cedars of God.
Psalms 80:13 It sent out its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the river.
Psalms 80:14 Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by the way pluck it?
Psalms 80:15 The boar from the forest ravages it, and the wild beast devours it.
Psalms 80:16 Turn, God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine.
Psalms 80:17 Protect that which Your right hand has planted, and the son of man whom You have strengthened for Yourself.
Psalms 80:18 It is burned with fire, and cut down at the rebuke of Your countenance.
Psalms 80:19 Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, and upon the son of man whom You have strengthened for Yourself.
Psalms 80:20 Then we will not turn back from You; You will revive us, and we will call upon Your name.
Psalms 80:21 O Lord God of hosts, turn us back; show Your face, and we shall be saved.

Psalms 81:3 My soul longs, and faints, for the courts of the Lord.
Psalms 81:4 My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.

Psalms 81:7 Blessed are those who dwell in your house, O Lord: they shall praise you for ever and ever.
Psalms 81:8 Blessed is the man whose help comes from you: He has arranged ascensions in his heart.

Psalms 81:11 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
Psalms 81:12 Behold our protector, O God: and look upon the face of your Christ.
Psalms 81:13 For one day in your courts is better than a thousand.
Psalms 81:14 I have chosen to be a castaway in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners.

Psalms 82:7 But you will die as mere men do. You'll fall as any prince would.
Psalms 82:8 Arise, God, and judge the earth, for You will inherit all the nations.
Psalms 83:1 The song of Psalm 83 by Asaph.
Psalms 83:2 O God, who is like You? Don't be silent, don't hold back, O God.
Psalms 83:3 Your enemies are rising up, and those who hate You are growing in power.
Psalms 83:4 They conspire against Your people. They plot against those dedicated to You.
Psalms 83:5 They say, “Come, let's destroy them. Let's wipe out their nation so that Israel is forgotten forever.”
Psalms 83:6 They all agree and make an alliance against You,
Psalms 83:7 The tents of Edom, the Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes;
Psalms 83:8 Gebal, Ammon, Amalek, Philistia, and the inhabitants of Tyre.
Psalms 83:9 Assyria has also joined them, supporting the descendants of Lot.
Psalms 83:10 Do to them what You did to Midian and Sisera, what You did to Jabin at the Kishon River.
Psalms 83:11 They were defeated at Endor, and they rotted away, polluting the land.
Psalms 83:12 Treat their leaders as You treated Oreb, Zeb, Zeba, and Zalmunna, all of their leaders.
Psalms 83:13 They said, “Let’s take possession of God's territory!”
Psalms 83:14 O my God, make them like a rolling wheel, like chaff before the wind.
Psalms 83:15 As fire consumes a forest, as a flame sets mountains ablaze,
Psalms 83:16 So shall You pursue them with Your storm. In Your wrath, terrify them!
Psalms 83:17 Fill their faces with shame. Then they will seek Your name, O Lord.
Psalms 83:18 May they be ashamed and terrified forever. May they be disgraced and destroyed.
Psalms 83:19 Then they will know that You alone are the Lord. You alone are the Most High over all the earth.
Psalms 84:1 For the leader; a psalm for the sons of Korah.

Psalms 84:10 Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; listen, God of Jacob.
Psalms 84:11 O God, our protector, look upon us; and look upon the face of your Christ.
Psalms 84:12 One day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere: I have chosen to be cast out in the house of my God rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners.
Psalms 84:13 For God loves mercy and truth; he will give grace and glory.
Psalms 84:14 He will not withhold good things from those who walk in innocence: O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in you.

Psalms 85:3 You have calmed all Your wrath; You have turned away from the heat of Your anger.
Psalms 85:4 Turn to us again, O God of our salvation, and turn away Your anger from us.
Psalms 85:5 Will You be angry with us forever? Will You extend Your anger from one generation to another?
Psalms 85:6 Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?
Psalms 85:7 Show us Your mercy, O Lord, and grant us Your salvation.
Psalms 85:8 I will listen to what God the Lord says, for He will speak peace to His people, and to His saints, and to those who turn their hearts to Him.

Psalms 86:13 For your mercy to me is great, and you have rescued my soul from the depths of hell.

Psalms 86:16 Turn to me and have mercy on me; give your strength to your servant, and save the son of your maidservant.

Psalms 88:3 For my soul is filled with evils: and my life has approached to the abyss.
Psalms 88:4 I am counted among those who go down into the pit: I have become like a man without help,
Psalms 88:5 free among the dead: like the wounded sleeping in the sepulchres, of whom you are no longer mindful: and they have been cast off from your hand.
Psalms 88:6 They have laid me in the lowest pit: in darkness, and in the shadow of death.
Psalms 88:7 Your wrath has been confirmed over me: and you have brought all your waves over me.
Psalms 88:8 You have distanced my acquaintances from me: they have made me an abomination to themselves.
Psalms 88:9 I have been delivered, and I could not go out: my eyes languished for want.
Psalms 88:10 I have cried to you, O Lord, all day: I have extended my hands to you.
Psalms 88:11 Will you work wonders for the dead? or will the doctors raise them up, and confess to you?
Psalms 88:12 Will anyone declare your mercy in the sepulchre, and your truth in perdition?
Psalms 88:13 Will your wonders be known in the dark, and your justice in the land of oblivion?
Psalms 88:14 And I, O Lord, have cried to you: and in the morning my prayer will come before you.
Psalms 88:15 Why, O Lord, do you cast off my soul: you turn your face away from me?
Psalms 88:16 I am poor, and in labors from my youth: but being exalted, I was humbled and disturbed.
Psalms 88:17 Your wrath has passed over me: and your terrors have troubled me.
Psalms 88:18 They have surrounded me like water all day: they have surrounded me together.
Psalms 88:19 You have removed from me friend and neighbor: and my acquaintances because of misery.
Psalms 89:1 O Lord, you've been my only love from all of eternity; and I will not be parted from you.
Psalms 89:2 My flesh is now decaying, and my heart is failing: but God is the strength of my heart, and God will be my portion for all eternity.
Psalms 89:3 For see, those who try to separate themselves from you will be lost: you will destroy everyone who abandons you.

Psalms 89:13 Show us your mercy, O Lord; and grant us your salvation.

Psalms 89:19 Justice will walk before him; and he will set his footsteps in the way.
Psalms 90:1 Lord, you have been our refuge from one generation to the next.
Psalms 90:2 Even before the mountains were made, before the earth and all the universe were formed, you have always existed, and you will always exist.
Psalms 90:3 You turn men back to dust and say: “Return, sons of men!”
Psalms 90:4 Because a thousand years in your sight are like the passing of yesterday, like a fleeting moment in the night.
Psalms 90:5 You sweep people away in death; their lives are a mere moment. They’re like grass that quickly withers,
Psalms 90:6 that flourishes in the morning, but by evening it is cut down, withered, and dried up.
Psalms 90:7 We are consumed by your anger; we are terrified by your wrath.
Psalms 90:8 You have placed our sins before you, our secret sins under the light of your presence.
Psalms 90:9 All of our days pass under your wrath; we are consumed in a moment.
Psalms 90:10 The years of our lives pass like a spider’s web. The span of our lives is seventy years,
Psalms 90:11 or perhaps, if we are strong, eighty years; even then, their lives are spent mostly in toil and sorrow.
Psalms 90:12 They quickly pass away; we fade.
Psalms 90:13 Who knows the power of your anger? Who understands the full extent of your wrath?
Psalms 90:14 Teach us to number our days so that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
Psalms 90:15 Return, O Lord! How long will you delay? Have pity on your servants.
Psalms 90:16 Satisfy us each morning with your love so that we may be filled with joy for all our days.
Psalms 90:17 Make us rejoice for as long as you have afflicted us, for the years when we saw suffering.
Psalms 90:18 Show your servants your work, and show your glory to their children.
Psalms 90:19 May the Lord, our God, show us his favor. Make all that we do succeed. Yes, make it all succeed.
Psalms 91:1 If you dwell and rest in the help of the Highest God, then you will also dwell in the protection of the sky.
Psalms 91:2 You will say to God the Father: "You are my protector and my refuge: my God, in You I will hope."
Psalms 91:3 Because He freed me from the snare of the hunters and from a harsh word.
Psalms 91:4 With His wings He will overshadow you and protect you, and under His protection you will hope:
Psalms 91:5 His truth and love is a shield and a protection.
Psalms 91:6 You will not fear the fear of the darkness of night, nor will you be frightened by the arrow of sin that flies in the day,
Psalms 91:7 nor of the plague that travels in darkness, nor of the destruction and the devil of the midday sun.
Psalms 91:8 Though a thousand men may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand:
Psalms 91:9 it will not come near you.
Psalms 91:10 But your eyes will see what the true nature of things are, and you will see the punishment of sinners.
Psalms 91:11 Because you are, O Lord, my hope:
Psalms 91:12 You have made God the Highest, your refuge.
Psalms 91:13 Evil shall not come to you, and the scourge of sin will not come near your dwelling.
Psalms 91:14 For He has given His angels the command to guard you in all your ways.
Psalms 91:15 They will carry you in their hands, so you will not strike your foot against a stone.
Psalms 91:16 You will walk over the asp and the basilisk: and you will trample on the lion and the dragon.
Psalms 91:17 “Because he has hoped in Me, I will free him, and I will protect him, because he knows My Name.

Proverbs 1:1 These are the proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:
Proverbs 1:2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline;
Proverbs 1:3 To help you understand the words of the wise;
Proverbs 1:4 To help you receive training in doctrine, justice, judgment, and equity;
Proverbs 1:5 So that children may be prudent, and the young may have knowledge and understanding.
Proverbs 1:6 The wise will listen, and become wiser; and those who understand will guide themselves well.
Proverbs 1:7 The fear of God is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and doctrine.
Proverbs 1:8 Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and don't abandon the law of your mother:
Proverbs 1:9 For these teachings will be a graceful ornament for your head, and a chain for your neck.
Proverbs 1:10 My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
Proverbs 1:11 If they say, “Come with us, let us lay in wait for blood, let us hide snares against the innocent without cause:
Proverbs 1:12 Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and the just as if he were going down into a pit:
Proverbs 1:13 We shall find all precious substance, we will fill our houses with spoils:
Proverbs 1:14 Cast in your lot among us, and let us all have one purse:
Proverbs 1:15 My son, do not walk with them, restrain your foot from their paths:
Proverbs 1:16 For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.
Proverbs 1:17 But in vain the net is spread before the eyes of those who have wings.
Proverbs 1:18 For they lie in wait against their own blood, and practice deceits against their own souls.
Proverbs 1:19 So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain: they take away the souls of their possessors.
Proverbs 1:20 Wisdom cries out in the streets, she utters her voice in the squares:
Proverbs 1:21 At the head of crowds she cries out, in the entrance of the gates she speaks:
Proverbs 1:22 How long, O little ones, will you love childhood, and you fools desire what is hurtful to you?
Proverbs 1:23 Turn to my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, and I will show you my words.
Proverbs 1:24 Because I have called, and you refused: I have stretched out my hand, and there was no one who would listen:
Proverbs 1:25 But you have treated all my counsel as nothing, and have neglected my reproofs:
Proverbs 1:26 I also will laugh at your destruction: and I will mock when what you feared comes upon you,
Proverbs 1:27 When sudden calamity falls upon you, and destruction comes like a storm: when tribulation and anguish come upon you.
Proverbs 1:28 Then they will call upon me, and I will not hear: they will rise early in the morning, and they will not find me:
Proverbs 1:29 Because they have despised knowledge, and have not chosen the fear of God:
Proverbs 1:30 Nor have they willed my counsel, and have scorned my reproofs:
Proverbs 1:31 Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and they shall be filled with their own devices.
Proverbs 1:32 The turning away of the little ones will kill them, and the prosperity of fools will deceive them.
Proverbs 1:33 But whoever believes in me, shall rest in hope, and shall abound with the fear of God.
Proverbs 2:1 My son, if you receive my words and treasure my precepts,
Proverbs 2:2 Then you will train your heart to understand, and turn your ear to wisdom.
Proverbs 2:3 Yes, if you ask to understand, and if you direct your heart to discern wisdom—
Proverbs 2:4 If you seek her like silver, and search for her like a treasure—
Proverbs 2:5 Then you will understand the fear of the Lord, and you will find the knowledge of God.
Proverbs 2:6 For the Lord gives wisdom, and from His mouth comes understanding and insight.
Proverbs 2:7 He treasures the honest. He protects the way of those who live blamelessly,
Proverbs 2:8 preserving the paths of justice, and safeguarding the ways of the saints.
Proverbs 2:9 Then you will understand justice and judgment and fairness, and every good path.
Proverbs 2:10 If wisdom enters your heart, and knowledge delights your soul,
Proverbs 2:11 Then counsel will protect you, and prudence will preserve you:
Proverbs 2:12 to rescue you from the evil way, and from the man who speaks perverse things:
Proverbs 2:13 those who abandon the straight path, and walk the dark paths:
Proverbs 2:14 who rejoice when they do evil, and exult in the worst things:
Proverbs 2:15 whose paths are crooked, and whose steps are twisted.
Proverbs 2:16 And to deliver you from a strange woman, and from the foreigner who makes her words sweet:
Proverbs 2:17 who abandons the husband of her youth and has forgotten the covenant of her God.
Proverbs 2:18 For her house is near death, and her paths lead to the underworld.
Proverbs 2:19 All who enter her do not return, and do not sustain the right paths.
Proverbs 2:20 So that a just man walks in his integrity: his steps are clear for one who walks the right way.
Proverbs 2:21 For the upright shall inhabit the land, and the perfect will remain in it.
Proverbs 2:22 But the wicked will be cut off from the earth: and those who deal unjustly will be removed from it.
Proverbs 3:1 My son, don't forget my teachings, and let your heart guard my commandments.
Proverbs 3:2 They will add to you long life, many years, and peace.

Proverbs 3:8 This will be health for your navel, and nourishment for your bones.
Proverbs 3:9 Honor the Lord with your possessions, and give Him the first fruits of your crops.
Proverbs 3:10 Then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will overflow with wine.
Proverbs 3:11 My son, do not reject the Lord’s discipline, nor be disgusted when you are corrected by Him:
Proverbs 3:12 because the Lord corrects the one He loves, as a father corrects the son in whom he delights.
Proverbs 3:13 Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who overflows with understanding:
Proverbs 3:14 For her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her revenue is better than fine gold.
Proverbs 3:15 She is more precious than all gems, and nothing you desire can compare to her.
Proverbs 3:16 Long life is in her right hand, and in her left hand are riches and honor.
Proverbs 3:17 Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.
Proverbs 3:18 She is a tree of life to those who grasp her, and happy is the one who holds her fast.
Proverbs 3:19 The Lord by wisdom founded the earth, and by understanding He established the heavens.
Proverbs 3:20 By His knowledge the depths were broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
Proverbs 3:21 My son, let these things not depart from your sight: keep sound wisdom and discretion.
Proverbs 3:22 So they will be life for your soul and grace for your neck.
Proverbs 3:23 Then you will go your way confidently, and your foot will not stumble.
Proverbs 3:24 If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you sleep, your sleep will be sweet.
Proverbs 3:25 Do not be afraid of sudden fear, nor of the ruin of the wicked when it comes.
Proverbs 3:26 For the Lord will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being caught.
Proverbs 3:27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.
Proverbs 3:28 Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come back, and tomorrow I will give it,” when you have it with you.
Proverbs 3:29 Do not plan evil against your neighbor, when he trusts in you.
Proverbs 3:30 Do not quarrel with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.
Proverbs 3:31 Do not envy the man of violence, nor choose any of his ways:
Proverbs 3:32 because the perverse man is an abomination to the Lord, but He is intimate with the upright.
Proverbs 3:33 The Lord’s curse is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the dwelling of the just.
Proverbs 3:34 Truly, He mocks at the scornful, but gives grace to the humble.
Proverbs 3:35 The wise will inherit glory, but fools will receive disgrace.
Proverbs 4:1 Listen, sons, to the teachings of your father, and pay attention so you may understand wisdom.
Proverbs 4:2 I will give you good teaching: don't abandon my law.
Proverbs 4:3 I was a son of my father, gentle and beloved in the eyes of my mother.
Proverbs 4:4 And he taught me, and said to me: “Keep my words in your heart, guard my precepts, and live by them.”
Proverbs 4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding: don't forget, and don't turn away from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs 4:6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you; love her, and she will protect you.
Proverbs 4:7 The beginning of wisdom is, get wisdom, and with all your possessions, acquire understanding.
Proverbs 4:8 Embrace her, and she will exalt you; you will be glorified by her, when you have embraced her.
Proverbs 4:9 She will give your head the grace of growth, and she will crown you with glory.
Proverbs 4:10 Listen, my son, and accept my words, and the years of your life will multiply for you.
Proverbs 4:11 I will show you the path of wisdom, and I will lead you in the footsteps of righteousness:
Proverbs 4:12 when you enter it, your steps will not be constricted; and when you run, you will not have sadness.
Proverbs 4:13 Take discipline, do not abandon it; guard it, because it is your life.
Proverbs 4:14 Don't enter the path of the wicked, nor tread the way of sinners.
Proverbs 4:15 Avoid it, and do not pass through it; turn away, and depart from it.
Proverbs 4:16 For they do not sleep unless they have done evil: and their sleep is taken away unless they have tripped someone.
Proverbs 4:17 For they eat the bread of ungodliness, and they drink the wine of iniquity.
Proverbs 4:18 But the path of the just is like light traveling through space, and it will be made just until the perfect day.
Proverbs 4:19 The way of the wicked is dark: they do not know where they fall.
Proverbs 4:20 My son, pay attention to my words: and incline your ear to my sayings.
Proverbs 4:21 Let them not depart from your eyes: guard them in the middle of your heart.
Proverbs 4:22 For they are life to those who find them: and health to all flesh.

Proverbs 4:26 Direct your steps, and make all your ways firm.
Proverbs 4:27 Do not turn to the right or to the left: turn your foot away from evil.
Proverbs 5:1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Give ear to my understanding.
Proverbs 5:2 Keep discretion, and your lips will guard knowledge.
Proverbs 5:3 Don't long for a woman who isn't your wife, and don't wander around her house.
Proverbs 5:4 For the lips of a harlot are like a dripping honeycomb, and her throat is smoother than oil.
Proverbs 5:5 But in the end, she is as bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.
Proverbs 5:6 Her feet go down to death, and her steps lead straight to the grave.
Proverbs 5:7 She doesn't walk the paths of life. Her steps are always wandering, and you can't predict where she will go.
Proverbs 5:8 Now, my son, listen to me and don't turn away from the words I am saying.
Proverbs 5:9 Keep your way far from her, and don't go near the door of her house.
Proverbs 5:10 Lest you should give your honor to others, and your years to those who are cruel.
Proverbs 5:11 Lest strangers be filled with your strength, and your labors in the house of someone else,
Proverbs 5:12 And in the end you will regret it, when you've ruined your flesh and your body, and say:
Proverbs 5:13 “How I hated discipline, and my heart scorned rebuke!
Proverbs 5:14 I didn’t listen to the voice of those who taught me, nor did I pay attention to those who gave me instruction.
Proverbs 5:15 I almost fell into every kind of evil in the middle of the Church and the synagogues.
Proverbs 5:16 Drink water from your own cistern, and from the springs of your well.
Proverbs 5:17 Let your springs be poured out outside, but divide your waters into the streets.
Proverbs 5:18 Let them be yours alone, and not those of strangers with you.
Proverbs 5:19 Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth.
Proverbs 5:20 A most beautiful hind, and a graceful deer. Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; always delight in her love.
Proverbs 5:21 Why, my son, should you be ruined with a woman who isn’t your wife, and be embraced in the bosom of another?
Proverbs 5:22 The works of a man are in the sight of the Lord, and He considers his ways.
Proverbs 5:23 The wicked are caught in their own sins, and are held fast in the chains of their own offenses.
Proverbs 6:1 My son, if you have agreed to be surety for your neighbor, and have pledged your word for another,
Proverbs 6:2 you are ensnared by the words of your mouth, and taken captive by the words of your lips,
Proverbs 6:3 do what I say, my son, and deliver yourself; because you have fallen into the hands of your neighbor: hasten and withdraw.
Proverbs 6:4 Give not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.
Proverbs 6:5 Be delivered as a roe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Proverbs 6:6 Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom.
Proverbs 6:7 Which although she has no guide, nor master, nor lord,
Proverbs 6:8 provides her food in the summer, and gathers in the harvest what she may eat.
Proverbs 6:9 How long, you sluggard, will you sleep? When will you arise from your sleep?
Proverbs 6:10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest:
Proverbs 6:11 and your poverty shall come as a traveler, and your want as an armed man.
Proverbs 6:12 A wicked man, a man without law, walks with a perverse mouth.
Proverbs 6:13 Who winks with his eyes, and presses with his feet, and speaks with his finger.
Proverbs 6:14 Perversities are in his heart, he devises evil at all times, and sows discord.
Proverbs 6:15 Therefore his destruction shall come suddenly; he shall be broken suddenly, and shall no longer have a remedy.
Proverbs 6:16 These six things the Lord hates, and the seventh his soul hates:
Proverbs 6:17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
Proverbs 6:18 a heart that devises wicked plots, feet swift to run into evil,
Proverbs 6:19 a false witness that utters lies, and he that sows discord among brothers.
Proverbs 6:20 Keep, my son, the precepts of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother:
Proverbs 6:21 Bind them continually in your heart, and put them around your neck.
Proverbs 6:22 When you walk, let them go with you; when you sleep, let them keep you; and when you wake, speak with them.
Proverbs 6:23 Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and the way of life is the reproof of discipline:
Proverbs 6:24 That you may keep yourself from the evil woman, and from the flattery of the tongue of the stranger.
Proverbs 6:25 Desire not her beauty in your heart, neither be caught with her eyelids.
Proverbs 6:26 For a harlot's sustenance is to the morsel of bread: and the strange woman hunts for the precious soul.
Proverbs 6:27 Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not be burned?
Proverbs 6:28 Or who can walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
Proverbs 6:29 So is he that goes in to his neighbor's wife; he shall not be clean that touches her.
Proverbs 6:30 It is no fault in him that steals when he is hungry, that he may fill his soul.
Proverbs 6:31 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give all the substance of his house.
Proverbs 6:32 He that commits adultery is foolish: but he that would destroy his own soul does it.
Proverbs 6:33 He gathers to himself disgrace and infamy, and his shame shall not be blotted out.
Proverbs 6:34 For the jealousy of a husband provokes wrath: nor will he spare in the day of revenge.
Proverbs 6:35 Nor will he accept any man's prayers, nor will he be appeased by any amount of compensation.
Proverbs 7:1 My son, always remember and guard what I teach you. Always keep in your heart the wisdom I give you.
Proverbs 7:2 Keep my commands, and you will live. Treasure my law like the pupil of your eye.
Proverbs 7:3 Tie my wisdom to your fingers to remind you. Write it on the tablets of your heart.
Proverbs 7:4 Say to wisdom: “You are my sister.” Call prudence your closest friend:
Proverbs 7:5 So that they will guard you against a strange woman. Against the one who flatters with her words.
Proverbs 7:6 Once I looked out the window of my house. I peered through the lattice,
Proverbs 7:7 And I saw some naive young men. I noticed a young man with no common sense among them.
Proverbs 7:8 He was going down the street near her corner. He was walking near the door of her house,
Proverbs 7:9 in the twilight, as it was getting dark, in the middle of the night,
Proverbs 7:10 Suddenly, a woman came to meet him. She was dressed like a prostitute, ready to deceive the hearts of fools.
Proverbs 7:11 She was loud and defiant. Her feet never stayed in one place.
Proverbs 7:12 She was now in the streets, now in the squares, now near every corner, lurking near the road.
Proverbs 7:13 She grabbed him and kissed him. She then said to him with a brazen face:
Proverbs 7:14 “I had to offer sacrifices for my safety. Today, I have paid my vows.
Proverbs 7:15 So I came out to meet you. I wanted you, and I found you!
Proverbs 7:16 I have spread my bed with tapestries, with fine linens from Egypt.
Proverbs 7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Proverbs 7:18 Come, let's drink our fill of love, and enjoy each other's company until morning. My husband isn’t home,
Proverbs 7:19 He has gone on a long journey.
Proverbs 7:20 He took a bag of money with him. He will return home on the appointed day.”
Proverbs 7:21 With her seductive words, she persuaded him. She enticed him with her flattering lips.
Proverbs 7:22 Immediately he followed her like an ox to the slaughter, like a fool going to be punished, not knowing that he was going to be punished,
Proverbs 7:23 until an arrow pierces his liver. Like a bird darting into a snare, unaware that it’s a matter of life and death.
Proverbs 7:24 Now, my son, listen to me and pay attention to the words of my mouth.
Proverbs 7:25 Do not let your heart turn to her ways, and do not stray on her paths.
Proverbs 7:26 Because she has caused many to be wounded and killed. She has killed many of the strongest men.
Proverbs 7:27 Her house is the way to the grave; it descends to the chambers of death.
Proverbs 8:1 Doesn't wisdom cry out? Doesn't careful thought raise its voice?
Proverbs 8:2 Wisdom stands in the highest places, in the middle of the public roads,
Proverbs 8:3 near the city gates, and it is the first thing people hear.
Proverbs 8:4 “I call out to you, men. My voice is for all people.
Proverbs 8:5 You who are foolish, learn common sense. You who are simple, apply your minds.
Proverbs 8:6 Listen, because I will speak of great things. I will open my lips to say what is right.
Proverbs 8:7 My mouth will proclaim truth. My lips hate wicked speech.
Proverbs 8:8 All my words are just. There is nothing twisted or wrong in them.
Proverbs 8:9 Everything is clear to those who understand, and truth will come to those who know.
Proverbs 8:10 Accept my instruction, not money; and knowledge more than the purest gold.
Proverbs 8:11 For wisdom is better than jewels, and nothing desired is comparable to it.
Proverbs 8:12 “I, Wisdom, dwell in counsel. I am present in thoughtful consideration.
Proverbs 8:13 To fear the Lord is to hate evil. I hate pride, arrogance, a bad path, and a deceitful mouth.
Proverbs 8:14 I have counsel and righteousness. I have prudence, I have strength.
Proverbs 8:15 By me, kings reign, and rulers decree what is just.

Proverbs 8:17 I love those who love me. Those who seek me early will find me.
Proverbs 8:18 Riches and glory are with me, as are wealth and righteousness.
Proverbs 8:19 My fruit is better than gold and precious stones; and my produce is better than refined silver.
Proverbs 8:20 I walk in the way of righteousness, in the middle of the paths of judgment.
Proverbs 8:21 So that I may enrich those who love me and fill their treasuries.
Proverbs 8:22 The Lord created me at the beginning of His ways, before He made anything else.
Proverbs 8:23 From eternity, I was ordained, from the beginning, before the earth was made.
Proverbs 8:24 Before there were deep seas, I was already conceived; before the springs of water flowed forth:
Proverbs 8:25 Before the mountains were formed, I was born before the hills.
Proverbs 8:26 Before He had made the land, the rivers, and the foundations of the earth, I was there.
Proverbs 8:27 When He prepared the universe, I was there; when He established the sky above the oceans,
Proverbs 8:28 when He strengthened the clouds above, and secured the fountains of the deep,
Proverbs 8:29 when He established the sea's boundaries, and a law so the water wouldn't cross them, and when He laid the foundations of the earth,
Proverbs 8:30 then I was with Him, arranging everything. And I rejoiced daily, playing before Him all the time,
Proverbs 8:31 playing in the world; and my delight was to be with the children of men.
Proverbs 8:32 So now, children, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways.
Proverbs 8:33 Listen to instruction and be wise; do not cast it away.
Proverbs 8:34 Blessed is the man who hears me, and who watches at my doors every day, and observes the posts of my doors.
Proverbs 8:35 Whoever finds me finds life and will receive salvation from the Lord.
Proverbs 8:36 But whoever sins against me harms his own soul. All who hate me love death.
Proverbs 9:1 Wisdom has built herself a house; she has carved out seven columns.
Proverbs 9:2 She has prepared her sacrifices, mixed her wine, and set up her table.
Proverbs 9:3 She sent her servants to call out from the highest points and the walls of the city:
Proverbs 9:4 "Whoever is young, let him come to me," and she spoke to those who lacked understanding:

Proverbs 9:16 "Whoever is young, let him come to me;" and she spoke to the foolish:
Proverbs 9:17 “Stolen water is sweeter, and hidden bread is more pleasant."
Proverbs 9:18 But she does not know that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell.

Proverbs 31:18 She sees that her work is good: her lamp is not extinguished at night.
Proverbs 31:19 She puts her hand to strong tasks, and her palms have confirmed the threads.
Proverbs 31:20 She opens her hand to the poor, and extends her palms to the needy.
Proverbs 31:21 She will not fear for her household because of the snow: for all her household are clothed in double garments.
Proverbs 31:22 She makes coverings for herself, and her clothing is fine linen and purple.
Proverbs 31:23 Her husband is known at the gates, when he sits with the elders of the land.
Proverbs 31:24 She makes linen and sells it, and gives a girdle to the merchant.
Proverbs 31:25 Strength and beauty are her clothing: and she will laugh in the last day.
Proverbs 31:26 She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the law of kindness is on her tongue.
Proverbs 31:27 She considers the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness.
Proverbs 31:28 Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her.
Proverbs 31:29 Many daughters have gathered riches: but you surpass them all.
Proverbs 31:30 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman who fears God will be praised.
Proverbs 31:31 Give her of the fruit of her hands: and let her works praise her in the gates.
Ecclesiastes 1:1 These are the words of the Preacher, the son of David, the king of Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes 1:2 “Meaningless, meaningless,” says the Preacher; “all things are meaningless.”
Ecclesiastes 1:3 What is the benefit to any person for all his labor—labor that he does under the sun?
Ecclesiastes 1:4 One generation passes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains the same throughout time.
Ecclesiastes 1:5 The sun rises and sets, returning to its place, and then, rising again,
Ecclesiastes 1:6 it travels south, then turns north, always circling, always going back to its own circuits.
Ecclesiastes 1:7 All rivers run into the sea, yet the sea does not become full. The rivers flow where they came from, so they can continue to flow.
Ecclesiastes 1:8 All things are hard; no person can explain them with words.
Ecclesiastes 1:9 The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear filled with hearing.
Ecclesiastes 1:10 What has happened already? The same things that are going to happen again. What has been done before? The same things that will have to be done again. There is nothing new under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 1:11 If someone says, “Look, this is new!” it has already happened long ago in the ages before us.
Ecclesiastes 1:12 There is no memory of what came before. Nor will those who come after remember what the first ones did, even in the very last generation.
Ecclesiastes 1:13 I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes 1:14 And I set my heart to seek and examine wisely all the things that are done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 1:15 God gave this bad occupation to the sons of men, so that they should be occupied with it.
Ecclesiastes 1:16 I saw all the things that are done under the sun, and behold, all things are meaningless and a chasing after wind.
Ecclesiastes 1:17 What is crooked cannot be made straight, and the number of fools is infinite.
Ecclesiastes 1:18 I said in my heart, “I have become great, and I have increased in wisdom more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.” And my mind has contemplated much wisdom and knowledge.
Ecclesiastes 1:19 I set my heart to know prudence, and also foolishness and folly: and I knew that this too was a chasing after wind,
Ecclesiastes 1:20 because in much wisdom there is much anger, and he who increases knowledge, increases sorrow.
Ecclesiastes 2:1 I told myself: “I will go and experience pleasure, and enjoy good things.” And I saw that this, too, was futility.
Ecclesiastes 2:2 I said of laughter: “It is madness!” and I said of joy: “What use is this?”
Ecclesiastes 2:3 I pondered in my heart the way to cheer my body with wine, and how to sustain my mind with wisdom. I wanted to see what I should do under heaven during the few days of my life. I wanted to see what was good for humanity. I saw that this, too, was futility.
Ecclesiastes 2:4 I did great things: I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.
Ecclesiastes 2:5 I made gardens and parks, and planted every kind of fruit tree in them.
Ecclesiastes 2:6 I created pools of water to irrigate the groves of young trees.
Ecclesiastes 2:7 I had many servants and maids, and more possessions than anyone before me in Jerusalem.
Ecclesiastes 2:8 I gathered for myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I provided for myself singers and musicians, and the delights of the sons of men: many of them.
Ecclesiastes 2:9 So I became great, more so than anyone before me in Jerusalem. I always kept my wisdom.
Ecclesiastes 2:10 And I did not deny my eyes anything they desired. I refused to restrain my heart from any pleasure. I was glad in all my labor. This was my reward.
Ecclesiastes 2:11 I turned to consider all the works that my hands had accomplished, and the labor which I had toiled at. And behold, all was vanity and affliction of mind, and no profit under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 2:12 I then turned to consider wisdom, and madness, and folly. For what can a man do who comes after the king? What has he done already?
Ecclesiastes 2:13 I saw that wisdom is better than folly, as light is better than darkness.
Ecclesiastes 2:14 The wise man has eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. But I understood that one fate comes to both of them.
Ecclesiastes 2:15 Then I said in my heart, “As the fool is, so am I.” Why then have I been so very wise? I then realized this was also futility.
Ecclesiastes 2:16 There is no permanent memory of the wise, and no lasting memory of the fool. In the coming days, all will be forgotten.
Ecclesiastes 2:17 So I hated life, because all things done under the sun were grievous to me. For everything is vanity and an affliction of mind.
Ecclesiastes 2:18 I hated all the fruit of my labor, which I had gained under the sun. I must leave it for the man who comes after me.
Ecclesiastes 2:19 Who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? Yet he will have control over all my labor in which I have toiled under the sun. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 2:20 So I began to despair of all my labor at which I had toiled under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 2:21 For there is a man who has labored with wisdom, and knowledge, and skill, but who must then give his portion to a man who did not labor for it. This also is vanity and great evil.
Ecclesiastes 2:22 For what does a man get from all his labor and toil at which he toils under the sun?
Ecclesiastes 2:23 For all his days are full of grief, and his task is a source of sorrow. Even at night, his heart is not at rest. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 2:24 There is no good for a man but to eat, drink, and allow his soul to be happy in his labor. Then I saw that this also is from the hand of God.
Ecclesiastes 2:25 Who indeed can eat, or who can rejoice, without Him?
Ecclesiastes 2:26 To the man who pleases Him, God gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy. But to the sinner, God gives the task of gathering and collecting so that it can then be given to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and an affliction of the mind.
Ecclesiastes 3:1 Everything happens at the right time, in its season, and there is a specific time for everything that happens under the sky.
Ecclesiastes 3:2 There is a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot what has been planted.
Ecclesiastes 3:3 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to destroy, and a time to build up.
Ecclesiastes 3:4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.
Ecclesiastes 3:5 A time to scatter stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.
Ecclesiastes 3:6 A time to gain, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away.
Ecclesiastes 3:7 A time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak.
Ecclesiastes 3:8 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
Ecclesiastes 3:9 What does the worker gain from his toil?
Ecclesiastes 3:10 I have seen the burden that God has given the children of men to be afflicted in it.
Ecclesiastes 3:11 He has made everything beautiful in its time, and He has put eternity into their hearts, so that no man can find out the work that God has done from the beginning to the end.
Ecclesiastes 3:12 I have known that there is no better thing for them than to rejoice, and to do good in their life.
Ecclesiastes 3:13 Also, that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor—this is the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes 3:14 I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. And this God does, so that men should fear Him.
Ecclesiastes 3:15 That which has been is already, and that which is to be has already been. And God restores what has passed.
Ecclesiastes 3:16 And moreover, I have seen under the sun the place of judgment, where wickedness was, and the place of righteousness, where wickedness was.
Ecclesiastes 3:17 And I said in my heart, “God will judge both the righteous and the wicked.” For there is a time for every matter, and for every work.
Ecclesiastes 3:18 I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God would test them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
Ecclesiastes 3:19 For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same: As one dies, so dies the other; and all have the same breath. Man has no advantage over the beast, for all is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 3:20 All go to one place; all came from the dust, and all return to the dust.
Ecclesiastes 3:21 Who knows whether the spirit of the sons of men ascends upward, and the spirit of the beasts descends downward to the earth?
Ecclesiastes 3:22 So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion. For who shall bring him back to see what will be after him?
Ecclesiastes 4:1 I then returned and saw all the oppression going on in the world. I observed the tears of the innocent, and there was no one to comfort them. They were being violently attacked by those in power, but there was no one to help them.
Ecclesiastes 4:2 I consider those who have died to be more blessed than those who are still alive.
Ecclesiastes 4:3 I even felt that it would be better not to have been born at all, so that one wouldn't see the evil that goes on in the world.
Ecclesiastes 4:4 I noticed that all the hard work done by humans is fueled by envy of others.
Ecclesiastes 4:5 This is vanity, a chasing after the wind, as the envious person tries to satisfy his own greed.
Ecclesiastes 4:6 It is better to be satisfied with one handful of possessions than two handfuls, if you are working to gain those things with anxieties of the spirit.
Ecclesiastes 4:7 This, too, is vanity and a striving after the wind.
Ecclesiastes 4:8 There is also the case of the solitary man, who has no companion, no son or brother, and yet his work never ends, and his eyes are never satisfied with riches. He never thinks, "For whom am I working, and depriving myself of pleasure?"
Ecclesiastes 4:9 This, too, is vanity, and a miserable business.
Ecclesiastes 4:10 Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.
Ecclesiastes 4:11 If either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But pity the person who falls and has no one to help him up.
Ecclesiastes 4:12 Also, if two lie down, they will keep each other warm. But how can one person be warm alone?
Ecclesiastes 4:13 Though one is overpowered, two can defend themselves. A three-ply cord is not easily broken.
Ecclesiastes 4:14 Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to heed warnings.
Ecclesiastes 4:15 For even when the king was formerly imprisoned, he could come to power, and then another poor person could be born into the kingdom.
Ecclesiastes 4:16 I considered all the living who are walking under the sun, and I was struck by the fact that the next young man will soon take over the kingdom.
Ecclesiastes 4:17 There is no end to all those who preceded him, and those who come after will not rejoice in him. This, too, is vanity and striving after the wind.
Ecclesiastes 5:1 Be careful when you go to the house of God. Give more heed to the Word of God than to the words of foolish men, lest you make a sacrifice to the folly of men.
Ecclesiastes 5:2 Don’t speak rashly. Don’t let your heart be too quick to utter a word before God. God is in the universe, and you are upon the earth, so let your words be few.
Ecclesiastes 5:3 For sleep comes with many activities, and the fool is recognized in much speech.
Ecclesiastes 5:4 When you vow a vow to God, don’t delay to pay it, for God hates a foolish and unreliable promise. Whatever you vow, pay it.
Ecclesiastes 5:5 It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.
Ecclesiastes 5:6 Don’t let your mouth cause you to sin, and don’t say before an angel, “It was a mistake.” Don't let God, angry at your words, destroy the works of your hands.
Ecclesiastes 5:7 When there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and many words. But you, fear God.
Ecclesiastes 5:8 If you see the poor oppressed and justice and righteousness violently taken away in a judgment, don’t be surprised at this situation, because the highest is greater than the others, and there are higher ones than them, and still others higher than those.
Ecclesiastes 5:9 Moreover, the advantage of the land is for all. Even a king depends on the harvest.
Ecclesiastes 5:10 The one who loves money will not be satisfied with money. Whoever loves riches will get no fruit from them, and this too is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 5:11 When goods increase, so do those who consume them. So what advantage is there to the possessor except to see them with his eyes?
Ecclesiastes 5:12 Sweet is the sleep of the worker, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich does not allow him to sleep.
Ecclesiastes 5:13 There is also another most grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches preserved for the harm of their owners.
Ecclesiastes 5:14 For riches are destroyed in evil circumstances, and when they beget a son, he comes to nothing.
Ecclesiastes 5:15 As he came naked from his mother’s womb, so will he return naked, and will take nothing for his labor that he can carry in his hand.
Ecclesiastes 5:16 This is also a most grievous evil: that he departs in the same way that he came. What advantage then is it to him that he has labored for the wind?
Ecclesiastes 5:17 All his days he eats in darkness, with much sorrow, and indignation, and grief.
Ecclesiastes 5:18 Behold, what I have seen to be good and beautiful is to eat and drink and enjoy the good of one’s labor under the sun during the number of days of his life that God has given him, for this is his portion.
Ecclesiastes 5:19 For everyone to whom God gives riches and possessions and grants the power to eat of them, to receive his portion, and to rejoice in his labor, this is a gift of God.
Ecclesiastes 5:20 For he will not often remember the days of his life, because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.
Ecclesiastes 6:1 Here's another problem I see happening among mankind:
Ecclesiastes 6:2 A man to whom God gives wealth, property, and honor, and who lacks nothing of all he desires, but God doesn't let him enjoy any of it. Instead, a stranger consumes it. This is vanity and great suffering.
Ecclesiastes 6:3 If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, and accumulates many days of life, but his soul is not satisfied with good things, and he gets no proper burial, then I declare that an infant who died before birth is better off than he is.
Ecclesiastes 6:4 The stillborn comes in vain, and goes into darkness, and his name is covered in shadows.
Ecclesiastes 6:5 He never saw the sun, nor knew the difference between good and evil.
Ecclesiastes 6:6 Even if he lived two thousand years, yet did not enjoy good things, wouldn't everything be heading to the same place?
Ecclesiastes 6:7 All human labor is for his mouth, but his soul is never filled.
Ecclesiastes 6:8 So, what does the wise man have more than the fool? And what does the poor man gain by living?
Ecclesiastes 6:9 It is better to enjoy what you see than to give in to desire. But this too is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 6:10 Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known that man cannot fight against what is stronger than he is.
Ecclesiastes 6:11 There are many things that multiply vanity; what does man have more than vanity?
Ecclesiastes 6:12 For who knows what is good for man during his lifetime of vanity, which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun?
Ecclesiastes 7:1 A good reputation is better than expensive perfume, and the day of death is better than the day of birth.
Ecclesiastes 7:2 It is better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting: because there we can contemplate the end of all things, and the living can remember what is to come.
Ecclesiastes 7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter, because through sorrow, the mind can be corrected.
Ecclesiastes 7:4 The wise have sorrow in their heart, but the fools have only the foolishness of laughter.
Ecclesiastes 7:5 It is better to listen to the rebuke of the wise than to the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes 7:6 For as the sound of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool: and this also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 7:7 Oppression makes the wise man foolish, and it destroys the strength of his heart.
Ecclesiastes 7:8 The end of a matter is better than its beginning. It is better to be patient than to be proud.
Ecclesiastes 7:9 Do not be quick to anger, for anger rests in the bosom of a fool.
Ecclesiastes 7:10 Do not say: “Why do you think that the life of the past was better than this?” because that is a foolish question.
Ecclesiastes 7:11 Wisdom is good with riches, and those who live under the light find benefit.
Ecclesiastes 7:12 For under the shadow of wisdom and under the shadow of wealth, there is protection: but the knowledge of wisdom protects its owner.
Ecclesiastes 7:13 Consider the works of God, for no one can correct what He has rejected.
Ecclesiastes 7:14 On a good day, enjoy good things, and in the day of evil, consider: God made one against the other, so that man may not find anything against himself.
Ecclesiastes 7:15 I have seen everything in the days of my vanity: there is a just man who perishes in his justice, and there is a wicked man who lives a long time in his wickedness.
Ecclesiastes 7:16 Do not be overly just, nor become wiser than necessary, lest you be astonished.
Ecclesiastes 7:17 Do not be excessively wicked, nor become foolish. Why will you die before your time?
Ecclesiastes 7:18 It is good to restrain yourself in these things and not withdraw your hand from them: for he who fears God keeps all the commandments.
Ecclesiastes 7:19 Wisdom is stronger than seven powerful men who rule a city.
Ecclesiastes 7:20 For there is scarcely any just man on earth, who does good and does not sin.
Ecclesiastes 7:21 Do not take to heart all the words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant cursing you.
Ecclesiastes 7:22 For your heart often knows that many others have cursed you.
Ecclesiastes 7:23 All these things I have tested in wisdom: I said, “I will be wise,” but it went far from me.
Ecclesiastes 7:24 It was further away than it had been, and more profound. Who can find it?
Ecclesiastes 7:25 I went around everything in my heart, so that I might know and consider and seek wisdom and reason, and so that I might know the wickedness of the fool, and the error of the imprudent:
Ecclesiastes 7:26 And I found a woman more bitter than death, who is the snare of the heart, and a snare of the hunters: he who pleases God will escape her: but he who is a sinner will be caught by her.
Ecclesiastes 7:27 Behold, this I have found, says Ecclesiastes, one after another to find reason.
Ecclesiastes 7:28 Which my soul still seeks, and has not found: among a thousand men I found one, but among all women I did not find one.
Ecclesiastes 7:29 This only have I found, that God made man upright, but he himself entangled himself in endless questions.
Ecclesiastes 8:1 Who is like the wise man, and who understands the meaning of a word? A man's wisdom illuminates his face, and his face is changed.
Ecclesiastes 8:2 I am instructed by the king and I obey the rules that God created.
Ecclesiastes 8:3 Do not be in a hurry to leave his presence, and do not persist in evil.
Ecclesiastes 8:4 Because he will do whatever he wants, and where the king's word is, there is power.
Ecclesiastes 8:5 Anyone who obeys a command will not feel anything bad. The wise heart knows the proper timing.
Ecclesiastes 8:6 Every matter has its own time and mode, and a lot of evil oppresses a man.
Ecclesiastes 8:7 Because he does not know what will happen: and who will tell him the future?
Ecclesiastes 8:8 A man does not have power over the spirit to restrain the spirit, nor power on the day of his death. He cannot win an evil conflict, nor can he save the one who is impious.
Ecclesiastes 8:9 All of these things I have observed, and I have given my heart to all the works which are done under the sun, when a man rules over another man to his evil.
Ecclesiastes 8:10 Then I saw the wicked buried, and those who worked in the holy place: and they were praised in the city for what they had done. And this is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 8:11 Because the sentence against the wicked is not quickly pronounced, therefore the children of men are full of evil hearts.
Ecclesiastes 8:12 Even if the impious sins a hundred times, and God seems to have prolonged his life, I know that it will be good for those who fear God, who revere His face.
Ecclesiastes 8:13 But it will not be good for the wicked man, nor will he prolong his shadow, as the shadow of a tree.
Ecclesiastes 8:14 There is a vanity which occurs on the earth: there are just men to whom evils happen, as if they were the works of the wicked, and there are wicked men to whom good things happen, as if they were the works of the just. This also is vanity.
Ecclesiastes 8:15 I therefore praised joy, because there is nothing better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink, and to be joyful, and that this should accompany him in his labor, during the days of his life, which God has given him under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 8:16 I set my heart to know wisdom, and to see the activity which is carried on in the earth: because my eyes do not take sleep, day or night.
Ecclesiastes 8:17 And I understood that all the works of God are, and a man cannot find the work that is done under the sun, and the more a man labors to seek, the less he will find.
Ecclesiastes 8:18 Again I applied my heart to know wisdom, and foolishness and imprudence. And I knew that this was vanity too:
Ecclesiastes 8:19 Because in much wisdom there is much sorrow, and whoever increases knowledge increases pain.
Ecclesiastes 9:1 I considered all these things within my heart, so that I could investigate them, and see that the righteous, the wise, and their works are in God's hand. Yet, humanity doesn’t know if they are worthy of love or hate.
Ecclesiastes 9:2 But one thing is certain, that all things come to the same end, because one fate befalls the righteous and the wicked, the good and the evil, the clean and the unclean, the one who sacrifices and the one who rejects sacrifice.
Ecclesiastes 9:3 Because of this, I think it is absurd that the same death awaits the just and the unjust; the good and the bad both die.
Ecclesiastes 9:4 Therefore, it is better for people to rejoice in their work, for this is their portion. Who can bring them back to know what is yet to come?
Ecclesiastes 9:5 Do everything that you can do in life, because neither work, nor reason, nor knowledge, nor wisdom will be in the grave, where you are hastening.
Ecclesiastes 9:6 I turned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the war to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor grace to the educated, nor riches to the skilled; but time and chance happen to them all.
Ecclesiastes 9:7 Humanity doesn’t know its end; but as fish are caught with a hook, and as birds are caught in a snare, so humans are trapped in evil times when it suddenly comes upon them.
Ecclesiastes 9:8 This, too, I have seen is wisdom, and is a great thing under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 9:9 There was a small city with few men in it; a great king came against it and surrounded it and built fortifications around it to attack it.
Ecclesiastes 9:10 A poor and wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city through his wisdom, but no one remembered that poor man afterwards.
Ecclesiastes 9:11 And I said wisdom is better than strength; and how the wisdom of the poor is despised, and his words are not heard.
Ecclesiastes 9:12 The words of the wise are heard in silence, more than the clamor of a prince among fools.
Ecclesiastes 9:13 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one who sins destroys many good things.
Ecclesiastes 9:14 A dead fly spoils the sweet scent of the ointment. Glory and wisdom are despised, and a little brief hunger is more than foolishness and stupidity.
Ecclesiastes 9:15 The words of the wise are gracious; the lips of a fool are his own destruction.
Ecclesiastes 9:16 Blessed are you, land, whose king is a boy, and whose princes eat in the morning.
Ecclesiastes 9:17 Blessed are you, land, whose king is noble and whose princes eat in due time, for food and not in luxury.
Ecclesiastes 9:18 Through laziness, the building decays; through the idleness of hands, the house drips.
Ecclesiastes 9:19 Men make a feast for laughter, and wine makes the living happy; and money answers everything.
Ecclesiastes 9:20 Do not curse the king, nor in your heart curse the rich; do not curse the birds of the sky, because even the birds of the sky will carry the word, and the one who has wings will announce the judgment.
Ecclesiastes 10:1 A dead fly ruins the value of perfumed oil, and wisdom and glory are more honorable than the foolishness of a little while.
Ecclesiastes 10:2 The heart of the wise man is on the right, and the heart of the fool is on the left.
Ecclesiastes 10:3 Even when the fool walks on the road, he thinks everyone else is a fool.
Ecclesiastes 10:4 If the authority of a ruler rises up against you, don't leave your place; because submission makes even great sins stop.
Ecclesiastes 10:5 There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, something that seems to come by accident from the presence of the ruler:
Ecclesiastes 10:6 A fool is placed in high office, while rich men are seated below.
Ecclesiastes 10:7 I have seen servants riding on horses, and princes walking like servants on the ground.
Ecclesiastes 10:8 The one who digs a pit will fall into it, and the one who breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent.
Ecclesiastes 10:9 The one who moves stones will be hurt by them, and the one who splits wood will be in danger from it.
Ecclesiastes 10:10 If the iron is blunt, and this is not sharp, but blunted, great effort is needed: and after hard work, wisdom will offer aid.
Ecclesiastes 10:11 If a serpent bites in silence, the whisperer is no less dangerous; he who secretly slanders, destroys his own soul.
Ecclesiastes 10:12 The words of the wise man’s mouth are gracious, but the lips of the fool swallow him.
Ecclesiastes 10:13 The beginning of his mouth’s words is foolishness, and the beginning of his mouth is the worst madness.
Ecclesiastes 10:14 The fool multiplies words.
Ecclesiastes 10:15 The ignorant man doesn't know what will happen, and who will tell him what will be after him?
Ecclesiastes 10:16 Woe to you, O land, whose king is a child, and whose leaders eat in the morning.
Ecclesiastes 10:17 Blessed is the land whose king is noble, and whose leaders eat at the right time, for strength, and not for excess.
Ecclesiastes 10:18 Through laziness the roof will fall in, and through idleness the house will decay.
Ecclesiastes 10:19 Feasting provides bread, and wine cheers the living, but money answers all things.
Ecclesiastes 10:20 Also, do not curse the king even in your thought, and do not curse the rich in your private chamber: for the birds of the sky will carry your voice, and the one with wings will report the word.
Ecclesiastes 11:1 Cast your bread upon the water, for in time you will find it.
Ecclesiastes 11:2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: for you do not know what evil will come upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes 11:3 If the clouds are filled, they will pour rain upon the earth. If a tree falls towards the south or the north, it will stay where it fell.
Ecclesiastes 11:4 Whoever watches the wind will not sow, and whoever observes the clouds will never reap.
Ecclesiastes 11:5 Just as you do not know the way of the spirit, or how bones are formed in the womb of a pregnant woman: so you do not know the work of God, who works everything.
Ecclesiastes 11:6 Cast your bread upon the surface of the waters: for after many days you will find it.
Ecclesiastes 11:7 Give a portion to seven, and even to eight: for you do not know what evil will be upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes 11:8 If the clouds are filled, they will pour rain upon the earth: and if a tree falls towards the north or the south, it will remain where it fell.
Ecclesiastes 11:9 Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes: and know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.
Ecclesiastes 11:10 Remove anger from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh. For youth and pleasure are vain.
Ecclesiastes 12:1 Remember your Creator in your youth, before the days of trial come, and the years draw near of which you will say, "I have no pleasure in them."
Ecclesiastes 12:2 Before the sun and the light, and the moon, and the stars are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain:
Ecclesiastes 12:3 When the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders in the mill shall be idle, and the grinders in the mill shall be idle, and the grinders be dark in the windows,
Ecclesiastes 12:4 And the door shall be shut in the street, when the voice of the grinder is low, and they shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low.
Ecclesiastes 12:5 And they shall be afraid of the high places, and they shall be afraid in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, the locust shall be made fat, and the caper fruit shall be scattered: because man goeth into the house of his eternity, and the mourners shall go about in the street.
Ecclesiastes 12:6 Before the silver cord be broken, and the golden fillet be broken, and the pitcher be broken over the fountain, and the wheel be broken over the cistern,
Ecclesiastes 12:7 And the dust return into its earth, from whence it was, and the spirit return to God who gave it.
Ecclesiastes 12:8 Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher, and all things are vanity.
Ecclesiastes 12:9 And whereas the Preacher was wise, he taught the people, and declared what he had done, and composed many parables.
Ecclesiastes 12:10 He sought to find profitable words, and to write truth, and to write truth of words.
Ecclesiastes 12:11 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails driven into the depths, which by the counsel of masters are given from one shepherd.
Ecclesiastes 12:12 And more than these, my son, be thou warned: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
Ecclesiastes 12:13 Let us all hear together the end of the discourse: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is all man.
Ecclesiastes 12:14 For God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
Song of Solomon 1:1 Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth: Because your affections are better than wine,
Song of Solomon 1:2 And the fragrance of your perfumes. Your name is good, like oil poured out, therefore the young girls love you.
Song of Solomon 1:3 Draw me to you, and we will follow you. You will guide us by your affection. The king brought me into his wine cellar. We will be glad and rejoice in you, remembering your affections better than wine.
Song of Solomon 1:4 You will find great favor and love in them.
Song of Solomon 1:5 I am dark, but beautiful, daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
Song of Solomon 1:6 Don't look down on me because I am dark, because the sun has darkened my skin. My mother's sons were angry with me, and forced me to be a keeper of the vineyards, but I did not watch over my own vineyard.
Song of Solomon 1:7 Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you feed your flock, where you rest at noon, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of your companions.
Song of Solomon 1:8 If you do not know, fairest among women, go forth, and follow the footsteps of the flock, and feed your kids near the tents of the shepherds.
Song of Solomon 1:9 To my team of horses in Pharaoh's chariots, I have brought you, my love.
Song of Solomon 1:10 Your cheeks are as beautiful as a dove, your neck like jewels.
Song of Solomon 1:11 We will make you gold ornaments, and decorate them with silver.
Song of Solomon 1:12 While the king was reclining, my nard gave its fragrance.
Song of Solomon 1:13 My beloved is a bundle of myrrh to me: it shall lie between my breasts.
Song of Solomon 1:14 My beloved is a cluster of cypress to me in the vineyards of Engaddi.
Song of Solomon 1:15 Behold, you are beautiful, my love, behold, you are beautiful: your eyes are like doves.
Song of Solomon 1:16 Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, and delightful: our bed is blooming.
Song of Solomon 1:17 The covering of our houses is cedar, and our ceilings are cypress.
Song of Solomon 2:1 I am like a flower in the field, and a lily of the valleys.
Song of Solomon 2:2 As the lily is among the thorns, so is my beloved among the daughters.
Song of Solomon 2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons.
Song of Solomon 2:4 I have desired to sit under His shadow, and His fruit is sweet to my throat.
Song of Solomon 2:5 He brought me into the wine cellar, and He established charity in me.
Song of Solomon 2:6 Strengthen me with flowers, surround me with apples, because I languish with love.
Song of Solomon 2:7 His left hand is under my head, and His right hand will embrace me.
Song of Solomon 2:8 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and the hinds of the fields, that you do not rouse, nor awaken my beloved, until she herself wishes.
Song of Solomon 2:9 The voice of my beloved! Behold, this one comes, leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills.
Song of Solomon 2:10 My beloved is like a gazelle, or a young hart. Behold, He stands behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the lattices.
Song of Solomon 2:11 Behold my beloved speaks to me: “Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come.”
Song of Solomon 2:12 For now the winter is past, the rain is gone and departed.
Song of Solomon 2:13 The flowers have appeared in the land, the time of pruning has come.
Song of Solomon 2:14 The voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
Song of Solomon 2:15 The fig tree has produced its green figs: the vines in bloom have given their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come.
Song of Solomon 2:16 My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, show me your face, let your voice sound in my ears: for your voice is sweet, and your face is beautiful.
Song of Solomon 2:17 Catch the little foxes that spoil the vines: for our vines have flourished.
Song of Solomon 2:18 My beloved is for me, and I am for Him, who feeds among the lilies.
Song of Solomon 3:1 I went to my bed in the night, seeking the one whom my soul loves: I sought him, and I did not find him.
Song of Solomon 3:2 I will get up, and I will go around the city: through the streets and the squares, I will seek the one whom my soul loves. I sought him, and I did not find him.
Song of Solomon 3:3 The watchmen found me, those who guard the city: “Have you seen the one whom my soul loves?”
Song of Solomon 3:4 A little further on, I found the one whom my soul loves: I held him, and I will not let him go until I bring him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her who bore me.
Song of Solomon 3:5 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and the hinds of the fields, that you not stir up, nor awake the beloved, until she desires it.
Song of Solomon 3:6 Who is this, ascending through the desert like a column of smoke from the perfumes of myrrh, and frankincense, and every powder of the perfumer?
Song of Solomon 3:7 Behold, the bed of Solomon: sixty strong men surround it, of the strongest of Israel.
Song of Solomon 3:8 All holding swords, and warriors, each man has his sword upon his thigh, because of the fear of the night.
Song of Solomon 3:9 King Solomon made himself a bed, from the wood of Lebanon.
Song of Solomon 3:10 He made its columns of silver: the support of gold, the ascent of purple; he paved the middle with charity, on account of the daughters of Jerusalem.
Song of Solomon 3:11 Go out, and see the daughters of Zion, in the bed where his mother comforted him, where she bore him.
Song of Solomon 4:1 How beautiful you are, my love! How beautiful you are! Your eyes are like doves, hidden from those who would do you harm.
Song of Solomon 4:2 Your hair is like a flock of goats that descends from Mount Gilead.
Song of Solomon 4:3 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep that has come up from washing, all of which are twin, and there is no barren one among them.
Song of Solomon 4:4 Your lips are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate, hidden from those who would do you harm.
Song of Solomon 4:5 Your neck is like the tower of David, built with ramparts: a thousand shields hang from it, all the armor of the strong.
Song of Solomon 4:6 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, which graze among the lilies.
Song of Solomon 4:7 Until the day breathes, and the shadows decline, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of incense.
Song of Solomon 4:8 You are entirely beautiful, my love; there is no stain in you.
Song of Solomon 4:9 Come from Lebanon, my spouse, come from Lebanon, come and descend; you will be crowned from the head of Amana, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.
Song of Solomon 4:10 You have wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have wounded my heart with one look of your eyes, and with one strand of hair on your neck.
Song of Solomon 4:11 How beautiful are your breasts, my sister, my spouse! Your breasts are more beautiful than wine, and the fragrance of your perfumes is above all spices.
Song of Solomon 4:12 Your lips, my spouse, drip like honey; milk and honey are under your tongue: and the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of incense.
Song of Solomon 4:13 A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed.
Song of Solomon 4:14 Your plants are a paradise of pomegranates with fruit; the cypress is with spikenard.
Song of Solomon 4:15 Spikenard and saffron, cinnamon and calamus, with all the trees of Lebanon; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief perfumes.
Song of Solomon 4:16 Awake, north wind, and come, south wind; blow upon my garden, and let its spices flow. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat the fruit of his choice fruits.
Song of Solomon 5:1 I came to my garden, my sister, my bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spices: I have eaten the honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, and drink; and be inebriated, dearest ones.
Song of Solomon 5:2 I sleep, but my heart stays awake. Listen! The voice of my beloved, knocking! Open to me, my sister, my friend, my dove, my spotless one: for my head is full of dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
Song of Solomon 5:3 I have taken off my tunic; how shall I put it on again? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
Song of Solomon 5:4 My beloved put his hand in at the hole, and my bowels trembled at his touch.
Song of Solomon 5:5 I arose to open to my beloved: my hands dropped myrrh, and my fingers were full of the best myrrh.
Song of Solomon 5:6 I opened the door of my house to my beloved: but he had turned aside, and was gone. My soul melted when he spoke. I sought him, and did not find him: I called him, and he did not answer me.
Song of Solomon 5:7 The watchmen that go about the city found me: they struck me and wounded me: the keepers of the walls took away my cloak.
Song of Solomon 5:8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I languish with love.
Song of Solomon 5:9 What is your beloved more than another beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you have so charged us?
Song of Solomon 5:10 My beloved is white and ruddy: chosen out of thousands.
Song of Solomon 5:11 His head is like the finest gold: his locks are as the branches of palm trees, black as a raven.
Song of Solomon 5:12 His eyes are like doves upon the brooks of waters, which are washed in milk, and sit near the fullest streams.
Song of Solomon 5:13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, where the fragrant herbs are. His lips are lilies, dropping the finest myrrh.
Song of Solomon 5:14 His hands are rings of gold, filled with hyacinths. His belly is ivory, distinguished by sapphires.
Song of Solomon 5:15 His legs are marble pillars, which are set upon golden bases. His appearance is like that of Lebanon.
Song of Solomon 5:16 His throat is most sweet, and altogether desirable. Such is my beloved, and he is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
Song of Solomon 6:1 Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned aside, and we will seek him with you?
Song of Solomon 6:2 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to graze in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
Song of Solomon 6:3 I am for my beloved, and my beloved is for me, who grazes among the lilies.
Song of Solomon 6:4 You are beautiful, my friend, as Thersa, beautiful as Jerusalem, fearsome as an army set in array.
Song of Solomon 6:5 Turn away your eyes from me, for they have made me fly away.
Song of Solomon 6:6 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep which have come up from the washing, all twins, and there is not one barren among them.
Song of Solomon 6:7 Like a piece of pomegranate are your cheeks, within your veil.
Song of Solomon 6:8 There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and young women without number:
Song of Solomon 6:9 My dove is one, my perfect one is one, she is the only one of her mother, chosen by her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; the queens and concubines, and they praised her.
Song of Solomon 6:10 Who is she that comes forth like the dawn rising, beautiful as the moon, chosen as the sun, fearsome as an army set in array?
Song of Solomon 6:11 I went down to the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valley, and to examine if the vine had flourished, and if the pomegranates had sprouted.
Song of Solomon 6:12 I knew not; my soul disturbed me. I set my soul, that I might hear;
Song of Solomon 6:13 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon you.
Song of Solomon 7:1 How beautiful you are! How lovely, dearest, in your delights!
Song of Solomon 7:2 Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts, like clusters of dates.
Song of Solomon 7:3 I said: “I will go up into the palm tree, and seize its fruits.”
Song of Solomon 7:4 And let your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the fragrance of your breath like apples.
Song of Solomon 7:5 Your throat is like the best wine, which flows for my beloved, bringing the lips of those asleep and their teeth to life.
Song of Solomon 7:6 I am for my beloved, and his desire is for me.
Song of Solomon 7:7 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields, and stay in the villages.
Song of Solomon 7:8 In the morning, let us arise to the vineyards. Let us see if the vine has flowered, if the flowers have opened, if the pomegranates have borne fruit. There I will give you my breasts.
Song of Solomon 7:9 The mandrakes give off their fragrance. At our gates are all kinds of fruits, both new and old; my beloved, I have kept them for you.
Song of Solomon 7:10 I have stored up new and old fruits for you, my beloved.
Song of Solomon 7:11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields, and stay in the villages.
Song of Solomon 7:12 In the morning, let us arise to the vineyards. Let us see if the vine has flowered, if the flowers have opened, if the pomegranates have borne fruit. There I will give you my breasts.
Song of Solomon 7:13 The mandrakes give off their fragrance at our gates: all kinds of fruits, both new and old, my beloved, I have stored up for you.
Song of Solomon 8:1 Oh, that you were like a brother to me, nourished at my mother’s breast! Then I could find you outside, and kiss you, and no one would despise me anymore!
Song of Solomon 8:2 I would lead you, and bring you into my mother's house: there you would teach me. I would give you spiced wine, and the sweetest new wine.
Song of Solomon 8:3 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
Song of Solomon 8:4 I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, do not stir, or awaken my love, until she wants to.
Song of Solomon 8:5 Who is this coming up from the wilderness, overflowing with delights, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was corrupted, there she who bore you was defiled.
Song of Solomon 8:6 Put me like a seal on your heart, like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, jealousy is as hard as hell. Its lamps are lamps of fire and flame.
Song of Solomon 8:7 Many waters cannot extinguish love, nor can the floods overwhelm it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, he would be utterly despised.
Song of Solomon 8:8 We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for?
Song of Solomon 8:9 If she is a wall, let us build on her battlements of silver. If she is a door, let us enclose her with boards of cedar.
Song of Solomon 8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Therefore, I am in his eyes as one who has found peace.
Song of Solomon 8:11 Solomon had a vineyard in Baalhamon. He entrusted the vineyard to keepers; each was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
Song of Solomon 8:12 My own vineyard is before me. The thousand are yours, Solomon, and two hundred for those who guard its fruit.
Song of Solomon 8:13 You who dwell in the gardens, my companions are listening; let me hear your voice.
Song of Solomon 8:14 Hasten, my beloved, and be like a gazelle, or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
Wisdom 1:1 Love justice, all you who are judges of the earth. Think of the Lord with goodness, and seek Him with a simple heart.
Wisdom 1:2 He is found by those who do not test Him, and He appears to those who have faith in Him.
Wisdom 1:3 Perverse thoughts separate one from God, but virtue corrects those who are unwise.
Wisdom 1:4 For wisdom will not enter into a malevolent soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.
Wisdom 1:5 The Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the false, and will depart from thoughts that are without understanding, and will be rejected by the reprobate.
Wisdom 1:6 Wisdom is a friend to man, and will not leave the wicked because of the words of his lips, for God is the witness of his conscience, the examiner of his heart, and the observer of his tongue.
Wisdom 1:7 For the Lord is the spirit of wisdom, and He knows all things, and He who knows all things, knows wisdom, and He who has created wisdom, has investigated wisdom.
Wisdom 1:8 For He loves those who dwell with wisdom.
Wisdom 1:9 For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the arrangement of the stars: being compared to light, she is found to be first.
Wisdom 1:10 After this, night, malice, and death follow.
Wisdom 1:11 But those who remain in her will not fear, but will rest with her.
Wisdom 1:12 For death and life are in her hand, and good will is pleasing to her.
Wisdom 1:13 He who displeases her, becomes so through hatred, wickedness, and sins.
Wisdom 1:14 For sometimes she is with the wicked, but wickedness will not be believed.
Wisdom 1:15 For he who hopes in vanity generates the wind, and he who follows flying birds, pursues foolishness.
Wisdom 1:16 For he departs from the Lord and from the wisdom of His Spirit.
Wisdom 1:17 For the wicked do not speak well of what belongs to God, and those who are without discipline cannot keep her.
Wisdom 1:18 For the Holy Spirit is divided from them, and has departed from their thoughts.
Wisdom 1:19 For wisdom is a loving spirit, and will not acquit the blasphemer from his lips, for God is the witness of his conscience, and the examiner of his heart, and the observer of his tongue.
Wisdom 2:1 Fools think wrongly. Their thoughts are empty and confused.
Wisdom 2:2 They say, “Our life is short and full of sorrows, and there is no cure for death, and no one returns from the grave.”
Wisdom 2:3 We were born by chance, and after this, there will be nothing. Death is like a final seal: no one can come back.
Wisdom 2:4 We came from nothing and will return to nothing. Our breath is like smoke in our nostrils, and our thoughts are like a spark that leaps in our hearts.
Wisdom 2:5 When the body is extinguished, it will turn to ashes, and the spirit will vanish like soft air.
Wisdom 2:6 In time, our name will be forgotten, and no one will remember our deeds.
Wisdom 2:7 We pass like a shadow and cannot return. It is sealed: no one can return.
Wisdom 2:8 Come, then, let us enjoy the good things that are here. Let us enjoy the pleasures of youth.
Wisdom 2:9 Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and perfumes, and let the flowers of spring pass us by.
Wisdom 2:10 Let us crown ourselves with roses before they wither. Let none of us be without our share of our luxury.
Wisdom 2:11 Let us have power over the just; for that which is weak is useless.
Wisdom 2:12 Let us oppress the poor and the just, and let us not spare the widow. Let us show no respect for the gray hairs of the old.
Wisdom 2:13 Let our strength be our law of justice, for the weak are shown to be useless.
Wisdom 2:14 So let us lay traps for the just, because they are of no use to us, and they are against our deeds. They condemn us for the sins of our life.
Wisdom 2:15 They claim to have knowledge of God and call themselves the children of God.
Wisdom 2:16 They are a rebuke to our thoughts, and just to look at them is a burden to us.
Wisdom 2:17 Their life is not like that of others, and their ways are different.
Wisdom 2:18 We are regarded as counterfeit coins, and they avoid our ways as if they were unclean.
Wisdom 2:19 They consider the end of the just to be blessed, and they boast of God as their father.
Wisdom 2:20 Let us see, then, if their words are true. Let us test what will happen to them.
Wisdom 2:21 If the just one is truly the Son of God, God will help him and deliver him from the hands of his enemies.
Wisdom 2:22 Let us test him with insult and torture, so that we can understand his gentleness and know his patience.
Wisdom 2:23 Let us condemn him to a most shameful death, for he will be protected, as he claims, by his own words.
Wisdom 2:24 This is what they thought, and they were wrong, for their wickedness blinded them.
Wisdom 2:25 They did not know the mysteries of God, nor did they think that justice would be rewarded or that the souls of the saints would be recompensed.
Wisdom 2:26 For God created man to be imperishable, and He made him in the image of his own likeness.
Wisdom 2:27 By the devil’s envy, death entered the world,
Wisdom 2:28 and those who belong to him imitate him.
Wisdom 3:1 The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and torment will not touch them.
Wisdom 3:2 Fools thought the just were dead, and they considered their death a punishment,
Wisdom 3:3 and their departure an utter destruction;
Wisdom 3:4 but they are at peace.
Wisdom 3:5 And though in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality.
Wisdom 3:6 Having been punished in a few things, they will receive many blessings, for God tested them,
Wisdom 3:7 and found them worthy of Himself.
Wisdom 3:8 As gold in the furnace, He has tried them, and as a holocaust offering, He received them.
Wisdom 3:9 And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and shall run to and fro as sparks among the reeds.
Wisdom 3:10 They shall judge the nations, and rule over the peoples, and the Lord will reign over them forever.
Wisdom 3:11 Those who trust in Him will understand the truth, and those who are faithful in love will abide in Him; for grace and peace is to His elect.
Wisdom 3:12 But the wicked will suffer their own condemnation, who have departed from justice.
Wisdom 3:13 For it is better not to be, than to live and work wickedness.
Wisdom 3:14 Certainly, those who think evil and speak impious things will be punished more severely.
Wisdom 3:15 For the hope of the impious is like fluff which is taken away by the wind, and like thin foam that is dispersed by a storm: and like smoke dispersed by the wind,
Wisdom 3:16 and like the memory of a guest who stayed a single day that quickly passes.
Wisdom 3:17 But the just shall live forever, and their reward is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the Most High.
Wisdom 3:18 Therefore they shall receive a kingdom of glory and a crown of beauty from the hand of the Lord: because with His right hand He will protect them, and with His arm He will defend them.
Wisdom 3:19 For He will take His zeal as armor, and creation as a weapon to avenge the enemies.
Wisdom 3:20 He will put on justice as a breastplate, and will take the helmet of sincere judgment.
Wisdom 3:21 He will take invulnerable holiness as a shield,
Wisdom 3:22 and He will sharpen severe anger as a sword.
Wisdom 3:23 The whole world will be gathered against the foolish.
Wisdom 3:24 And they will go forth, rejoicing in their scourging.
Wisdom 4:1 It is better to be childless, if that keeps you virtuous, because virtue's legacy is immortal, and it is honored by both God and humanity.
Wisdom 4:2 When virtue is present, it imitates God. The memory of it is honored, because it is with God and with all humanity.
Wisdom 4:3 When virtue is present, it stirs up other virtuous deeds, and it crowns the incorruptible victory of eternity.
Wisdom 4:4 The unjust are quickly destroyed by wickedness, and the offspring of the impious will not have a solid foundation.
Wisdom 4:5 Even if the wicked live a long life, they are considered to be nothing. Their old age is without any honor.
Wisdom 4:6 Even if they die quickly, they have no hope, nor comfort on judgment day.
Wisdom 4:7 The end of the wicked is horrific.
Wisdom 4:8 Even if the just die young, they will be at peace.
Wisdom 4:9 For honorable old age is not measured by the passing of time or the number of years, but by the wisdom of a just man, and old age is a blameless life.
Wisdom 4:10 The one who is pleasing to God is beloved, and the one who has lived among sinners is taken away, so that wickedness does not corrupt his mind, nor deception deceive his soul.
Wisdom 4:11 For the fascination of evil obscures goodness, and the instability of lust perverts the mind without malice.
Wisdom 4:12 Having become perfect in a short time, he lived a long life. Because his soul was pleasing to God, God hurried to take him from the midst of wickedness.
Wisdom 4:13 The people see, but they don't understand, nor do they take it to heart. God's grace, mercy, and concern are with His holy ones, His chosen ones.
Wisdom 4:14 He who dies justly is at peace.
Wisdom 4:15 I understood this, that wisdom is good, and I worked at it in my life. I pursued it, and I was zealous for good things.
Wisdom 4:16 For loving justice is the perfection of wisdom, and knowing His power is the root of the kingdom.
Wisdom 4:17 If you govern provinces and judge nations, the kings will admire wisdom.
Wisdom 4:18 Because they have heard about its wisdom, they have told others about it. And those who have heard it have been amazed by it.
Wisdom 4:19 If wisdom reigns, it will be honored forever. For glory passes quickly, but wisdom remains forever.
Wisdom 5:1 Then the just will stand with great certainty against those who tormented them, and who took away their labors.
Wisdom 5:2 Seeing this, the wicked will be thrown into terrible fear, and they will be amazed at this unexpected salvation.
Wisdom 5:3 They will say to themselves, repenting, and groaning in anguish of spirit: "This is the one we once held up to ridicule and in a form of contempt."
Wisdom 5:4 We foolish ones considered his life to be madness and his end without honor.
Wisdom 5:5 How, then, has he been numbered among the sons of God, and how is his lot among the saints?
Wisdom 5:6 Therefore, we have strayed from the way of truth, and the light of justice did not shine upon us, nor did the sun rise for us.
Wisdom 5:7 We have been oppressed by the way of wickedness and destruction, and we have walked difficult paths, but we have not known the way of the Lord.
Wisdom 5:8 What has pride done for us? Or what profit did the boasting of riches give to us?
Wisdom 5:9 All those things have passed away like a shadow, and like a messenger, they have flown away.
Wisdom 5:10 And like a ship that passes through a wave, whose past is not found, nor the trace of its path in the wake of the waves.
Wisdom 5:11 Or like a bird that passes through the air, whose path leaves no trace, but only the striking of the wind, and the light impulse of the air, which it passed through.
Wisdom 5:12 Or like an arrow shot into the body, dividing the air, which immediately is united again: so also we, being born, immediately ceased to be.
Wisdom 5:13 Indeed, our hope is extinguished, like down: and in winter, it is scattered like a leaf from a tree.
Wisdom 5:14 For all our life has passed away like a shadow, and there is no return after our death: and it is sealed and confirmed, because no one returns.
Wisdom 5:15 Therefore, blessed are the just who are in the Lord, and blessed are those who have hoped in the Lord: and those who were in them did not look to vanity, nor did they know vanity.
Wisdom 5:16 These, in the day of their visitation, will shine, and like sparks, they will run in the branches.
Wisdom 5:17 They will judge the nations, and they will rule over the peoples: and the Lord will reign over them forever.
Wisdom 5:18 Those who trust in him will understand the truth, and those who are faithful in love will remain in him: because grace and peace belong to His elect.
Wisdom 6:1 All you who judge the earth: love righteousness, and feel the goodness of God, and seek Him with a simple heart.
Wisdom 6:2 He is found by those who do not test Him, and He will appear to those who have faith in Him.
Wisdom 6:3 Evil thoughts separate you from God. But the power of God will expose the wicked.
Wisdom 6:4 For wisdom will not enter a hateful soul, nor will it dwell in a body held in sin.
Wisdom 6:5 The Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from what is fake, and will remove Himself from thoughts that lack understanding, and He will be rejected by the proud.
Wisdom 6:6 Because wisdom is far from pride, and it will never embrace a lie.
Wisdom 6:7 The wise, disciplined, and understanding person will flee from wickedness.
Wisdom 6:8 For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from what is fake, and will remove Himself from thoughts that lack understanding, and He will be rejected by the proud.
Wisdom 6:9 The Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from what is fake, and will remove Himself from thoughts that lack understanding, and He will be rejected by the proud.
Wisdom 6:10 The beginning of wisdom is to fear God. To understand the good is to obey the law of God.
Wisdom 6:11 The reign of righteousness is holiness and His glory; and its end is a holy life.
Wisdom 6:12 If you love thrones, rulers, and scepters, love wisdom, so you may reign forever.
Wisdom 6:13 For what is quicker than wisdom, which does all things?
Wisdom 6:14 And if virtue is loved, these virtues are the works of wisdom. It teaches temperance, prudence, justice, and fortitude; nothing is more useful to men in life.
Wisdom 6:15 If anyone desires extensive experience, wisdom knows the past, and she estimates what is to come.
Wisdom 6:16 It knows the cunning of speech, and the answers to arguments. She knows signs and wonders before they happen.
Wisdom 6:17 I therefore determined to take her as my life, and my good, and riches; and I did not compare her to any precious stone.
Wisdom 6:18 Because she precedes all good things and comes to me with every good thing.
Wisdom 6:19 All good things came to me together with her, and countless blessings through her hands.
Wisdom 6:20 And I rejoiced in them all, because she followed me.
Wisdom 6:21 I did not know that she was the mother of all these things. For I learned without pretense, and I share without envy, and I do not hide her riches.
Wisdom 6:22 For she is a treasure to men without blemish; those who have used her have obtained the friendship of God, and are commended because of the works of discipline.
Wisdom 6:23 Therefore I prayed, and understanding was given to me. I called on her, and the Spirit of wisdom came to me.
Wisdom 6:24 And I preferred her to kingdoms and thrones, and I considered riches nothing in comparison to her.
Wisdom 6:25 Nor did I compare her to a precious stone, because all gold, in comparison to her, is but a grain of sand, and silver will be considered as mud before her.
Wisdom 6:26 I loved her above health and beauty, and I determined to have her as my light, because her illumination is never extinguished.
Wisdom 6:27 But all good things came to me together with her, and endless blessings through her hands.
Wisdom 7:1 I also am a mortal man, similar to you, and from the earth, earthy.
Wisdom 7:2 And in my mother's womb, I was formed in the flesh.
Wisdom 7:3 Born at one time, I will share the same departure from life.
Wisdom 7:4 But I will call upon all: “God of wisdom, and Spirit of understanding, come into me.”
Wisdom 7:5 A throne of royalty is prepared for me, and I said: “Spouse and dwelling, and all of her works, are mine.”
Wisdom 7:6 God gave me true knowledge, and the knowledge of the saints, so that I might know the order of the ages and the power of the elements,
Wisdom 7:7 the beginning, end, and middle of times; changes of the times, and the turnings of the ages.
Wisdom 7:8 For I know every manifest and hidden thing. I know all things that are and are to come.
Wisdom 7:9 Wisdom, the maker of all things, taught me. For she taught me.
Wisdom 7:10 In her is the understanding spirit, holy, unique, multifaceted, subtle, mobile, eloquent, unpolluted, clear, unharmed, loving good, sharp,
Wisdom 7:11 free, beneficent, humane, stable, certain, quiet, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating all intelligent spirits, pure, and most subtle.
Wisdom 7:12 For wisdom is more mobile than all that is mobile. Because of her purity, she penetrates and pervades all things.
Wisdom 7:13 For she is a vapor of the power of God and a clear emanation of the glory of the Almighty God; therefore, nothing impure enters into her.
Wisdom 7:14 For she is the brightness of eternal light, and a mirror without blemish of God’s majesty, and the image of His goodness.
Wisdom 7:15 And although she is one, she can do all things. Remaining in herself, she renews all things, and through the nations she transfers herself to holy souls, making them friends of God and prophets.
Wisdom 7:16 For her friendship is good, and her works are honorable.
Wisdom 7:17 For she teaches temperance and prudence, justice and virtue. Nothing is more useful to men in life than these things.
Wisdom 7:18 If anyone loves justice, her labors are virtues. For she teaches temperance and prudence, than which nothing is more useful to men in life.
Wisdom 7:19 But if anyone desires much experience, she knows the past, and judges of the future. She knows the subtleties of words and the solving of riddles. She knows signs and wonders before they happen, and the events of the times.
Wisdom 7:20 So, I proposed all these things to myself and brought them in together with her, because wisdom, the maker of all things, taught me.
Wisdom 7:21 For in her is an understanding spirit, holy, unique, multifaceted, subtle, mobile, eloquent, unpolluted, clear, unharmed, loving good, sharp, free, beneficent, humane, stable, certain, quiet, all-powerful, overseeing all, and penetrating all intelligent spirits, pure, and most subtle.
Wisdom 7:22 For receiving wisdom, I will share with the good, and I will be approved by Him who is from the beginning.
Wisdom 8:1 Wisdom reaches from one end of the universe to the other with strength and orders everything gently.
Wisdom 8:2 I have always loved wisdom, seeking her since my earliest youth.
Wisdom 8:3 I desired to marry her. I loved her beauty.
Wisdom 8:4 Her lineage comes from God, and God loves those who live with her.
Wisdom 8:5 Her discipline leads to immortality, and remembering her means understanding God's will.
Wisdom 8:6 If you love thrones and scepters, O rulers of the people, then honor wisdom, that you may reign forever.
Wisdom 8:7 What is wisdom, and how was she made? I will tell you. I will not hide the secrets of God from you.
Wisdom 8:8 I am the beginning of her generation, and I am ordered by the knowledge of God.
Wisdom 8:9 I will proclaim her knowledge and her works, and I will not hide the secrets of God from you.
Wisdom 8:10 I am always with Him, and I am one with Him in everything.
Wisdom 8:11 From eternity, I have existed, and I will never fail, nor will I abandon those who love me.
Wisdom 8:12 When I came to know that wisdom was good, I sought her out.
Wisdom 8:13 I knew that I would not possess her unless God gave her to me. This was a proper and correct understanding.
Wisdom 8:14 Then, I was a good youth, and I acquired a good soul.
Wisdom 8:15 Indeed, though I was good, I came into an unblemished body.
Wisdom 8:16 And knowing that I could not be chaste unless God gave it, and that was wisdom itself—to know that it was a gift—I approached the Lord and begged Him.
Wisdom 8:17 Then I said in my heart, “Father, Lord of mercy, I ask You, give me wisdom, which attends You on Your throne, and is with me in my works.”
Wisdom 8:18 And do not cast me out from among Your children.
Wisdom 8:19 For I am Your servant, the son of Your handmaid. Send wisdom from Your holy seat and from the throne of Your glory, that she may be with me and labor with me, so that I may know what is pleasing to You.
Wisdom 8:20 For she knows and understands all things. She will guide me in my works prudently and will guard me.
Wisdom 8:21 Then my works will be acceptable, and I will judge Your people justly, and I will be worthy of my father's throne.
Wisdom 8:22 For who of men can know the counsel of God? Or who can understand what God wills?
Wisdom 8:23 The thoughts of mortals are timid, and our plans are uncertain.
Wisdom 8:24 The body that decays weighs down the soul, and the earthly dwelling depresses the mind, which thinks much.
Wisdom 8:25 And we can barely guess what is on earth, and what is before our eyes we find with difficulty.
Wisdom 8:26 But who can investigate the things in the heavens?
Wisdom 8:27 For who will know Your will unless You give wisdom and send Your Holy Spirit from the highest heavens?
Wisdom 8:28 Then the paths of those on earth were set right, and men learned what pleases You.
Wisdom 8:29 For through wisdom, those who have pleased You, Lord, since the beginning, were healed.
Wisdom 9:1 O Lord, God of our fathers and God of mercy, You made all things by Your word,
Wisdom 9:2 and by Your wisdom You formed man, so that he might govern the creatures that You made,
Wisdom 9:3 and that he might rule the world in holiness and justice, and judge with an upright heart:
Wisdom 9:4 give me wisdom, who sits beside Your throne, and do not cast me out from among Your children:
Wisdom 9:5 because I am Your servant and the son of Your handmaid, a man weak in mind and short of understanding, and lacking in the knowledge of Your laws.
Wisdom 9:6 For even if someone is perfect among the sons of men, without Your wisdom he will be held as nothing.
Wisdom 9:7 And even if he were perfect, without Your wisdom he would be regarded as nothing.
Wisdom 9:8 I have been with You, wisdom, and the worker of Your thrones, and I do not know Your works, nor what I should do.
Wisdom 9:9 For what man can know the counsel of God? Or who can understand what God wills?
Wisdom 9:10 For the thoughts of mortals are fearful, and our understandings are uncertain.
Wisdom 9:11 For the body that corrupts weighs down the soul, and this earthly dwelling depresses the understanding that contemplates many things.
Wisdom 9:12 And with difficulty we strive, and we labor, and we have evil things in the present.
Wisdom 9:13 For who knows what is in heaven, except the one who comes down from heaven?
Wisdom 9:14 And who has known Your counsel, unless You have given wisdom, and sent Your Holy Spirit from on high?
Wisdom 9:15 And thus the paths of those on earth were set right, and they learned those things that please You, and by wisdom they were saved.
Wisdom 9:16 For through this have those pleased You been healed, O Lord, from the beginning.
Wisdom 9:17 For even if the son who comes to You is small, he will have wisdom with You, and will not despise You.
Wisdom 9:18 For God knows this, and dwells with wisdom, and will be ruled by wisdom.
Wisdom 10:1 Wisdom protected the just, even when the wicked were being killed, and the just escaped from death.
Wisdom 10:2 Wisdom escapes the wrath of the wicked and reveals the way of the just, even within their own errors.
Wisdom 10:3 She received the just who fled to her, and she did not abandon them during their trials, but delivered them from the snares of the wicked.
Wisdom 10:4 And she led them along the right path and revealed to them the kingdom of God, giving them the knowledge of the holy ones. And she kept them safe during difficult times.
Wisdom 10:5 She delivered the just from their wickedness and did not reject them, but turned away from the wicked when the judgment of the just came.
Wisdom 10:6 And the race of the wicked entered into wrath, who were together with the sorrowing.
Wisdom 10:7 When the multitude of the dead was being taken away, the justice of the Lord did not forget them.
Wisdom 10:8 But giving recompense to the wicked nations and taking vengeance.
Wisdom 10:9 For then, the mortals saw that they were suffering for their sins and, when they were condemned to vanity, they saw that they had suffered in vain.
Wisdom 10:10 For, just as children fleeing to the light and being cast off by death, so these also perished, and the just became participants in the suffering of death.
Wisdom 10:11 And in this thing, when they were, they saw and knew that the just were those whom God had rejected.
Wisdom 10:12 Because of this, they mocked their suffering and, in the pain of their death, despised them, as to what their end would be.
Wisdom 10:13 Then they will come to their judgment, and they will be terrified by fear, and they will marvel at the salvation of the unjust.
Wisdom 10:14 For those who did not believe in God before, but turned away from God, those who hated wisdom and despised her reproofs.
Wisdom 10:15 These, when they were, did not find the ways of justice and did not look upon the light of justice, nor did they receive the splendor of the sun's rays.
Wisdom 10:16 They walked along the wicked way and the paths of destruction, and they did not know the way of the Lord.
Wisdom 10:17 For what did pride profit them? Or what did the boast of riches bring to them?
Wisdom 10:18 All those things passed away like a shadow, and like a messenger hastening.
Wisdom 10:19 And like a ship passing through the sea, whose trace could not be found, nor the path of the keel in the waves.
Wisdom 10:20 Or like a bird flying through the air, for which there is no sign of its passing, but only the air that has been struck and the light, easy movement of wings, afterwards no sign of its path is found.
Wisdom 10:21 Or like an arrow shot at a target, which divided the air and then immediately cut it again, and no trace of its passage could be found.
Wisdom 10:22 So also we, when born, immediately ceased and could show no sign of virtue, but we have been consumed in our wickedness.
Wisdom 11:1 Lord, listen to my plea. Hear my prayer.
Wisdom 11:2 Don't bring your servant to judgment. No one alive can be found perfect in your sight.
Wisdom 11:3 The enemy has pursued my soul and brought my life down to the dirt.
Wisdom 11:4 He has put me in darkness like the dead, and my spirit is exhausted. My heart is deeply troubled.
Wisdom 11:5 I remember the days of old; I reflect on everything you have done, and I meditate on the works of your hands.
Wisdom 11:6 I stretch out my hands to you, my soul is like dry land.
Wisdom 11:7 Answer me quickly, Lord; my spirit fails. Don't turn away your face from me, or I'll be like those who descend into the pit.
Wisdom 11:8 Let me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I trust in you. Make known to me the way I should walk, because I lift up my soul to you.
Wisdom 11:9 Rescue me from my enemies, Lord; I flee to you for refuge.
Wisdom 11:10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. May your good Spirit guide me on a straight path.
Wisdom 11:11 For your name's sake, Lord, revive me in your righteousness. Bring my soul out of trouble.
Wisdom 11:12 And in your mercy, destroy my enemies and destroy all those who afflict my soul, because I am your servant.
Wisdom 12:1 Your judgments are magnificent, and no one can fully explain what you say.
Wisdom 12:2 And so those who haven't learned have gone astray. The simpleminded have thought unjust things were just, and have considered evil things to be good.
Wisdom 12:3 In this, the good and the evil are the same. Each will be judged on his own life.
Wisdom 12:4 They are wrong in the things they judge, for they don't know God, and they wish to call evil, sin, and unrighteousness just.
Wisdom 12:5 Because of this, you, O Lord, will justly punish the wicked, with the evils they have chosen.
Wisdom 12:6 For your power has not escaped you. You combine justice with your strength.
Wisdom 12:7 For if you judge the just to be powerful, it is not because you think they aren’t strong, or that you don’t care, since you have all power.
Wisdom 12:8 Showing your power to the ones who judge justly. When you are scorned, show your power to those who do not believe in your perfection.
Wisdom 12:9 But you, Lord of power, judge justly and guide us with clemency.
Wisdom 12:10 Because when you want to, you can. For you know the power of your strength.
Wisdom 12:11 And you show your justice to those who do not believe that you are full of strength, and their wickedness to those who have made you out to be ignorant.
Wisdom 12:12 Because after this, when they are ignorant, they will be punished and will grieve.
Wisdom 12:13 Because of this, you have given torment to those who have lived wickedly. You have given the lives that displease you.
Wisdom 12:14 They detested iniquity and the wicked kinds of lives.
Wisdom 12:15 The proof of this is still present because they judged in what they suffered, and they were vindicated in what displeased them.
Wisdom 12:16 And because of this, the wicked, with torment, judged, thinking they were from you, who unjustly did evil things.
Wisdom 12:17 For in the things they sinned in, which they thought were good, they received the punishment of iniquity.
Wisdom 12:18 But others, even the just, they thought weren't worthy of understanding and did not follow their ways. They looked down on their wickedness.
Wisdom 12:19 For they scorned the wicked, and were justly condemned.
Wisdom 12:20 To others, they didn't give offerings, and their works were not known.
Wisdom 12:21 For they, whose works were evil, lost them, and were confused in their wickedness.
Wisdom 12:22 And after this, those who perished felt what they had done with sorrow and are now confused.
Wisdom 12:23 For your judgment is just.
Wisdom 12:24 This is what cast down the wicked: because they scorned the good things they did, and they did not believe in your judgments.
Wisdom 12:25 And because of this, their end is terrible, and their grief is without end.
Wisdom 13:1 Indeed, all people who do not know God are foolish. Although they see all the good that exists, they can not understand the One who is. They have not recognized the artisan, even by considering the work of creation.
Wisdom 13:2 Instead, they worshiped fire, the wind, the swift air, the circle of stars, the violent water, or the sun and the moon, which they considered to be the rulers of the universe.
Wisdom 13:3 If, because they were delighted by such things, they considered them gods, then let them know that there are things far more beautiful than those. The Lord, who created them, is also the Master of all creation.
Wisdom 13:4 If they were astonished by the things they made, because of their power and effect, then let them understand that the One who created them is even more powerful.
Wisdom 13:5 They could have known the One who is by means of these things, for they are evident, and they should have seen Him through the creation.
Wisdom 13:6 However, they are not excusable for this. If they were capable of knowing the world well enough to judge it, how did they not more easily find the Lord of those things?
Wisdom 13:7 They are wretched, and their hope is in the dead. They say that the gods are things made by human hands: gold, silver, crafted statues of animals, useless stone—the work of human hands.
Wisdom 13:8 If they live with such things, then they consider such things good, and place their hope in those things which are dead.
Wisdom 13:9 They are evil because they hope in these things, and they become bad. They have not seen the ways of justice, nor have they entered the paths of righteousness.
Wisdom 13:10 They have not learned justice, nor have they come to know what is good. They have considered the work of their hands to be God, but it is perverse.
Wisdom 13:11 Because of this, mockery will come upon them on the day of judgment.
Wisdom 13:12 It is better not to exist than to exist and commit impiety. It is better to not know God than to not know the life of one who does not know Him.
Wisdom 13:13 Those who seek God, will find Him, and they will not abandon Him.
Wisdom 13:14 He did not reveal to them, nor did He show them, what is evil, so that they would know what is good, and what things oppose them, and through which they will receive even more light.
Wisdom 13:15 For all of their works are more beautiful in this world than their hope, as are the people themselves, and the things they desire.
Wisdom 13:16 Even those who exist in this world will die, and that is why these things are vanity. These are their works, always with them, in which they always hope.
Wisdom 13:17 They will obtain mercy and grace because they have abstained from these things.
Wisdom 14:1 It is vanity to have idols, and the making of them is an act of destruction. The beginning of a spiritual death, and the true source of life's corruption.
Wisdom 14:2 These idols are not real, and they will not last. Therefore, a sudden judgment will come upon all who trust in them.
Wisdom 14:3 For what is the point of a father, working through the pain of his labor, shaping an idol without a soul, a worthless image?
Wisdom 14:4 But the works of such men are dead, and they themselves, together with those they make—they are all dead together.
Wisdom 14:5 They stray together, and those who praise these idols hope in the dead.
Wisdom 14:6 Therefore, because they deserve it, these things happen to them. They also say, “These idols are not good, nor are they alive, for they cannot see us, nor can they hear us, nor can they think, nor can they move.
Wisdom 14:7 They say, “We are the masters of our own fates.
Wisdom 14:8 They say, “We are the masters of our own fates. Each man can live his life.”
Wisdom 14:9 Their idols are but wind. And such wicked men call these idols gods.
Wisdom 14:10 Those who sail on ships across the sea, and who labor in storms, calling out to wood, call out to wooden idols.
Wisdom 14:11 This is how evil began, and why men go astray, and why there is discord.
Wisdom 14:12 For what is it? That which they have made is not good, and that which they have said is nothing.
Wisdom 14:13 For God hates the ungodly, and the ungodliness of men is similarly abominable to Him.
Wisdom 14:14 Therefore, the ungodly will be abominable, and the ungodliness of the ungodly will be as well.
Wisdom 14:15 Therefore, the works of the wicked are a punishment for them.
Wisdom 14:16 Because the wicked have thought that God is evil, and have done wicked deeds, and are worthy of death, they say: “There is no life.” And they thought the wicked should be God.
Wisdom 14:17 Those who do such things are worthy to be punished, and those who think there is no God, are not.
Wisdom 14:18 For the wicked do wicked deeds, speak impious words, and live wicked lives—and these things will cause harm to men.
Wisdom 14:19 Because they thought fire was God, and they saw it die for a while, and then when the wind blew, it would burn up: and they thought that only fire was the Lord of all things.
Wisdom 14:20 They considered fire, wind, the swift spirit of the air, the circle of the stars, raging water, the sun, and the moon to be the rulers of the world.
Wisdom 14:21 If they loved their beauty, they thought they were gods: those who they saw working.
Wisdom 14:22 If they loved these, they should have known that these are far better: for their creator is beauty itself, and that which is created is found in what is being worked: and what they see is not in those who do the working.
Wisdom 14:23 But they are not excused: because they do not know God by these things, and in those who do the working, they have not considered who He is.
Wisdom 14:24 Perhaps those who wander a little are excused: for they desired God, and wanted to find Him, they did not err in the things they see.
Wisdom 14:25 But neither do these men know, because they seek, investigate, and err in His works, when searching for God.
Wisdom 14:26 For, like lovers, they see the works and they themselves do not believe, because those things which they see neither are, nor exist. If they work, so does their spirit.
Wisdom 15:1 Truly, all men are fools who lack the knowledge of God, and who, from visible goods, were not able to understand Him Who is, nor by their works did they recognize Who He was.
Wisdom 15:2 Instead, they have considered fire, wind, the swift air, the circle of stars, excessive water, or the sun and moon, the rulers of the world, as gods.
Wisdom 15:3 If they, delighted by their beauty, thought them gods, let them know that these things are much more beautiful than those things. For their splendor, their beauty, their course, and their movement are in the control of God.
Wisdom 15:4 But even they are not worthy of forgiveness. For if they were able to know so much that they could estimate the age of the world, how did they not more easily find its Lord?
Wisdom 15:5 But even they are excusable in this. For perhaps, though wandering, they seek God, and desire to find Him.
Wisdom 15:6 For conversing with His works, they investigate and are deceived by appearance, because they seem good. But again, they are not worthy of forgiveness.
Wisdom 15:7 For if they had so much knowledge that they could examine the world, how did they not more quickly find its Lord?
Wisdom 15:8 But their life is miserable, and their hope is among the dead, those who place their hope in things made by human hands, gold, silver, skillfully made, and the likeness of beasts, or a useless stone from an ancient work.
Wisdom 15:9 Or perhaps a woodworker has carved wood, polished it carefully, and then cast it aside for use. But his labor is for the fullness of life, and the craftsman is in his work.
Wisdom 15:10 But miserable is he who places hope in the dead and calls dead things gods; for he has seen neither the living, nor the holy, nor the true.
Wisdom 15:11 For they act unjustly at the same time, and their works, their pains, and their thoughts are in vain. Because an idol statue is the beginning of fornication, and their invention is the corruption of life.
Wisdom 15:12 For they were not from the beginning, nor will they be forever. Because that vanity is a useless emptiness and iniquity.
Wisdom 15:13 For death entered the world through ambition, and those who are a part of it experience it.
Wisdom 15:14 For acting unjustly, they thought nothing of it, not realizing that in the very things in which they have done evil, they are also punished.
Wisdom 15:15 For the just thought life was short, and they departed and did not hear their own voice; but those who are not just thought, and not knowing the mysteries of God, did not hope for the reward of justice, nor did they judge the prize of an immaculate soul.
Wisdom 15:16 Because God created man to be inexhaustible, and He made him in the image of His own likeness.
Wisdom 15:17 But through the devil's envy, death entered the world.
Wisdom 15:18 And those who are a part of it experience it.
Wisdom 16:1 A wonderful meal appeared for the righteous and holy ones who were in exile.
Wisdom 16:2 So that, after they had suffered adversity and their enemies were punished, they could taste the sweetness of life.
Wisdom 16:3 For that which the animals, who were not supposed to know the ways of men, were mocking.
Wisdom 16:4 They were sent as a punishment, but not in anger. They were punished briefly, and were then found worthy of blessings.
Wisdom 16:5 For those who feared were in servitude. Those who did not fear were tormented.
Wisdom 16:6 Those who were in darkness, and those who were in ignorance, were both in darkness.
Wisdom 16:7 For as those who are asleep, so too were these who slept in a terrible slumber.
Wisdom 16:8 But God did not destroy those people. He warned the wandering, and, remembering His virtues, warned them.
Wisdom 16:9 For through their suffering, He showed Himself to them for salvation. And, being awake, they knew that He, God, was with them at that moment.
Wisdom 16:10 For the sake of the people who came before them, they were killed by animals.
Wisdom 16:11 They were led astray by their wicked and perverse thoughts, and thought those very things that they imagined to be gods.
Wisdom 16:12 They ended in unjust suffering. And the harm was done through them who are.
Wisdom 16:13 For fire or wild beasts that overcame them were punishments for them, and for their wicked deeds.
Wisdom 16:14 On the contrary, nothing happened against them. They themselves are the ones who have done everything.
Wisdom 16:15 For to the just, not only to them, but also to these others, was given night, and they knowing those things which they have suffered, themselves feared not even death.
Wisdom 16:16 And the son of those who were, came quickly. And, seeing, they saw, and knowing, they knew what justice has suffered.
Wisdom 16:17 Afterwards, when the unjust had died, there was a scourge and a plague to them, and for the righteous, glory.
Wisdom 16:18 For in a short time they were tormented, and dying, they saw their works and knew what they had suffered.
Wisdom 16:19 And as they perished, the just had glory. But for them, in short, who were made as they were, with them, to condemnation.
Wisdom 16:20 And therefore they saw both this, and that, and for that time, and when they were in conflict, they saw, and they heard what it is.
Wisdom 16:21 For they were once cast down, and they did not ignore who they were, and who were for them, and who were for death.
Wisdom 16:22 For, that which they had once wandered, and seeing, they did not believe, now, when they suffered, and knowing, they repented for themselves.
Wisdom 16:23 And, that through which they were judged, those things, when they perished, did not die.
Wisdom 16:24 For, when the just were in conflict, they saw all things, and afterwards, in repentance, they saw; and they did not die.
Wisdom 16:25 But, as they perished, so did they perish in them.
Wisdom 17:1 But those who are spiritually dead don’t know God, and they can’t find Him by looking at good things, and they don’t recognize the craftsman by his work.
Wisdom 17:2 Instead, they think that fire, or wind, or fast-moving air, or the stars’ motion, or rushing water, or the sun and moon, which govern the world, are gods.
Wisdom 17:3 If they were charmed by their appearance, they should know that these things are much better than they seem: the creator of them made these very things.
Wisdom 17:4 If they were amazed by their strength and by how they work, let them understand from these things that whoever made them is stronger than they are:
Wisdom 17:5 because by how great and well-made the creation is, they can understand the creator. So, too, His power is known through these things.
Wisdom 17:6 But still, they have no excuse: if they were able to know so much that they could investigate the world, why did they not find the Lord more quickly?
Wisdom 17:7 But woe to them, and to their works: because they thought that the dead were gods, and also idols, and gold, and silver—man-made objects, and images of animals, or a useless stone from the hands of someone long ago.
Wisdom 17:8 Therefore, if they were pleased with what they made, they thought these things were gods: and what excuse will they give now, because they put their hope in these things?
Wisdom 17:9 For they have power over them in both life and death, and they will be punished on the day when they are judged.
Wisdom 17:10 They are miserable, and they hate His holy ones, and they hate the impious, and they hate His things, and the good, and those who hate life, and those who do evil.
Wisdom 17:11 Their works are evil, and their lives are evil: and they think that God is not with them: and they commit iniquity, and they are perverted by their unjust plans.
Wisdom 17:12 There is a different power of evil, and a different lie, and a different life than they think, and for those who made these things, there is an evil cause, so that their sin will follow them through fire, or through water.
Wisdom 17:13 Because what they do to God, and their sins, pursue them in anger, as they themselves are.
Wisdom 17:14 This is what they think: that if they do well, they will reign, and they will exist, and be glorious. For this reason they are also destructive to themselves.
Wisdom 17:15 Therefore they were angry at the just, and for their sin they killed those who were holy and just in life. Their blood is now avenged.
Wisdom 17:16 But they, being angry, were worth nothing, and they knew nothing, being angry at those who were better than them.
Wisdom 17:17 For this reason they died, and they thought that life was for them, and they were saddened when they died: because even they who died were unjust, and they judged iniquity.
Wisdom 17:18 And since God did not always dissimulate, His power did not dissimulate either. Because this man, who is without God, killed the just, and the just and the impious will perish alike.
Wisdom 17:19 For now the works of the impious are like the wind, and like a ship on water without a rudder, which passes, and the path is unknown after it. And like a bird flying through the air, no trace of the journey is found, and like an arrow shot at a target.
Wisdom 17:20 And like an arrow striking through the air, and the air is immediately divided, and its passing is not known. So also we are born for a short time, and immediately we vanish: and we will not be able to show the trace of a good work: but we will be consumed in malice.
Wisdom 18:1 Remembering His covenant, the Lord sent redeemers to rescue them from the pagan nations.
Wisdom 18:2 He sent holy men: Moses and his brother Aaron. Through them, He gave His people a sense of holiness.
Wisdom 18:3 He gave them His testament so they would be sanctified, and the Law so they could have life.
Wisdom 18:4 He revealed His just judgements, and the works that His hands had made.
Wisdom 18:5 Remembering the covenant, He displayed the wonders of His works.
Wisdom 18:6 He glorified them in holiness and kept them in righteousness.
Wisdom 18:7 He heard their prayers from His holy place.
Wisdom 18:8 He was merciful to them in their days of tribulation and rescued them.
Wisdom 18:9 He struck the Egyptians with plagues that were great and terrifying.
Wisdom 18:10 He showed the power of His hands.
Wisdom 18:11 He gave them a great plague to reveal their wickedness, and He destroyed their enemies.
Wisdom 18:12 He gave His holy ones righteousness and a law without deceit.
Wisdom 18:13 He remembered His covenant and the righteousness of His works.
Wisdom 18:14 He gave them the inheritance of the nations, and the works of the just.
Wisdom 18:15 Both the work of the Lord's hands, and the works of the just, are His.
Wisdom 18:16 He broke the power of their enemies, and gave them the inheritance of the strong.
Wisdom 18:17 So that they would glorify His holy name and offer God their praises.
Wisdom 18:18 He rooted out the impious peoples before them.
Wisdom 18:19 So they would praise His works with justice, and glorify His wonders.
Wisdom 18:20 And they will praise Him with the glory of His power, and they will proclaim the greatness of His works.
Wisdom 18:21 This is the end for those who have acted justly, so they may be with Him.
Wisdom 18:22 And with their works, they enter the glory of the saints.
Wisdom 19:1 The nations who opposed Your commandments, Lord, have done the opposite of what is right.
Wisdom 19:2 Your children knew that the wicked are lost,
Wisdom 19:3 and the wicked perished in the open for all of their enemies to see.
Wisdom 19:4 The Gentiles saw the idols,
Wisdom 19:5 which do not even exist, and they thought the idols were gods.
Wisdom 19:6 Therefore, the Gentiles will be judged by the true judge, as will the dead idols.
Wisdom 19:7 So when the time came for punishment, the Lord visited them and found them worthy of their punishment.
Wisdom 19:8 For the Gentiles were using wicked deeds,
Wisdom 19:9 to do even more foolish things,
Wisdom 19:10 because the Gentiles lacked rational thought.
Wisdom 19:11 They sacrificed their own children to demons,
Wisdom 19:12 and they offered these children to those who do not exist, to idols.
Wisdom 19:13 They murdered their own children,
Wisdom 19:14 and they would murder those who were sacrifices,
Wisdom 19:15 using poison that was wicked, and they were destroyed.
Wisdom 19:16 And because of this, the deception that was created by them could no longer remain hidden.
Wisdom 19:17 For those wicked people, who were like people wandering around in a dream,
Wisdom 19:18 imagined they were actually flying when dreaming.
Wisdom 19:19 The Gentiles died because of these delusions, which they trusted in.
Wisdom 19:20 For they thought things that did not exist were gods.
Wisdom 19:21 They swore false oaths, and did evil things with great anger,
Wisdom 19:22 and because of this, they deserved to be destroyed.
Wisdom 19:23 The false gods they swore by did not have any power, instead, the sin itself deserved punishment.
Wisdom 19:24 They would swear oaths that contained injustice, and would be destroyed by these oaths.
